reasons for judgment
judge jenkins
introduction
background
the evidence
the relevant legal principles
in some cases, the determination of “best interests” may well mean that one party’s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child’s “best interests” being served by orders which do not give one parent “optimal” arrangements or outcomes.
a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.
parental responsibility
the considerations pursuant to section 60cc of the act   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
the primary considerations
meaningful relationship
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
risk of harm
...concerns for lack of stability for the children in [ms bannister]'s care (children having no structure, often having mcdonalds and watching movies rated m), [x] who is diagnosed with autism having issues with emotional regulation (hitting himself, spitting and hitting other children at school), [ms bannister]'s mental health (depression) and allegations of [ms bannister] selling synthetic [illegal substances]. (as per the original)
...acknowledged that the children had been traumatised by the previous knife attack at the [business]... she acknowledged that the children heard everything on the phone at that point, noting that [x] had been somewhat disruptive at school and at home. as a result of all these things, [mr tassell] approached [ms bannister] in or about september 2021, having prepared a parenting plan regarding the long term care of the children who were to reside with him and to have substantial time with her.
additional considerations
any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views
i'd feel quite sad, not only leaving my mum but leaving my little brother and sister behind. i play a lot with them. i would not want to leave them and they're my friends because we made such strong connections. and my other friends at school. i could possibly manage. i reckon i could go a fair amount of time. one thing i won't manage is being without dad. i've been with dad my whole life. (as per the original)
i'd be quite happy. jumping off the walls. i'd be sad leaving my dad. we've had awesome adventures together. what's wrong with using skype. we have invented things for a reason, we invented skype. it would be hard for me to decide. i would want to stay at the [suburb o] house. at the [suburb o] house i’ve learnt to cook. last night i made mashed potatoes. i first got my pen licence at mum's house. (as per the original)   was asked how she would feel if the adults decide they will live in [city c] with [mr tassell]. she said, "i wouldn't like it coz i'll only get to see mum on the holidays”. [y] was asked how she would feel if it is decided they live with [ms bannister], she said, "i'd still feel sad because i wouldn't get to see my dad as often. i would see my dad every second weekend". i then explained to [y] that it would only be in the school holiday time. (as per the original)
the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child)
relaxed, comfortable, smiled easily and often, [they] made eye contact... [each parent] was very attentive, providing guidance and structure.
the extent to which each of the child’s parents have taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, to spend time with the child and to communicate with the child
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living   and [y] are both at a developmental age where they are able to retain long-term memory, they are able to manage communication either by phone or facetime, skype or any video concept. [x] and [y] have well developed relationships with both [mr tassell] and with [ms bannister], so such relationships can be maintained over distance. (as per the original)
the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
the parties’ mental health
...“massive” depression and outbursts from the age of 8 onwards which occurred in the context of her mother abandoning her. those emotions have continued with her throughout her life.
little in the way of strong support network, has a longstanding psychiatric illness with depressive and anxious symptoms, somatisation, impressed as having limited insight as to her vulnerability and its impact on the children.
the mother’s work hours  bannister] anticipates that the children will come with her to work. there is a playroom out the back. she acknowledged that in those circumstances she was likely to be “flat out” with four children under the age of 7, working 6-7 days a week. part of the plan is that when the children are with her and home from school, she will close the [business].
the children are only ever left at home if i need to grab something from the [business] which takes no more than five minutes and they are left with a phone in case they need me or anything happens.
school attendance
the children’s access to allied health services
the mother’s concerns about the children in the father’s care
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant
attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
any other face or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
one of the objects of modern family law statutes (including fla 1975 and fca 1975) is to enable parties to a broken relationship to start a new life for themselves, to control their own future destinies and, where desired, to form new relationships, free from unnecessary interference from a former spouse or partner or from a court. courts recognise that unwarranted interference in the life of a custodial parent may itself occasion bitterness towards the former spouse or partner which may be transmitted to the child or otherwise impinge on the happiness of the custodial (or residence) parent in a way likely to affect the welfare or best interests of the child. this said, the touchstone for the ultimate decision must remain the welfare or best interests of the child and not, as such, the wishes and interests of the parents. (footnotes omitted, as per the original)
courts, exercising such discretions, should not ignore the disproportionate burden typically cast upon women by their being effectively immobilised as the custodial/residence parent.
to the extent that the freedom of a parent to move impinges upon those interests then it must give way.
reasonable practicability   in determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child's parents, the court must have regard to: (a) how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   such other matters as the court considers relevant.
