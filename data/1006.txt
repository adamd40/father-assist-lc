ms j, first cousin of wife
the wife’s application for a declaration that the financial agreement dated 7 march 2016 is binding on the parties
when financial agreements are binding (1) subject to subsection (1a), a financial agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement if, and only if:   the agreement is signed by all parties, and (b) before signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner about the effect of the agreement on the rights of that party and about the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to that party of making the agreement, and (c) either before or after signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that the advice referred to in paragraph (b) was provided to that party (whether or not the statement is annexed to the agreement), and (ca) a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (c) that was provided to a spouse party is given to the other spouse party or to a legal practitioner for the other spouse party, and (d) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.  ) a financial agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement if:   the agreement is signed by all parties, and (b) one or more of paragraphs (1)(b), (c) and (ca) are not satisfied in relation to the agreement, and (c) a court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made), and (d) the court makes an order under subsection (1b) declaring that the agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, and (e) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.  ) for the purposes of paragraph (1a)(d), a court may make an order declaring that a financial agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, upon application (the enforcement application ) by a spouse party seeking to enforce the agreement. (1c) to avoid doubt, section 90ka applies in relation to the enforcement application. (2) a court may make such orders for the enforcement of a financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement as it thinks necessary.
.... finally, we agree with justice thackray that it would be unwise to close off at this early stage possible interpretations of paragraph (c), but it is plain from the words of that paragraph and from the purpose of s 90g in allowing the parties to make whatever bargain they wish, the justice and equity, or the fairness of the terms of the agreement cannot be considered in the exercise of the discretion. thus, to so determine does not close off a possible interpretation of the paragraph. thus, we conclude that the trial judge was in error in finding that a relevant enquiry in exercising the discretion under s 90g(1)(c) is as to whether “the terms of the bargain itself offend ordinary notions of fairness or plainly fall markedly outside any reasonable broad assessment of the s 79 discretion”.

how the parties have acted subsequently in relation to the agreement (bearing in mind that changes of circumstances cannot be considered)  on 7 july 2016, $20,000 was transferred to the wife, (b) on 8 july 2016, $20,000 was transferred to company k. later, and before the parties’ final separation, the husband was repaid about $4,500 from those funds of $20,000, however the husband is unsure as to what happened to the balance of monies invested with company k, (c) on 11 july 2016, a further $10,000 was transferred to company k, the balance of funds were utilised to complete the paperwork to have the unit approved by council as well as to cover the parties’ day-to-day living expenses.   on 8 july 2016, $20,000 was transferred to company k. later, and before the parties’ final separation, the husband was repaid about $4,500 from those funds of $20,000, however the husband is unsure as to what happened to the balance of monies invested with company k, (c) on 11 july 2016, a further $10,000 was transferred to company k, the balance of funds were utilised to complete the paperwork to have the unit approved by council as well as to cover the parties’ day-to-day living expenses.   on 11 july 2016, a further $10,000 was transferred to company k, the balance of funds were utilised to complete the paperwork to have the unit approved by council as well as to cover the parties’ day-to-day living expenses.
