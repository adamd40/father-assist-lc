relevant legal principles  n exercising its discretion to award or refuse costs, a court should look at the matter primarily from the perspective of the defendant. to do so conforms to fundamental principle. if one thing is clear in the realm of costs, it is that, in criminal as well as civil proceedings, costs are not awarded by way of punishment of an unsuccessful party. they are compensatory in the sense that they are awarded to indemnify the successful party against the expense to which he or she has been put by reason of the legal proceedings.   where it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where a party properly advised should have known that he had no chance of success. in such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts,[13] (b) making allegations of fraud, knowing them to be false, and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud,[14] (c) evidence of particular misconduct causing loss of time to the court and to other parties,[15] (d) the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   making allegations of fraud, knowing them to be false, and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud,[14] (c) evidence of particular misconduct causing loss of time to the court and to other parties,[15] (d) the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   evidence of particular misconduct causing loss of time to the court and to other parties,[15] (d) the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.
