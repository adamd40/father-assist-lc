whether it is just and equitable that orders be made
major areas of dispute   the events and circumstances surrounding the parties’ interests in g pty ltd and f pty ltd (collectively the f & g pty ltd companies) and the business known as k company, and (b) assertions made by the wife that the husband engaged in conduct in relation to two mediations and broader attempts to resolve the matter, which led to her incurring significant losses.   assertions made by the wife that the husband engaged in conduct in relation to two mediations and broader attempts to resolve the matter, which led to her incurring significant losses.
g pty ltd and f pty ltd   g pty ltd and f pty ltd were incorporated in 2015 for the purpose of operating k company, which was purchased by g pty ltd as an established business for the sum of $190,000. prior to the purchase, the wife had been working as an employee of k company. (b) at around the same time, f pty ltd purchased the commercial property from which the k company business was operating, being the l street property, for $630,000 ($572,272.27 plus gst). (c) both purchases were funded by borrowings from anz bank secured by the farming properties. at the same time, the parties refinanced all of their personal and business borrowings from the commonwealth bank to anz. the parties both gave personal guarantees to anz bank with respect to the borrowings. (d) the parties obtained an overdraft with a limit of $200,000 and a credit card with a balance of $50,000 for the purpose of the operation of the business. they also entered into a credit contract with a supplier, m company, with a limit of $100,000, pursuant to which they each gave personal guarantees in late 2015. (e) the wife managed the k company business from the time of its purchase. (f) according to the wife’s evidence, in 2016 and 2017, k company experienced significant and unexpected growth and did not have sufficient capital available to handle that growth, resulting in an inability to pay suppliers in a timely manner, which led to delay in the provision of materials, which in turn affected the ability of the business to fulfil its orders. the husband alleged that the growth resulted from the wife irresponsibly slashing profit margins. this was credibly denied by the wife, who gave evidence that both she and the former owners had operated at a margin of approximately 20 percent, although she admitted that she was overwhelmed by the sudden growth of the business and could have made better management decisions such as refusing contracts. under cross-examination, it was put to the husband that there had been a significant increase in gross income. he evaded the question. he acknowledged that he had been aware that the number of employees had increased and that the business was growing. noting that the husband’s evidence was that he was told nothing about the operation of the business and that he denied having seen the books for the business, it is not possible to accept his evidence as to the manner in which it was operated or the reasons for its financial difficulties. i accept the evidence of the wife in this regard. (g) in mid-2017, the k company overdraft was extended from $200,000 to $300,000.[4] the husband’s evidence was that the wife procured this extension without his consent. the wife’s evidence was that she had made the application prior to discussing the matter with the husband, the bank had erroneously extended the limit without the husband’s consent, and when the husband refused to sign the necessary documents, the original limit had been restored. the wife was not challenged on her evidence that the original limit had been restored shortly after the extension, but this fact was not disclosed by the husband, whose evidence gave the impression that the wife had had the benefit of an extension of the overdraft which had occurred without his consent. this reflects poorly on his credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (h) it is not a matter of contention that by early 2018, cash flow for k company had become a major concern. the wife commenced lending funds from the partnership through which she and the husband operated the farming enterprise (for which she was undertaking the bookkeeping) to g pty ltd, largely for the purpose of making payments of wages, in order to assist with the cash flow difficulties experienced by g pty ltd. she admitted that she had not informed the husband of this and that he had not become aware of these transactions until after the parties had separated. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the funds had all been repaid within a matter of days and that as at 30 june 2018, g pty ltd did not owe any funds to the partnership. the husband alleged that further funds were taken from the partnership by the wife after 30 june 2018 and were not repaid. this allegation was not particularised and no independent evidence was adduced to support it. i reject this evidence. i accept the submission of counsel for the wife that there is no evidence or even suggestion that the wife applied the funds for her personal use or used them for purposes other than to assist the operation of the k company business. counsel for the husband confirmed during closing submissions that the husband did not press for a finding that any debt owed by g pty ltd to the farming partnership was carried forward after 30 june 2018 and did not seek that the wife’s conduct in this regard have any consequential effect on the orders of the court. (i) in early 2018, the wife caused g pty ltd to enter into a contract with a supplier, n company and gave a personal guarantee. this occurred without the husband’s knowledge or consent. (j) the parties separated on 12 march 2018. (k) the wife’s evidence was that in approximately mid-2018, the parties met with mr o, the accountant for the f & g pty ltd companies and k company, who advised them that a cash injection would be required to enable g pty ltd to trade out of its cash flow difficulties. the husband deposed that he met with mr o in early 2018 but denied the wife was present. i accept the wife’s evidence. the parties agree that the husband was not prepared to secure any further funding against the farming properties by agreeing to an extension of the k company overdraft. (l) in late 2018, the wife met with mr o and representatives of p company, a partner of which firm was ultimately appointed as liquidator of g pty ltd. the wife did not inform the husband of this meeting. (m) in late 2018, mr o wrote to the parties[5] and indicated, inter alia, that there was very little prospect of the company trading out of its cash flow difficulties, that it was likely to be trading insolvent shortly if it was not already, and that without an injection of funds in the order of $200,000 to $250,000, it would likely be forced into liquidation. (n) in late 2018, the husband, his accountant and his solicitor met with mr o. mr o acted as the wife’s proxy. the husband’s evidence was that mr o advised them that g pty ltd was insolvent. the wife disputed this and deposed that the advice given by mr o was that without a further injection of funds the company was at risk of becoming insolvent.[6] although the parties disagree as to quantum, it is agreed that mr o advised them that g pty ltd required more capital in order to purchase the materials required to fulfil its contracts, and that it would otherwise need to be placed into liquidation. i accept the wife’s evidence, which is consistent with a letter from the accountant dated late 2018[7] that the further injection of funds required was in the vicinity of $200-250,000. it is not a matter of dispute that the husband was not prepared to inject further funds into g pty ltd, and as a result, it was resolved (with mr o voting as the wife’s proxy) that the company would be placed into liquidation. (o) g pty ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in late 2018. at the time of the liquidation, the overdraft balance was $192,873.14. the company also owed funds to suppliers. the wife’s evidence was that the total debt owed by g pty ltd as at the time it went into liquidation was approximately $575,000, which included the sum of $190,000 initially applied to the purchase of the k company business. the husband asserted that the debt at the time of the liquidation was approximately $700,000 but conceded under cross-examination that he did not know whether that was correct or not. i accept the evidence of the wife, which is consistent with the letter sent by mr o in late 2018.[8] (p) from the time g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, k company ceased operating from the l street property, and f pty ltd ceased receiving rental income in relation to that property. the wife’s evidence was that this led to an increase of $70,000 in the balance of the loan held by f pty ltd in relation to that property. this was conceded by the husband under cross-examination. (q) in late 2018, the parties received a letter of demand from solicitors known as q firm on behalf of m company demanding payment of the sum of $124,214 of a debt owed by g pty ltd to m company, pursuant to the personal guarantees that had been given by the parties. m company had lodged caveats over the titles to the b street property and the properties at d street, town c and lots 1 and 2, e street in late 2018. (r) the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that following the liquidation, she was approached by a mr r, who proposed that she be involved in the purchase of k company from the liquidator. in 2018, a company known as s pty ltd was incorporated for the purpose of the proposed purchase of k company. mr r was the sole director. the wife was the secretary. initially, the wife and mr r were equal shareholders, holding five shares each. the proposal for the purchase involved mr r providing the sum of $150,000 by way of loan to s pty ltd for the purpose of providing capital to the business. it is common ground that the wife did not inform the husband of this proposal. (s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment. (y) in mid-2019, the wife received a letter from q law firm on behalf of m company demanding the sum of $43,628.19 (including interest and penalties) pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in 2015. (z) in mid-2020, the husband belatedly proposed that a lease be offered to s pty ltd in respect of the l street property. his proposal included terms which were not acceptable to the wife, including a rental amount that she considered excessive and payment of the rent into his solicitor’s trust account rather than into the loan encumbering the l street property. the wife did not agree to this proposal. (aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (gg) in early 2022, the l street property was sold for $1,150,000 plus gst. settlement of the sale took place in mid-2022. f pty ltd received net sale proceeds of $53,581 after reimbursement of sale costs paid by the husband, funds applied to the reduction of loans by the anz bank, and funds set aside for payment of the gst. these funds were deposited into the overdraft associated with the farming enterprise. the wife alleged that this deposit occurred at the husband’s insistence and that it may have given rise to a division 7a taxation liability. there is no expert evidence before the court to establish that such a liability exists or the quantum of such liability and i note that neither party sought that it be included in the list of assets and liabilities available for distribution. the capital gains taxation liability arising from the sale has been calculated as $172,500.[10] the husband conceded under cross-examination that the sale of the l street property had yielded significantly greater proceeds than it would have done at the time he had initially sought to sell it.   at around the same time, f pty ltd purchased the commercial property from which the k company business was operating, being the l street property, for $630,000 ($572,272.27 plus gst). (c) both purchases were funded by borrowings from anz bank secured by the farming properties. at the same time, the parties refinanced all of their personal and business borrowings from the commonwealth bank to anz. the parties both gave personal guarantees to anz bank with respect to the borrowings. (d) the parties obtained an overdraft with a limit of $200,000 and a credit card with a balance of $50,000 for the purpose of the operation of the business. they also entered into a credit contract with a supplier, m company, with a limit of $100,000, pursuant to which they each gave personal guarantees in late 2015. (e) the wife managed the k company business from the time of its purchase. (f) according to the wife’s evidence, in 2016 and 2017, k company experienced significant and unexpected growth and did not have sufficient capital available to handle that growth, resulting in an inability to pay suppliers in a timely manner, which led to delay in the provision of materials, which in turn affected the ability of the business to fulfil its orders. the husband alleged that the growth resulted from the wife irresponsibly slashing profit margins. this was credibly denied by the wife, who gave evidence that both she and the former owners had operated at a margin of approximately 20 percent, although she admitted that she was overwhelmed by the sudden growth of the business and could have made better management decisions such as refusing contracts. under cross-examination, it was put to the husband that there had been a significant increase in gross income. he evaded the question. he acknowledged that he had been aware that the number of employees had increased and that the business was growing. noting that the husband’s evidence was that he was told nothing about the operation of the business and that he denied having seen the books for the business, it is not possible to accept his evidence as to the manner in which it was operated or the reasons for its financial difficulties. i accept the evidence of the wife in this regard. (g) in mid-2017, the k company overdraft was extended from $200,000 to $300,000.[4] the husband’s evidence was that the wife procured this extension without his consent. the wife’s evidence was that she had made the application prior to discussing the matter with the husband, the bank had erroneously extended the limit without the husband’s consent, and when the husband refused to sign the necessary documents, the original limit had been restored. the wife was not challenged on her evidence that the original limit had been restored shortly after the extension, but this fact was not disclosed by the husband, whose evidence gave the impression that the wife had had the benefit of an extension of the overdraft which had occurred without his consent. this reflects poorly on his credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife.

(aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (gg) in early 2022, the l street property was sold for $1,150,000 plus gst. settlement of the sale took place in mid-2022. f pty ltd received net sale proceeds of $53,581 after reimbursement of sale costs paid by the husband, funds applied to the reduction of loans by the anz bank, and funds set aside for payment of the gst. these funds were deposited into the overdraft associated with the farming enterprise. the wife alleged that this deposit occurred at the husband’s insistence and that it may have given rise to a division 7a taxation liability. there is no expert evidence before the court to establish that such a liability exists or the quantum of such liability and i note that neither party sought that it be included in the list of assets and liabilities available for distribution. the capital gains taxation liability arising from the sale has been calculated as $172,500.[10] the husband conceded under cross-examination that the sale of the l street property had yielded significantly greater proceeds than it would have done at the time he had initially sought to sell it.   both purchases were funded by borrowings from anz bank secured by the farming properties. at the same time, the parties refinanced all of their personal and business borrowings from the commonwealth bank to anz. the parties both gave personal guarantees to anz bank with respect to the borrowings. (d) the parties obtained an overdraft with a limit of $200,000 and a credit card with a balance of $50,000 for the purpose of the operation of the business. they also entered into a credit contract with a supplier, m company, with a limit of $100,000, pursuant to which they each gave personal guarantees in late 2015. (e) the wife managed the k company business from the time of its purchase. (f) according to the wife’s evidence, in 2016 and 2017, k company experienced significant and unexpected growth and did not have sufficient capital available to handle that growth, resulting in an inability to pay suppliers in a timely manner, which led to delay in the provision of materials, which in turn affected the ability of the business to fulfil its orders. the husband alleged that the growth resulted from the wife irresponsibly slashing profit margins. this was credibly denied by the wife, who gave evidence that both she and the former owners had operated at a margin of approximately 20 percent, although she admitted that she was overwhelmed by the sudden growth of the business and could have made better management decisions such as refusing contracts. under cross-examination, it was put to the husband that there had been a significant increase in gross income. he evaded the question. he acknowledged that he had been aware that the number of employees had increased and that the business was growing. noting that the husband’s evidence was that he was told nothing about the operation of the business and that he denied having seen the books for the business, it is not possible to accept his evidence as to the manner in which it was operated or the reasons for its financial difficulties. i accept the evidence of the wife in this regard. (g) in mid-2017, the k company overdraft was extended from $200,000 to $300,000.[4] the husband’s evidence was that the wife procured this extension without his consent. the wife’s evidence was that she had made the application prior to discussing the matter with the husband, the bank had erroneously extended the limit without the husband’s consent, and when the husband refused to sign the necessary documents, the original limit had been restored. the wife was not challenged on her evidence that the original limit had been restored shortly after the extension, but this fact was not disclosed by the husband, whose evidence gave the impression that the wife had had the benefit of an extension of the overdraft which had occurred without his consent. this reflects poorly on his credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (h) it is not a matter of contention that by early 2018, cash flow for k company had become a major concern. the wife commenced lending funds from the partnership through which she and the husband operated the farming enterprise (for which she was undertaking the bookkeeping) to g pty ltd, largely for the purpose of making payments of wages, in order to assist with the cash flow difficulties experienced by g pty ltd. she admitted that she had not informed the husband of this and that he had not become aware of these transactions until after the parties had separated. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the funds had all been repaid within a matter of days and that as at 30 june 2018, g pty ltd did not owe any funds to the partnership. the husband alleged that further funds were taken from the partnership by the wife after 30 june 2018 and were not repaid. this allegation was not particularised and no independent evidence was adduced to support it. i reject this evidence. i accept the submission of counsel for the wife that there is no evidence or even suggestion that the wife applied the funds for her personal use or used them for purposes other than to assist the operation of the k company business. counsel for the husband confirmed during closing submissions that the husband did not press for a finding that any debt owed by g pty ltd to the farming partnership was carried forward after 30 june 2018 and did not seek that the wife’s conduct in this regard have any consequential effect on the orders of the court. (i) in early 2018, the wife caused g pty ltd to enter into a contract with a supplier, n company and gave a personal guarantee. this occurred without the husband’s knowledge or consent. (j) the parties separated on 12 march 2018. (k) the wife’s evidence was that in approximately mid-2018, the parties met with mr o, the accountant for the f & g pty ltd companies and k company, who advised them that a cash injection would be required to enable g pty ltd to trade out of its cash flow difficulties. the husband deposed that he met with mr o in early 2018 but denied the wife was present. i accept the wife’s evidence. the parties agree that the husband was not prepared to secure any further funding against the farming properties by agreeing to an extension of the k company overdraft. (l) in late 2018, the wife met with mr o and representatives of p company, a partner of which firm was ultimately appointed as liquidator of g pty ltd. the wife did not inform the husband of this meeting. (m) in late 2018, mr o wrote to the parties[5] and indicated, inter alia, that there was very little prospect of the company trading out of its cash flow difficulties, that it was likely to be trading insolvent shortly if it was not already, and that without an injection of funds in the order of $200,000 to $250,000, it would likely be forced into liquidation. (n) in late 2018, the husband, his accountant and his solicitor met with mr o. mr o acted as the wife’s proxy. the husband’s evidence was that mr o advised them that g pty ltd was insolvent. the wife disputed this and deposed that the advice given by mr o was that without a further injection of funds the company was at risk of becoming insolvent.[6] although the parties disagree as to quantum, it is agreed that mr o advised them that g pty ltd required more capital in order to purchase the materials required to fulfil its contracts, and that it would otherwise need to be placed into liquidation. i accept the wife’s evidence, which is consistent with a letter from the accountant dated late 2018[7] that the further injection of funds required was in the vicinity of $200-250,000. it is not a matter of dispute that the husband was not prepared to inject further funds into g pty ltd, and as a result, it was resolved (with mr o voting as the wife’s proxy) that the company would be placed into liquidation. (o) g pty ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in late 2018. at the time of the liquidation, the overdraft balance was $192,873.14. the company also owed funds to suppliers. the wife’s evidence was that the total debt owed by g pty ltd as at the time it went into liquidation was approximately $575,000, which included the sum of $190,000 initially applied to the purchase of the k company business. the husband asserted that the debt at the time of the liquidation was approximately $700,000 but conceded under cross-examination that he did not know whether that was correct or not. i accept the evidence of the wife, which is consistent with the letter sent by mr o in late 2018.[8] (p) from the time g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, k company ceased operating from the l street property, and f pty ltd ceased receiving rental income in relation to that property. the wife’s evidence was that this led to an increase of $70,000 in the balance of the loan held by f pty ltd in relation to that property. this was conceded by the husband under cross-examination. (q) in late 2018, the parties received a letter of demand from solicitors known as q firm on behalf of m company demanding payment of the sum of $124,214 of a debt owed by g pty ltd to m company, pursuant to the personal guarantees that had been given by the parties. m company had lodged caveats over the titles to the b street property and the properties at d street, town c and lots 1 and 2, e street in late 2018. (r) the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that following the liquidation, she was approached by a mr r, who proposed that she be involved in the purchase of k company from the liquidator. in 2018, a company known as s pty ltd was incorporated for the purpose of the proposed purchase of k company. mr r was the sole director. the wife was the secretary. initially, the wife and mr r were equal shareholders, holding five shares each. the proposal for the purchase involved mr r providing the sum of $150,000 by way of loan to s pty ltd for the purpose of providing capital to the business. it is common ground that the wife did not inform the husband of this proposal. (s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment. (y) in mid-2019, the wife received a letter from q law firm on behalf of m company demanding the sum of $43,628.19 (including interest and penalties) pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in 2015.

(bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife.

(aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (gg) in early 2022, the l street property was sold for $1,150,000 plus gst. settlement of the sale took place in mid-2022. f pty ltd received net sale proceeds of $53,581 after reimbursement of sale costs paid by the husband, funds applied to the reduction of loans by the anz bank, and funds set aside for payment of the gst. these funds were deposited into the overdraft associated with the farming enterprise. the wife alleged that this deposit occurred at the husband’s insistence and that it may have given rise to a division 7a taxation liability. there is no expert evidence before the court to establish that such a liability exists or the quantum of such liability and i note that neither party sought that it be included in the list of assets and liabilities available for distribution. the capital gains taxation liability arising from the sale has been calculated as $172,500.[10] the husband conceded under cross-examination that the sale of the l street property had yielded significantly greater proceeds than it would have done at the time he had initially sought to sell it.   the wife managed the k company business from the time of its purchase. (f) according to the wife’s evidence, in 2016 and 2017, k company experienced significant and unexpected growth and did not have sufficient capital available to handle that growth, resulting in an inability to pay suppliers in a timely manner, which led to delay in the provision of materials, which in turn affected the ability of the business to fulfil its orders. the husband alleged that the growth resulted from the wife irresponsibly slashing profit margins. this was credibly denied by the wife, who gave evidence that both she and the former owners had operated at a margin of approximately 20 percent, although she admitted that she was overwhelmed by the sudden growth of the business and could have made better management decisions such as refusing contracts. under cross-examination, it was put to the husband that there had been a significant increase in gross income. he evaded the question. he acknowledged that he had been aware that the number of employees had increased and that the business was growing. noting that the husband’s evidence was that he was told nothing about the operation of the business and that he denied having seen the books for the business, it is not possible to accept his evidence as to the manner in which it was operated or the reasons for its financial difficulties. i accept the evidence of the wife in this regard. (g) in mid-2017, the k company overdraft was extended from $200,000 to $300,000.[4] the husband’s evidence was that the wife procured this extension without his consent. the wife’s evidence was that she had made the application prior to discussing the matter with the husband, the bank had erroneously extended the limit without the husband’s consent, and when the husband refused to sign the necessary documents, the original limit had been restored. the wife was not challenged on her evidence that the original limit had been restored shortly after the extension, but this fact was not disclosed by the husband, whose evidence gave the impression that the wife had had the benefit of an extension of the overdraft which had occurred without his consent. this reflects poorly on his credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (h) it is not a matter of contention that by early 2018, cash flow for k company had become a major concern. the wife commenced lending funds from the partnership through which she and the husband operated the farming enterprise (for which she was undertaking the bookkeeping) to g pty ltd, largely for the purpose of making payments of wages, in order to assist with the cash flow difficulties experienced by g pty ltd. she admitted that she had not informed the husband of this and that he had not become aware of these transactions until after the parties had separated. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the funds had all been repaid within a matter of days and that as at 30 june 2018, g pty ltd did not owe any funds to the partnership. the husband alleged that further funds were taken from the partnership by the wife after 30 june 2018 and were not repaid. this allegation was not particularised and no independent evidence was adduced to support it. i reject this evidence. i accept the submission of counsel for the wife that there is no evidence or even suggestion that the wife applied the funds for her personal use or used them for purposes other than to assist the operation of the k company business. counsel for the husband confirmed during closing submissions that the husband did not press for a finding that any debt owed by g pty ltd to the farming partnership was carried forward after 30 june 2018 and did not seek that the wife’s conduct in this regard have any consequential effect on the orders of the court. (i) in early 2018, the wife caused g pty ltd to enter into a contract with a supplier, n company and gave a personal guarantee. this occurred without the husband’s knowledge or consent. (j) the parties separated on 12 march 2018. (k) the wife’s evidence was that in approximately mid-2018, the parties met with mr o, the accountant for the f & g pty ltd companies and k company, who advised them that a cash injection would be required to enable g pty ltd to trade out of its cash flow difficulties. the husband deposed that he met with mr o in early 2018 but denied the wife was present. i accept the wife’s evidence. the parties agree that the husband was not prepared to secure any further funding against the farming properties by agreeing to an extension of the k company overdraft. (l) in late 2018, the wife met with mr o and representatives of p company, a partner of which firm was ultimately appointed as liquidator of g pty ltd. the wife did not inform the husband of this meeting. (m) in late 2018, mr o wrote to the parties[5] and indicated, inter alia, that there was very little prospect of the company trading out of its cash flow difficulties, that it was likely to be trading insolvent shortly if it was not already, and that without an injection of funds in the order of $200,000 to $250,000, it would likely be forced into liquidation. (n) in late 2018, the husband, his accountant and his solicitor met with mr o. mr o acted as the wife’s proxy. the husband’s evidence was that mr o advised them that g pty ltd was insolvent. the wife disputed this and deposed that the advice given by mr o was that without a further injection of funds the company was at risk of becoming insolvent.[6] although the parties disagree as to quantum, it is agreed that mr o advised them that g pty ltd required more capital in order to purchase the materials required to fulfil its contracts, and that it would otherwise need to be placed into liquidation. i accept the wife’s evidence, which is consistent with a letter from the accountant dated late 2018[7] that the further injection of funds required was in the vicinity of $200-250,000. it is not a matter of dispute that the husband was not prepared to inject further funds into g pty ltd, and as a result, it was resolved (with mr o voting as the wife’s proxy) that the company would be placed into liquidation. (o) g pty ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in late 2018. at the time of the liquidation, the overdraft balance was $192,873.14. the company also owed funds to suppliers. the wife’s evidence was that the total debt owed by g pty ltd as at the time it went into liquidation was approximately $575,000, which included the sum of $190,000 initially applied to the purchase of the k company business. the husband asserted that the debt at the time of the liquidation was approximately $700,000 but conceded under cross-examination that he did not know whether that was correct or not. i accept the evidence of the wife, which is consistent with the letter sent by mr o in late 2018.[8] (p) from the time g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, k company ceased operating from the l street property, and f pty ltd ceased receiving rental income in relation to that property. the wife’s evidence was that this led to an increase of $70,000 in the balance of the loan held by f pty ltd in relation to that property. this was conceded by the husband under cross-examination. (q) in late 2018, the parties received a letter of demand from solicitors known as q firm on behalf of m company demanding payment of the sum of $124,214 of a debt owed by g pty ltd to m company, pursuant to the personal guarantees that had been given by the parties. m company had lodged caveats over the titles to the b street property and the properties at d street, town c and lots 1 and 2, e street in late 2018. (r) the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that following the liquidation, she was approached by a mr r, who proposed that she be involved in the purchase of k company from the liquidator. in 2018, a company known as s pty ltd was incorporated for the purpose of the proposed purchase of k company. mr r was the sole director. the wife was the secretary. initially, the wife and mr r were equal shareholders, holding five shares each. the proposal for the purchase involved mr r providing the sum of $150,000 by way of loan to s pty ltd for the purpose of providing capital to the business. it is common ground that the wife did not inform the husband of this proposal. (s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment. (y) in mid-2019, the wife received a letter from q law firm on behalf of m company demanding the sum of $43,628.19 (including interest and penalties) pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in 2015.

(cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife.

(ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (gg) in early 2022, the l street property was sold for $1,150,000 plus gst. settlement of the sale took place in mid-2022. f pty ltd received net sale proceeds of $53,581 after reimbursement of sale costs paid by the husband, funds applied to the reduction of loans by the anz bank, and funds set aside for payment of the gst. these funds were deposited into the overdraft associated with the farming enterprise. the wife alleged that this deposit occurred at the husband’s insistence and that it may have given rise to a division 7a taxation liability. there is no expert evidence before the court to establish that such a liability exists or the quantum of such liability and i note that neither party sought that it be included in the list of assets and liabilities available for distribution. the capital gains taxation liability arising from the sale has been calculated as $172,500.[10] the husband conceded under cross-examination that the sale of the l street property had yielded significantly greater proceeds than it would have done at the time he had initially sought to sell it.   in mid-2017, the k company overdraft was extended from $200,000 to $300,000.[4] the husband’s evidence was that the wife procured this extension without his consent. the wife’s evidence was that she had made the application prior to discussing the matter with the husband, the bank had erroneously extended the limit without the husband’s consent, and when the husband refused to sign the necessary documents, the original limit had been restored. the wife was not challenged on her evidence that the original limit had been restored shortly after the extension, but this fact was not disclosed by the husband, whose evidence gave the impression that the wife had had the benefit of an extension of the overdraft which had occurred without his consent. this reflects poorly on his credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (h) it is not a matter of contention that by early 2018, cash flow for k company had become a major concern. the wife commenced lending funds from the partnership through which she and the husband operated the farming enterprise (for which she was undertaking the bookkeeping) to g pty ltd, largely for the purpose of making payments of wages, in order to assist with the cash flow difficulties experienced by g pty ltd. she admitted that she had not informed the husband of this and that he had not become aware of these transactions until after the parties had separated. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the funds had all been repaid within a matter of days and that as at 30 june 2018, g pty ltd did not owe any funds to the partnership. the husband alleged that further funds were taken from the partnership by the wife after 30 june 2018 and were not repaid. this allegation was not particularised and no independent evidence was adduced to support it. i reject this evidence. i accept the submission of counsel for the wife that there is no evidence or even suggestion that the wife applied the funds for her personal use or used them for purposes other than to assist the operation of the k company business. counsel for the husband confirmed during closing submissions that the husband did not press for a finding that any debt owed by g pty ltd to the farming partnership was carried forward after 30 june 2018 and did not seek that the wife’s conduct in this regard have any consequential effect on the orders of the court. (i) in early 2018, the wife caused g pty ltd to enter into a contract with a supplier, n company and gave a personal guarantee. this occurred without the husband’s knowledge or consent. (j) the parties separated on 12 march 2018. (k) the wife’s evidence was that in approximately mid-2018, the parties met with mr o, the accountant for the f & g pty ltd companies and k company, who advised them that a cash injection would be required to enable g pty ltd to trade out of its cash flow difficulties. the husband deposed that he met with mr o in early 2018 but denied the wife was present. i accept the wife’s evidence. the parties agree that the husband was not prepared to secure any further funding against the farming properties by agreeing to an extension of the k company overdraft. (l) in late 2018, the wife met with mr o and representatives of p company, a partner of which firm was ultimately appointed as liquidator of g pty ltd. the wife did not inform the husband of this meeting. (m) in late 2018, mr o wrote to the parties[5] and indicated, inter alia, that there was very little prospect of the company trading out of its cash flow difficulties, that it was likely to be trading insolvent shortly if it was not already, and that without an injection of funds in the order of $200,000 to $250,000, it would likely be forced into liquidation. (n) in late 2018, the husband, his accountant and his solicitor met with mr o. mr o acted as the wife’s proxy. the husband’s evidence was that mr o advised them that g pty ltd was insolvent. the wife disputed this and deposed that the advice given by mr o was that without a further injection of funds the company was at risk of becoming insolvent.[6] although the parties disagree as to quantum, it is agreed that mr o advised them that g pty ltd required more capital in order to purchase the materials required to fulfil its contracts, and that it would otherwise need to be placed into liquidation. i accept the wife’s evidence, which is consistent with a letter from the accountant dated late 2018[7] that the further injection of funds required was in the vicinity of $200-250,000. it is not a matter of dispute that the husband was not prepared to inject further funds into g pty ltd, and as a result, it was resolved (with mr o voting as the wife’s proxy) that the company would be placed into liquidation. (o) g pty ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in late 2018. at the time of the liquidation, the overdraft balance was $192,873.14. the company also owed funds to suppliers. the wife’s evidence was that the total debt owed by g pty ltd as at the time it went into liquidation was approximately $575,000, which included the sum of $190,000 initially applied to the purchase of the k company business. the husband asserted that the debt at the time of the liquidation was approximately $700,000 but conceded under cross-examination that he did not know whether that was correct or not. i accept the evidence of the wife, which is consistent with the letter sent by mr o in late 2018.[8] (p) from the time g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, k company ceased operating from the l street property, and f pty ltd ceased receiving rental income in relation to that property. the wife’s evidence was that this led to an increase of $70,000 in the balance of the loan held by f pty ltd in relation to that property. this was conceded by the husband under cross-examination. (q) in late 2018, the parties received a letter of demand from solicitors known as q firm on behalf of m company demanding payment of the sum of $124,214 of a debt owed by g pty ltd to m company, pursuant to the personal guarantees that had been given by the parties. m company had lodged caveats over the titles to the b street property and the properties at d street, town c and lots 1 and 2, e street in late 2018. (r) the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that following the liquidation, she was approached by a mr r, who proposed that she be involved in the purchase of k company from the liquidator. in 2018, a company known as s pty ltd was incorporated for the purpose of the proposed purchase of k company. mr r was the sole director. the wife was the secretary. initially, the wife and mr r were equal shareholders, holding five shares each. the proposal for the purchase involved mr r providing the sum of $150,000 by way of loan to s pty ltd for the purpose of providing capital to the business. it is common ground that the wife did not inform the husband of this proposal. (s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment. (y) in mid-2019, the wife received a letter from q law firm on behalf of m company demanding the sum of $43,628.19 (including interest and penalties) pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in 2015. (z) in mid-2020, the husband belatedly proposed that a lease be offered to s pty ltd in respect of the l street property. his proposal included terms which were not acceptable to the wife, including a rental amount that she considered excessive and payment of the rent into his solicitor’s trust account rather than into the loan encumbering the l street property. the wife did not agree to this proposal. (aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife.

(o) g pty ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in late 2018. at the time of the liquidation, the overdraft balance was $192,873.14. the company also owed funds to suppliers. the wife’s evidence was that the total debt owed by g pty ltd as at the time it went into liquidation was approximately $575,000, which included the sum of $190,000 initially applied to the purchase of the k company business. the husband asserted that the debt at the time of the liquidation was approximately $700,000 but conceded under cross-examination that he did not know whether that was correct or not. i accept the evidence of the wife, which is consistent with the letter sent by mr o in late 2018.[8] (p) from the time g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, k company ceased operating from the l street property, and f pty ltd ceased receiving rental income in relation to that property. the wife’s evidence was that this led to an increase of $70,000 in the balance of the loan held by f pty ltd in relation to that property. this was conceded by the husband under cross-examination. (q) in late 2018, the parties received a letter of demand from solicitors known as q firm on behalf of m company demanding payment of the sum of $124,214 of a debt owed by g pty ltd to m company, pursuant to the personal guarantees that had been given by the parties. m company had lodged caveats over the titles to the b street property and the properties at d street, town c and lots 1 and 2, e street in late 2018. (r) the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that following the liquidation, she was approached by a mr r, who proposed that she be involved in the purchase of k company from the liquidator. in 2018, a company known as s pty ltd was incorporated for the purpose of the proposed purchase of k company. mr r was the sole director. the wife was the secretary. initially, the wife and mr r were equal shareholders, holding five shares each. the proposal for the purchase involved mr r providing the sum of $150,000 by way of loan to s pty ltd for the purpose of providing capital to the business. it is common ground that the wife did not inform the husband of this proposal. (s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment. (y) in mid-2019, the wife received a letter from q law firm on behalf of m company demanding the sum of $43,628.19 (including interest and penalties) pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in 2015. (z) in mid-2020, the husband belatedly proposed that a lease be offered to s pty ltd in respect of the l street property. his proposal included terms which were not acceptable to the wife, including a rental amount that she considered excessive and payment of the rent into his solicitor’s trust account rather than into the loan encumbering the l street property. the wife did not agree to this proposal. (aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (gg) in early 2022, the l street property was sold for $1,150,000 plus gst. settlement of the sale took place in mid-2022. f pty ltd received net sale proceeds of $53,581 after reimbursement of sale costs paid by the husband, funds applied to the reduction of loans by the anz bank, and funds set aside for payment of the gst. these funds were deposited into the overdraft associated with the farming enterprise. the wife alleged that this deposit occurred at the husband’s insistence and that it may have given rise to a division 7a taxation liability. there is no expert evidence before the court to establish that such a liability exists or the quantum of such liability and i note that neither party sought that it be included in the list of assets and liabilities available for distribution. the capital gains taxation liability arising from the sale has been calculated as $172,500.[10] the husband conceded under cross-examination that the sale of the l street property had yielded significantly greater proceeds than it would have done at the time he had initially sought to sell it.   the parties separated on 12 march 2018. (k) the wife’s evidence was that in approximately mid-2018, the parties met with mr o, the accountant for the f & g pty ltd companies and k company, who advised them that a cash injection would be required to enable g pty ltd to trade out of its cash flow difficulties. the husband deposed that he met with mr o in early 2018 but denied the wife was present. i accept the wife’s evidence. the parties agree that the husband was not prepared to secure any further funding against the farming properties by agreeing to an extension of the k company overdraft. (l) in late 2018, the wife met with mr o and representatives of p company, a partner of which firm was ultimately appointed as liquidator of g pty ltd. the wife did not inform the husband of this meeting. (m) in late 2018, mr o wrote to the parties[5] and indicated, inter alia, that there was very little prospect of the company trading out of its cash flow difficulties, that it was likely to be trading insolvent shortly if it was not already, and that without an injection of funds in the order of $200,000 to $250,000, it would likely be forced into liquidation.

(ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (gg) in early 2022, the l street property was sold for $1,150,000 plus gst. settlement of the sale took place in mid-2022. f pty ltd received net sale proceeds of $53,581 after reimbursement of sale costs paid by the husband, funds applied to the reduction of loans by the anz bank, and funds set aside for payment of the gst. these funds were deposited into the overdraft associated with the farming enterprise. the wife alleged that this deposit occurred at the husband’s insistence and that it may have given rise to a division 7a taxation liability. there is no expert evidence before the court to establish that such a liability exists or the quantum of such liability and i note that neither party sought that it be included in the list of assets and liabilities available for distribution. the capital gains taxation liability arising from the sale has been calculated as $172,500.[10] the husband conceded under cross-examination that the sale of the l street property had yielded significantly greater proceeds than it would have done at the time he had initially sought to sell it.   in late 2018, the wife met with mr o and representatives of p company, a partner of which firm was ultimately appointed as liquidator of g pty ltd. the wife did not inform the husband of this meeting. (m) in late 2018, mr o wrote to the parties[5] and indicated, inter alia, that there was very little prospect of the company trading out of its cash flow difficulties, that it was likely to be trading insolvent shortly if it was not already, and that without an injection of funds in the order of $200,000 to $250,000, it would likely be forced into liquidation. (n) in late 2018, the husband, his accountant and his solicitor met with mr o. mr o acted as the wife’s proxy. the husband’s evidence was that mr o advised them that g pty ltd was insolvent. the wife disputed this and deposed that the advice given by mr o was that without a further injection of funds the company was at risk of becoming insolvent.[6] although the parties disagree as to quantum, it is agreed that mr o advised them that g pty ltd required more capital in order to purchase the materials required to fulfil its contracts, and that it would otherwise need to be placed into liquidation. i accept the wife’s evidence, which is consistent with a letter from the accountant dated late 2018[7] that the further injection of funds required was in the vicinity of $200-250,000. it is not a matter of dispute that the husband was not prepared to inject further funds into g pty ltd, and as a result, it was resolved (with mr o voting as the wife’s proxy) that the company would be placed into liquidation. (o) g pty ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in late 2018. at the time of the liquidation, the overdraft balance was $192,873.14. the company also owed funds to suppliers. the wife’s evidence was that the total debt owed by g pty ltd as at the time it went into liquidation was approximately $575,000, which included the sum of $190,000 initially applied to the purchase of the k company business. the husband asserted that the debt at the time of the liquidation was approximately $700,000 but conceded under cross-examination that he did not know whether that was correct or not. i accept the evidence of the wife, which is consistent with the letter sent by mr o in late 2018.[8] (p) from the time g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, k company ceased operating from the l street property, and f pty ltd ceased receiving rental income in relation to that property. the wife’s evidence was that this led to an increase of $70,000 in the balance of the loan held by f pty ltd in relation to that property. this was conceded by the husband under cross-examination. (q) in late 2018, the parties received a letter of demand from solicitors known as q firm on behalf of m company demanding payment of the sum of $124,214 of a debt owed by g pty ltd to m company, pursuant to the personal guarantees that had been given by the parties. m company had lodged caveats over the titles to the b street property and the properties at d street, town c and lots 1 and 2, e street in late 2018. (r) the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that following the liquidation, she was approached by a mr r, who proposed that she be involved in the purchase of k company from the liquidator. in 2018, a company known as s pty ltd was incorporated for the purpose of the proposed purchase of k company. mr r was the sole director. the wife was the secretary. initially, the wife and mr r were equal shareholders, holding five shares each. the proposal for the purchase involved mr r providing the sum of $150,000 by way of loan to s pty ltd for the purpose of providing capital to the business. it is common ground that the wife did not inform the husband of this proposal. (s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment. (y) in mid-2019, the wife received a letter from q law firm on behalf of m company demanding the sum of $43,628.19 (including interest and penalties) pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in 2015. (z) in mid-2020, the husband belatedly proposed that a lease be offered to s pty ltd in respect of the l street property. his proposal included terms which were not acceptable to the wife, including a rental amount that she considered excessive and payment of the rent into his solicitor’s trust account rather than into the loan encumbering the l street property. the wife did not agree to this proposal. (aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021.

(aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021. (ee) in or around late 2021, the wife discharged the n company debt using funds she borrowed as detailed later in these reasons. (ff) in early 2022, the wife settled the m company claim against her in the sum of $65,346.82. of this amount, $45,908.45 related to the guarantee given by her in 2015 and the balance to the guarantee given by her in late 2018.[9] in mid-2022, the wife paid the sum owed to m company using funds she borrowed from family, as detailed later in these reasons, together with the sum of $10,000 withdrawn from her superannuation on hardship grounds, and the caveats lodged by m company were removed. under cross-examination, the husband variously alleged that the wife may not have paid this debt, that she had paid it unnecessarily as m company had not in fact pursued her for the payment, and that m company had only pursued her because she had fallen out with them in the context of the s pty ltd endeavour. none of the these allegations appeared in his affidavit material, despite the fact that he filed an affidavit in reply to the wife’s trial affidavit. they contradicted each other and lacked credibility. i accept the evidence of the wife. (gg) in early 2022, the l street property was sold for $1,150,000 plus gst. settlement of the sale took place in mid-2022. f pty ltd received net sale proceeds of $53,581 after reimbursement of sale costs paid by the husband, funds applied to the reduction of loans by the anz bank, and funds set aside for payment of the gst. these funds were deposited into the overdraft associated with the farming enterprise. the wife alleged that this deposit occurred at the husband’s insistence and that it may have given rise to a division 7a taxation liability. there is no expert evidence before the court to establish that such a liability exists or the quantum of such liability and i note that neither party sought that it be included in the list of assets and liabilities available for distribution. the capital gains taxation liability arising from the sale has been calculated as $172,500.[10] the husband conceded under cross-examination that the sale of the l street property had yielded significantly greater proceeds than it would have done at the time he had initially sought to sell it.   g pty ltd was placed into voluntary liquidation in late 2018. at the time of the liquidation, the overdraft balance was $192,873.14. the company also owed funds to suppliers. the wife’s evidence was that the total debt owed by g pty ltd as at the time it went into liquidation was approximately $575,000, which included the sum of $190,000 initially applied to the purchase of the k company business. the husband asserted that the debt at the time of the liquidation was approximately $700,000 but conceded under cross-examination that he did not know whether that was correct or not. i accept the evidence of the wife, which is consistent with the letter sent by mr o in late 2018.[8] (p) from the time g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, k company ceased operating from the l street property, and f pty ltd ceased receiving rental income in relation to that property. the wife’s evidence was that this led to an increase of $70,000 in the balance of the loan held by f pty ltd in relation to that property. this was conceded by the husband under cross-examination. (q) in late 2018, the parties received a letter of demand from solicitors known as q firm on behalf of m company demanding payment of the sum of $124,214 of a debt owed by g pty ltd to m company, pursuant to the personal guarantees that had been given by the parties. m company had lodged caveats over the titles to the b street property and the properties at d street, town c and lots 1 and 2, e street in late 2018. (r) the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that following the liquidation, she was approached by a mr r, who proposed that she be involved in the purchase of k company from the liquidator. in 2018, a company known as s pty ltd was incorporated for the purpose of the proposed purchase of k company. mr r was the sole director. the wife was the secretary. initially, the wife and mr r were equal shareholders, holding five shares each. the proposal for the purchase involved mr r providing the sum of $150,000 by way of loan to s pty ltd for the purpose of providing capital to the business. it is common ground that the wife did not inform the husband of this proposal. (s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment.

(s) on or around 6 november 2018, the wife sent an email to the husband proposing that f pty ltd lease the l street property to s pty ltd at rent of $5,500 per month plus outgoings. the husband did not agree. it is not a matter of contention between the parties that the wife had not informed the husband of her involvement with s pty ltd or her intention to acquire the k company business from the liquidator prior to sending this email. in subsequent correspondence and communications between their respective solicitors, the wife outlined details of the proposed purchase of k company by s pty ltd, together with her concerns that refusal of the lease would jeopardise both the purchase and the ability of f pty ltd to make the required repayments towards the loan secured by the l street property. the husband persisted in his refusal, and expressed a preference that the l street property be sold and the proceeds applied to the loan secured by the property, with any remaining balance being used to extinguish any remaining debts associated with k company and otherwise held on trust for the parties pending resolution of these proceedings. the wife sought to retain the l street property in order to continue operating the k company business and did not consent to its sale. the husband was put on notice that if he did not consent to the lease, any consequent losses would be sought against him by the wife. the husband did not consent. (t) shortly after g pty ltd was placed into liquidation, the majority of the plant and equipment and stock of k company were purchased from the liquidator by t pty ltd, a company of which a mr u was the sole director and shareholder. mr u was also a director of m company. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that this purchase was at market value and that she was not involved in the associated negotiations. t pty ltd then sold the business assets to s pty ltd for the price of $150,000, upon the provision of vendor finance. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that mr r continued to hold five shares in s pty ltd, while the wife held two shares and t pty ltd three shares, with the agreement being that the three shares held by t pty ltd would be transferred back to the wife upon repayment of the vendor finance. the wife and mr r were the managers of k company following the purchase. the wife drew an income of $85,000 per annum in that role. (u) in late 2018, the wife received a letter from law firm v law firm on behalf of n company demanding the sum of $55,814.51 pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in march 2018. n company had lodged a caveat over the wife’s interest in the b street property in late 2018. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that the husband refused to allow her to apply matrimonial funds to the repayment of this debt, with the consequence that it increased. (v) in late 2018, s pty ltd entered into a lease with a third party for alternative premises from which to operate k company and relocated the business operations, plant and equipment. the wife’s evidence, which was not undermined in cross-examination, was that the move incurred expenses and losses of approximately $20,000-$30,000. in late 2018, the wife gave a further personal guarantee to m company in order to continue the operation of k company. (w) in early 2019, each of the parties claimed to have entered into negotiations with m company in relation to repayment of the debt owed to them. the husband alleged that the wife did not do so. the wife’s evidence was that she not only had she engaged in negotiations with both m company and n company via her solicitors, but she had kept the husband informed of her negotiations, and had not been informed by the husband of his negotiation attempts. the husband conceded under cross-examination that he had not kept her informed. i accept the evidence of the wife. (x) in early 2019, the husband was served with a claim brought in the magistrates court by m company in the sum of $98,083.60. in mid-2019, the husband settled the magistrates court claim by way of a payment in the sum of $75,000. the husband applied funds from the income of the farming enterprise to meet this payment. (y) in mid-2019, the wife received a letter from q law firm on behalf of m company demanding the sum of $43,628.19 (including interest and penalties) pursuant to the personal guarantee she had given in 2015. (z) in mid-2020, the husband belatedly proposed that a lease be offered to s pty ltd in respect of the l street property. his proposal included terms which were not acceptable to the wife, including a rental amount that she considered excessive and payment of the rent into his solicitor’s trust account rather than into the loan encumbering the l street property. the wife did not agree to this proposal. (aa) in late 2020, the k company business was moved back into the l street property and further relocation costs were incurred. in late 2020, the wife caused f pty ltd to grant a lease in relation to the l street property in favour of s pty ltd, for a term of 5 years, with an option to renew for a further period of 2 years. from around late 2020, f pty ltd resumed receiving rental income in relation to the l street property. it is common ground that the husband was not consulted about this lease. the husband alleged that there was a separate agreement, the details of which he was unaware, between m company and s pty ltd. he did not explain how he came to ‘understand’ that such an agreement existed and did not establish this allegation. (bb) in late 2020, n company issued proceedings against the wife in the magistrates court claiming $65,777 including costs and interest. (cc) in late 2021, s pty ltd went into voluntary administration. (dd) the liquidation of g pty ltd was completed in 2021.

contributions during the relationship  a housing project operated via a company known as nn pty ltd in which the parties held a 12.5 percent interest from late 2008. this investment opportunity arose through the wife’s employment. the parties invested the sum of $100,000 into this investment by way of a loan from the commonwealth bank secured by the property at d street, town c. the loan was repaid using dividends received from nn pty ltd within one year. the homes constructed by nn pty ltd were completed in 2011. the wife was employed by the company as an office manager. the wife’s evidence, which was not successfully challenged, was that the dividends received from this investment were applied for joint purposes. the wife’s unchallenged evidence was that her involvement in nn pty ltd facilitated the parties obtaining a 50 percent discount for materials used in a renovation at the property at mm street, town c, or a saving of approximately $15,000, as discussed earlier in these reasons. (b) oo pty ltd, being a venture entered into by the wife in partnership with her son mr h and his associate, mr pp in or around 2010, to develop a single property. the wife’s evidence was that the husband was also involved in this endeavour, but she was cross-examined in relation to an unsigned financial report which appeared to suggest that he was not.[30] in my view, nothing turns on this issue. the parties agree that the wife recouped the funds she invested into this property. the parties do not agree as to whether the funds invested in this venture were derived directly from the partnership or by way of loan. it is not necessary to determine that controversy. the wife also says that she made a modest profit, which was paid into the farming partnership and ultimately into an investment account held by the parties. this evidence was supported by documents that were put to her in cross-examination and i accept it. (c) a farming property at qq street, town rr, which was purchased jointly with two other couples, with each couple contributing $230,000 towards the purchase price and the balance of $252,000 being met by a loan obtained by all three couples with w bank. the parties’ $230,000 contribution was secured by a loan from anz bank secured by the property at ff street, town c. the property was sold in early 2017 and the parties realised a profit of approximately $70,000, which was applied to the farm overdraft.   oo pty ltd, being a venture entered into by the wife in partnership with her son mr h and his associate, mr pp in or around 2010, to develop a single property. the wife’s evidence was that the husband was also involved in this endeavour, but she was cross-examined in relation to an unsigned financial report which appeared to suggest that he was not.[30] in my view, nothing turns on this issue. the parties agree that the wife recouped the funds she invested into this property. the parties do not agree as to whether the funds invested in this venture were derived directly from the partnership or by way of loan. it is not necessary to determine that controversy. the wife also says that she made a modest profit, which was paid into the farming partnership and ultimately into an investment account held by the parties. this evidence was supported by documents that were put to her in cross-examination and i accept it.

12. ...counsel for the husband has referred us to the judgment of demack j. in scott and scott [1977] famca 40, (1977) flc 90-251. he refers us particularly to this passage where his honour says (at p. 76,353):
“in my view land which is used for farming purposes and which is essential to the production of an income is in quite a different category from land which simply provides a place for the family home. if the continued availability of the land is essential to one spouse as a place on which to work and produce income, in my opinion, any property order affecting such land should not affect its production capacity or seriously reduce its income producing potential.” i would agree, with respect, with what his honour there says but with this rider: if arrangements can be made which would relieve the spouse who is working a farm as a farmer, from selling the farm but at the same time doing proper justice to the claim of the spouse who is not living on the farm, then of course those arrangements should be made. his honour, the learned trial judge in this case, has arranged things so far as he can to that end. i appreciate that it is not an ideal situation but few of the cases which come before this court are.
if inherited or donated property was acquired before marriage, and especially where it was worked and developed by the party who received it before marriage, that is an important consideration. by bringing pre-marital assets, however acquired, into the pool, that party is to that extent making a contribution which cannot be matched by the party who brings few, if any, assets into the marriage. if on top of that there is a history of working the property before the marriage, whether as owner or as heir-expectant: james and james [1978] famca 10, (1978) flc 90-487, the contribution is likely to become all the more important.
[...]
in our view, the correct principle was laid down by asche j. in magas and magas [1980] famca 67, (1980) flc 90-885, a decision of the full court on appeal from the family court of western australia. his honour said there at p. 75,591:
"if arrangements can be made which would relieve the spouse who is working a farm as a farmer, from selling the farm but at the same time doing proper justice to the claim of the spouse who is not living on the farm, then of course those arrangements should be made."
however, his honour then went on to say:
"if there is no other way to do that which is just and equitable then a sale must take place. it becomes an incident of the sad fact that, when two persons separate, property which might have given them together a reasonable competence will not be sufficient for each when divided. that is an inescapable situation and cannot be used as an argument to deprive one party of that to which he or she is otherwise properly entitled."
the fact that the subject of property proceedings under sec. 79 is a farm may give rise to considerations as to the way and means by which property division should be effectuated, a matter which will be discussed later, but there is no “farming case'' exception to the ordinary principles applicable under sec. 79 of the act.[49]
