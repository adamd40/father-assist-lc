family report
... [in mid] 2019 a provisional a.v.o. was issued protecting [ms chosar]. [mr chosar] was charged with [multiple offences in mid] 2019. [in mid] 2019, an interim a.v.o. was taken out protecting [ms chosar] and [x]. [in mid] 2019, [mr chosar] was charged with contravention, prohibition or restriction in an a.v.o. [in late] 2019, [mr chosar] said that he pleaded guilty to [one charge] and final 2-year a.v.o. protecting [ms chosar] and [x] was issued. he said that all other charges were withdrawn. he said that the breaches of the a.v.o. were dismissed as the evidence showed [ms chosar] had initiated the contact and forced a friend to be a party against the friend’s wishes. as per his affidavit filed 12th march 2020, on 4th march 2020 the matter was listed at the [suburb t] local court. [mr chosar] pleaded guilty to [one charge] but the [other charge] was withdrawn. he received a conviction [...] and he was issued a conditional release order to be of good behaviour for one year. a utilitarian discount was applied to his guilty plea and [another] charge was withdrawn. [mr chosar] indicated in the affidavit (paragraph 36) that he lodged a severity plea in respect of the [charge] and contested the breach of a.v.o. and entered into a not guilty plea to the charges. this was appealed and [mr chosar] has no conviction as the matter was dealt with under discharge to attend counselling with [dr y]. the severity appeal was listed at the [suburb z] district court [in] 2020 and it was held there be no conviction pursuant to section 32 of the mental health act. [mr chosar]’s severity appeal in regard to [his] conviction was set down for hearing in [mid] 2020. the police documents were sighted. there was an entry that [in late] 2018 [ms chosar] called the police following an argument when [mr chosar] was threating to remove [p]’s belongings from the room. [in early] 2019, there is an entry that the parties argued about moving to a larger house. [mr chosar] allegedly asked [ms chosar] to pack her belongings and leave as they were arguing frequently. the cctv camera footage showed neither party assaulted the other or seemed particularly aggressive towards the other. when the police were interviewed [mr chosar] following the incident [in mid] 2019, [mr chosar] denied that his actions constitute assault or intimidation stating he was justified in using physical force to restrain [ms chosar] to stop her from screaming. ... [mr chosar] said that he had completed two courses neither of which had been court ordered. that included a 6 week [q program] course with [r counsellors] in 2019 which covered topics such as managing emotions, identifying abuse, healthy lifestyle, social skills practice, family, friends and community and action planning. [mr chosar] stated that he has also completed a [s program] with [aa counsellors].   chosar] stated that in [early] 2019, his ex-wife launched a gofundme account to support [mr n] to travel overseas, to which [ms chosar] sent her a demeaning message that she was making the family look poor. [mr chosar] stated that he did not think it was their issue and an initiative that was his ex-wife’s prerogative to initiate. he claimed that caused an issue between [mr chosar] and his ex-wife who argued in [mr n’s] presence. he added that there was a period [in mid] 2019 when his sons stayed with him and [ms chosar] continuously for 3 weeks during which time which his ex‑wife travelled overseas. he claimed that [ms chosar] emotionally abused the children during that time and on their wife’s return, declared that the children had to leave and either stay permanently with their wife or live somewhere else. [mr chosar] asserted that [p] became quite affectionate towards him after he and [ms chosar] married and she would, for example, sit on his lap. he said that [ms chosar] told him she disapproved of any displays of affection towards [p] as she did not want him to have a better relationship with her daughter than she had. he referred to [ms chosar] becoming emotionally dependent on [p] and going to her for comfort when she was upset and crying. [ms chosar] disputed that [mr chosar] had a positive relationship with [p]. she asserted that initially [mr chosar] told [p] that he loved her and wanted to be her father. she claimed that during the marriage, he called her “a piece of shit”, screamed and shouted at her and threatened to throw her out. [ms chosar] stated that she would watch [p] like a hawk to protect her from [mr chosar]. she claimed that [mr chosar] would slap [p] on the back on the pretext that he was toughening her up, get her to sit beside him and he would tickle her roughly or pinch her. she said that [p] would cry and would plead with her to make [mr chosar] happy so he would treat her better. [ms chosar] said that she is happy that [p]’s father is a person who [p] believes loves and cares for her. [ms chosar] reported that [mr chosar] treated his sons similarly poorly. she claimed that initially he told her that they were predominantly with him because otherwise they would run away from their wife. however, she said that once she moved in, she realized that [mr chosar] was not involved in his children’s lives and did not even know what subjects they were doing at school. she referred to intervening and stepping in to protect the children and diffuse the conflict when [mr chosar] yelled at them. [ms chosar] said that there were occasions when she was not so scared of [mr chosar] and yelled at him in retaliation... she asserted that she loved [mr n] and [o], treated them as her own children and advocated for them. she accused [mr chosar] of telling her that he needed a wife figure for his children. she claimed that she responded by telling him she would accept the challenge and did her utmost to fulfill her promise but later he told her that she was not a good wife for [mr n] or [o]. she claimed that similarly because of how she treated them, they loved her and confided in her, especially [mr n] who she described as a sweet boy who sang songs to her. she asserted that she helped [mr n] with his school work. she said that [p] loved her step brothers especially [mr n] claiming that [p] put love notes under his door. she added that [o] liked to play with [p]’s microscope. nonetheless, [ms chosar] stated that the children had expected sibling issues claiming that [mr n] was the most powerful in the sibling group while [o] sometimes bossed [p]. in her affidavit sealed 16th december 2019, (paragraphs 79 and 80), [ms chosar] indicated that given [x]’s age at the time of the separation, she did not believe he had the opportunity to form a significant relationship with [mr n] and [o]. she added that she met with them separately since the separation so that they could spend time with [x]. ... [ms chosar] stated that she is afraid about possible consequences for [x] if any time he spends with [mr chosar] is not supervised. she said that [x] might not be returned to her, [mr chosar] may “bolt” with [x] or that he may be aggressive towards [x] if [x] is disobedient. she added that she also fears [mr chosar] might take his anger towards her out on [x].
... ...he was referred under a section 32 order to consult with [mr u] for treatment for a period of 6 months, however, he has been receiving personal counselling since december 2019 from [mr u]... [ms chosar] stated that prior to the separation she and [mr chosar] had been seeing their marriage counsellor, [ms bb]. she stated that she felt let down by the support she received in that engagement especially when [mr chosar] was threatening to have her admitted to a mental health facility and have the children taken from her. she asserted that she had been diagnosed with situational depression. [ms chosar] added that after the separation, she was referred to [ms cc] for trauma counselling through [dd services] due to the family violence she had experienced and has received ongoing support. she said that she has ongoing fears of [mr chosar] and through the counselling she has been encouraged to look at the small areas of happiness she has in her life. she stated however, that she is petrified of [mr chosar] and she cannot imagine a future free of worries because of the threat he poses to her.   chosar] stated that he and his ex-wife were unable to support each other or meet each other’s emotional needs after they lost their first child [...]. he stated that his eldest son, [mr n] was born [...] followed by the birth of [o] in 2005. he referred to a rapid deterioration in their marriage thereafter. he said that he assumed a significant care giving for his sons both prior to and after the amicable separation from his ex-wife in 2012. he stated that they continued to be good friends in the interests of their sons who continued to move fluidly between the household.

[ms chosar] said that initially [mr chosar] told her she was beautiful, pure and wonderful and that god had intervened to bring them into each other’s lives. she stated that even though they had separate residences, she was at his house “all of the time” and they were intimately involved. she stated that she did whatever he wanted including moving to [suburb f] in 2017 from her apartment in [suburb d] which she had rented in 2015, on his direction. ... [mr chosar] referred to [ms chosar] insisting on certain rituals around their wedding which to him seemed to be disingenuous. he said that, even though he had already proposed to [ms chosar], she wanted a story for facebook. he asserted that he and [ms chosar] had some differences in opinion about social media and one of their arguments was triggered by him not liking one of her facebook posts....
... from this assessment, there was no indicators to suggest that [mr chosar] is not currently providing an adequate level of care for [x] and is meeting his day to day needs. she appears to be doing that to a satisfactory level. [x] seemed to be reaching the milestones that would be expected for a child of his age. [ms chosar] has also enrolled [x] in day care... based on this assessment, there are no indicators to suggest that [ms chosar] should not currently continue as the primary care giving parent for [x]. [mr chosar] has had limited opportunity to take a role in the day to day care of [x] since the separation. he has confidence that he has no limitations and although he has been untested in this regard since the separation, he does have a track record of having been a single parent for his two older children. ... the parties currently have a negligible capacity to communicate and any communication seems to be occurring through their legal representatives. it is questionable given the high level of hostility and acrimony between them whether they will reach the point where they can communicate and make decisions collaboratively in [x]’s interests. they may find it beneficial to enrol in a parenting after separation course if they have not already done so and consider the services of [jj program] offered through [kk counsellors]. they are also advised to adopt parallel parenting where each of them makes the day to day decisions when [x] is in their care. a communication app such as my family wizard would be a timely introduction so that the parties can safely communicate in respect of [x]. ultimately, the court may be left no option but to grant parental responsibility to [ms chosar] but that would be marginalizing to [mr chosar]. it is imperative that final orders address the need for further litigation as the dispute could become intractable leaving [x] in a tug-o-war between his parents for the long term. despite their disdain for each other, [x] is a loved and treasured child by both parents and most likely by the network of significant adults and children from both his paternal and maternal families... for [x] to achieve optimal development he ideally requires to form strong and secure relationships with both parents and this is a crucial developmental milestone at this age, albeit that needs to occur in context where [x] is not at risk. the conditions for secure attachments to form when parents are separated are for the child to live with one parent and spend regular time, preferably weekly with the other... ... [x] has since orders were made in april 2020 spent time with [mr chosar] supervised by [h contact centre]. the interactions which were noted in those visits were consistent with those observed between [x] and his father in the context where they were seen together for the preparation of this report. there was nothing to suggest that [mr chosar] was inappropriate with [x] or that [x] was uneasy or afraid of his father. their interactions were consistently enthusiastic and engaging. ...the observations for this assessment suggest [x] enjoys a warm and loving relationship with his mother. one of the concerning dimensions in this matter that impacts on the parenting arrangements is the extent and nature of family violence. [ms chosar] made allegations that she was the victim of coercive and controlling physical, emotional and financial violence from [mr chosar] resulting in many incidents but culminating in the issue of a two year a.v.o. protecting her and [x]. she finds it difficult to separate her own experience of [mr chosar] from that of [x]... it would be helpful for [ms chosar] to use the therapeutic relationship to discuss her level of anxiety and how to address the fears that will likely arise for her, if unsupervised time was to be introduced... it was concerning that at the time of the incident [in mid] 2019, [mr chosar] minimized the seriousness of the violence. in addition, he alleged that [ms chosar] had, on occasions, been dysregulated in her interactions with him and the children. he was able to acknowledge the inappropriateness of his actions in the interviews for the preparation of this report although he did state that previous incidents that had been reported to the police did not warrant police attention... both parties have at times most likely allowed their emotional dysregulation to override their focus on parenting and they have behaved quite immaturely in the presence of [x] and the other children. given that the parties provide such discordant accounts, it may be for the court to determine the extent of family violence in this matter... ... ...the parties are at an impasse in their capacity to move forward as parents. if orders were to be made for unsupervised time, the changeover arrangements would require careful attention in the light of the high level of hypervigilance [ms chosar] feels she needs to exercise so that she does not come into contact with [mr chosar] or he does not become aware of details of her life. at present, that would seem to be highly triggering for [ms chosar]. until [x] commences school, the parties may need to consider changeover arrangements which involve a changeover service or a trusted other, maybe one of the older children, if they are unable to come into contact with each other. once [x] commences school, it would be recommended that the changeovers occur at the school.  phasis added)
can i turn to the mother’s proposal now, which is that [x]’s time with his father – effectively, you get to nothing beyond daytime only once a weekend and a little bit of time, day time only, in school holidays indefinitely. are you able to comment on whether there are any implications of that amount of time, and i’m going to describe it to you as a restricted amount of time, with his father for [x]? and, again, both short‑term and long-term if there are differences?---look, again, i think that’s minimal time. from what you’ve described in terms of the current contact reports and the ones i had viewed back two years ago, there certainly seems to be a sound and significant relationship between [x] and his father. and i guess relationship doesn’t form in a vacuum. and i would say that seriously limits [x]’s capacity to have the fullness of his father and sibling contact in his life. it also limits activities that [x] might be able to do with his father, exposure of his father to any of his wider life, such as his school. so i would say that it’s a bear minimum of a living arrangement regime that would facilitate the father-son relationship.
in your report at paragraph 108, you set out your recommendations for time arrangements between [x] and – in your report, in your recommendations, you set out the time that you say would be an appropriate way forward at paragraph 118. are you able to expand upon what you would consider to be the benefits of [x] having that type of time arrangement with his father?---well, i think, in terms of a child’s development, the active, visible and hands-on presence of both parents who can contribute to his care, his education, development of interests beyond his education is what we would hope that every child would be able to enjoy in separated and in non-separated families. and i guess my recommendation in terms of [x] spending substantial time with his father is – has, at its source, that motivation that [x] identity is contributed to by both of his parents and that – that he observes them – observes each of them having an input into his – the totality of his emotional, physical, cognitive and psychological development. and through – in the father’s home, [x] has two half-siblings. are you able to expand upon the benefit that the time arrangement that you propose might have for [x] if he was to spend time with his two half-siblings?---well – well, certainly, a sibling relationship – even though, i believe, the siblings are considerably older than – than [x] – is again part of – of a child – padding out where he belongs in – in a family system, and – and, certainly, sibling relationships fall – well, for many children, become the – the – the next generation contact. that certainly is extremely important for a child feeling part of – of a very special group in their lives called “family”. so i – i can’t emphasise enough the – the importance of [x] having opportunities to – to consolidate those – those sibling relationships through arrangements that allow him to – to spend substantial time in – in the father’s household.
relevant legal principles
the best interests of the children
section 60cc considerations a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents: a primary consideration ] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant. in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92 at [121] the full court accepted as appropriate this interpretation by brown j of “meaningful relationship”.  b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence: a primary consideration  in early 2018, during a verbal argument, the father had grabbed the mother’s wrist causing her pain and pushed her, the mother had sent a text message to members of the father’s family in this regard, (b) in mid-2019 the parties were having an argument during which the father twisted the mother’s arm which caused it to ache. at this time the mother sent a text message to the parties’ parish priest referring to this event. (c) in mid-2019 the mother had gone into mr n’s room to talk to him and the father was in there, and the father told the mother to get out and pushed her by the arm causing pain and a later bruise. a copy photograph of the bruise on the mother’s arm is shown in exhibit b. (d) in mid-2019 the parties had a verbal argument relating to one of the father’s sons. the police had viewed footage from the cctv camera in relation to this incident. at one point the father was standing close to the mother with his right hand raised as if he was going to strike her. during the argument the father pushed the mother from behind whilst she was holding the child. at one point he had held his hand over the mother’s mouth to stop her from screaming. neighbours of the parties had called the police who attended and arrested the father. he was charged, inter alia, with common assault (dv). the father pleaded guilty. he lodged a severity appeal, in relation to, inter alia, the conviction, and the district court of nsw upheld the appeal and made a variation order under section 32 of the mental health act 2007 (nsw).   in mid-2019 the parties were having an argument during which the father twisted the mother’s arm which caused it to ache. at this time the mother sent a text message to the parties’ parish priest referring to this event.

i must start with an apology, one that i failed to express in any other way... so please imagine you are being hugged by god himself as i pray only he can express how much i want to atone for the hurt i have caused you by my rude words, my pride and lack of understanding of what it is you need and being able to give you that without prejudice... in the last few months i have come to learn a lot about myself, but in recent weeks a lot about why you feel the way you do and i wish i had known this earlier...   the father received personal counselling from psychologist mr u since december 2019. at trial the father stated that his treatment with mr u was completed one year ago. (c) the father completed two courses, neither of which had been court ordered. that included a six-week q program course with r counsellors in late 2019 which covered topics such as managing emotions, identifying abuse, healthy lifestyle, social skills practice, family, friends and community and action planning. the father has also completed an s program with aa counsellors having been evaluated to do that course. (d) the family report writer had stated at paragraph 111 of her report that the above courses and psychological therapy “would have had at the core, assisting (the father) explore any propensity for dysregulated behaviour and acquiring more appropriate strategies to deal with his emotions.” (e) the father stated to the family report writer, in relation to the incident in mid-2019, that he accepted and acknowledged he made poor choices on the day and referred to the inappropriateness of his actions (see paragraphs 23 and 111 of the family report). (f) during the father’s cross-examination he agreed that his conduct during the incident in mid-2019 was intimidating (towards the mother) and that the mother was fearful of him by reason of this incident. he agreed that his behaviour would have scared the child. (g) the father has agreed to a final parenting order that the mother have sole parental responsibility for the child, such agreement by the father probably at least represents an acknowledgement by him that the parties would prospectively be unlikely to be able to reach agreement on major decisions affecting the child in a timely fashion and without conflict, and that such conflict would not be in the best interests of the child.   the father completed two courses, neither of which had been court ordered. that included a six-week q program course with r counsellors in late 2019 which covered topics such as managing emotions, identifying abuse, healthy lifestyle, social skills practice, family, friends and community and action planning. the father has also completed an s program with aa counsellors having been evaluated to do that course.

(b) apart from exposing the child to possible harm in the incident in mid-2019, there is no significant evidence that the child has been emotionally or physically harmed by the father prior to mid-2019 or since that time. the family report writer observed, having referred to the father’s supervised time with the father and the positive observation sessions for the family report, that there was nothing to suggest that the father was inappropriate with the child or that the child was uneasy or afraid of the father (see paragraph 105 of the family report). (c) the court, again, does not accept that the father has perpetrated significant family violence (including coercive and controlling family violence) against his own sons or the mother’s daughter. (d) the father has historically provided significant positive parenting care for his own sons who have personally developed well (the mother conceding that they are good persons) and who are doing well at school. the family report writer had referred to these matters at paragraph 96 of the family report. the father has an amicable relationship with his former wife being the mother of his two sons. (e) there is no evidence that the father historically used the cctv cameras within the home to monitor and control his sons mr n and o or p. the court refers to its findings above in relation to the father’s use of cctv cameras within the home. (f) again, the found family violence of the father arose significantly in the context of ongoing situational conflict with the mother and, again, in circumstances where the father was likely suffering significant anxiety. again, the father has, post separation, obtained counselling from a psychologist. there is no evidence that the father presently has a new partner. the father lives with his two sons. (g) the court’s proposed orders as discussed above under the meaningful relationship primary consideration embrace a gradual build-up of time, including overnight time, between the child and the father, thus affording the child and the mother appropriate time to become emotionally comfortable with having such time with the father. during such a gradual build-up of time, the mother, if necessary, can utilise her present supports (e.g. the w program) to manage any anxiety experienced by her in relation to such time between the child and the father. the father will have time to reflect upon these reasons including the court’s findings relating to family violence. the court is also of the view that limiting the child’s overnight time with the father, during school term times from the commencement of term 1 in 2025, to three nights each fortnight (after school friday to before school monday) and not permitting mid-week overnight time in the off week (as proposed by the icl and father) will lessen the extent to which the parties will need to co-parent the child and thereby lessen the risk of conflict between them to which the child might be exposed, and also contribute to assisting the mother to manage any anxiety she may experience. (h) changeovers should occur in a public place as proposed by the parties (b store at suburb d) which should contribute to minimisation of conflict and lessening of any anxiety in the mother. (i) whilst the father has probably not provided parenting for a child of the child’s age for some time, noting the age of the father’s two sons now, the court’s proposed gradual build-up of time between the child and the father will afford the father an opportunity to redevelop his parenting skills in this regard. (j) the child’s supervised time with the father to date has been positive and there currently exists a meaningful relationship between the child and the father which is ripe for further development. this view is supported by the family report writer’s positive observations of the child and the father at the family report interviews. (k) the father, should the child spend time with him pursuant to the court’s proposed final parenting orders as discussed above under the meaningful relationship primary consideration, should be restrained from: (i) denigrating the mother or a member of her family in the presence of or hearing of the child, (ii) using physical discipline towards the child, or (iii) discussing these proceedings in the hearing or presence of the child. (l) the court does not accept that there is a significantly greater theoretical risk of the father denigrating the mother during any overnight time spent with the child compared to spending a fortnightly full day with the child during school term time (as proposed by the mother). (m) the court does not accept that there is a significant risk that the father will use the cctv cameras within the home to monitor and control the child should the court make orders as discussed under the meaningful relationship primary consideration.   apart from exposing the child to possible harm in the incident in mid-2019, there is no significant evidence that the child has been emotionally or physically harmed by the father prior to mid-2019 or since that time. the family report writer observed, having referred to the father’s supervised time with the father and the positive observation sessions for the family report, that there was nothing to suggest that the father was inappropriate with the child or that the child was uneasy or afraid of the father (see paragraph 105 of the family report).

(m) the court does not accept that there is a significant risk that the father will use the cctv cameras within the home to monitor and control the child should the court make orders as discussed under the meaningful relationship primary consideration.   the father has historically provided significant positive parenting care for his own sons who have personally developed well (the mother conceding that they are good persons) and who are doing well at school. the family report writer had referred to these matters at paragraph 96 of the family report. the father has an amicable relationship with his former wife being the mother of his two sons. (e) there is no evidence that the father historically used the cctv cameras within the home to monitor and control his sons mr n and o or p. the court refers to its findings above in relation to the father’s use of cctv cameras within the home. (f) again, the found family violence of the father arose significantly in the context of ongoing situational conflict with the mother and, again, in circumstances where the father was likely suffering significant anxiety. again, the father has, post separation, obtained counselling from a psychologist. there is no evidence that the father presently has a new partner. the father lives with his two sons. (g) the court’s proposed orders as discussed above under the meaningful relationship primary consideration embrace a gradual build-up of time, including overnight time, between the child and the father, thus affording the child and the mother appropriate time to become emotionally comfortable with having such time with the father. during such a gradual build-up of time, the mother, if necessary, can utilise her present supports (e.g. the w program) to manage any anxiety experienced by her in relation to such time between the child and the father. the father will have time to reflect upon these reasons including the court’s findings relating to family violence. the court is also of the view that limiting the child’s overnight time with the father, during school term times from the commencement of term 1 in 2025, to three nights each fortnight (after school friday to before school monday) and not permitting mid-week overnight time in the off week (as proposed by the icl and father) will lessen the extent to which the parties will need to co-parent the child and thereby lessen the risk of conflict between them to which the child might be exposed, and also contribute to assisting the mother to manage any anxiety she may experience. (h) changeovers should occur in a public place as proposed by the parties (b store at suburb d) which should contribute to minimisation of conflict and lessening of any anxiety in the mother. (i) whilst the father has probably not provided parenting for a child of the child’s age for some time, noting the age of the father’s two sons now, the court’s proposed gradual build-up of time between the child and the father will afford the father an opportunity to redevelop his parenting skills in this regard. (j) the child’s supervised time with the father to date has been positive and there currently exists a meaningful relationship between the child and the father which is ripe for further development. this view is supported by the family report writer’s positive observations of the child and the father at the family report interviews.
