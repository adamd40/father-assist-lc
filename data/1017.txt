the law
balance sheet
we consider that generally speaking a person can give some evidence by way of admission as to the value of real estate owned by them which can be accorded weight notwithstanding such weight might be very much less than the weight given to that of a professional valuer, for example. the ordinary common experience of people is that where they own only a few significant assets, such as cars and houses, they are well aware of the purchase price and have some knowledge obtained from a variety of sources about their value.
