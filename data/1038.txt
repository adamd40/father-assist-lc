the children are young and were not formally interviewed. [x] was a bright little girl who easily settled into playroom with the other children. [y] (sic) was an adorable baby, very placid who also easily settled into the playroom. the mother spent time with the children in the playroom. there were no formal observations as such and the mother was able to spend 30 minutes or thereabout with the children. she seemed to focus her attentions on [y] (sic) and consistent with her reports during interview that she missed him, she stayed in close proximity with him. [x] was observed to become upset upon her mother’s departure telling her she did not want her to go. [x] seemed easily distracted and settle quickly after her mother’s departure. the children happily went to their father and grandparents and left without distress.[2]
this is a difficult matter. the children have a bond with the mother and the present circumstances makes this difficult to maintain. however, given the reports from the parents and the information form dhhs which appears to corroborate child safety qld’s concerns, there have been a number of concerns about the children in the care of the mother. the children have been removed from her care. there seems the children need to remain in the father’s care with the support of the paternal family in the interim whilst further information can be gathered and further assessment can take place. the primary issues the parties may need to address immediately is how the children’s time with the mother can be facilitated. [3]
when [x] entered the reception area and saw [ms cobb], she ran to her, calling her [ms cobb], and gave her a cuddle. she seemed very excited to see [ms cobb]. however, once [x] realised that [mr landry] and [ms g] had left, she refused to enter the observation room with [ms cobb], despite [ms cobb]’s best efforts to encourage and cajole her. [ms l] was asked to assist. with her encouragement, [x] entered the observation room with [ms cobb]. however, upon entering, she sat alone and initially refused to engage with [ms cobb]. with much encouragement, [x] then moved to sit with [ms cobb] and [y] (sic) on the couch. she allowed [ms cobb] to read her a story. at the end of the story, the children found some toys to play with. [x] appeared to be competing for [ms cobb]’s attention whenever [ms cobb] was focussed on [y]. [ms cobb] then encouraged [x] to play with [y]. [x] began throwing blocks around the room and singing very loudly. [ms cobb] did not appear to know how to address those behaviours. [x] then let herself out of the room and refused to re-enter. [y] appeared to be happy to sit and interact with [ms cobb] throughout as well as engage in independent play.[4]
the reality appears to be that [x]’s relationship with [ms cobb] has been severely impacted by her experiences to date, to the extent that she overtly objects to spending time with [ms cobb], even with the support of [ms l]. this is not surprising given the understanding that [ms cobb]’s addiction progressively became worse from the time she fell pregnant with [x]. as such, [x]’s experience of [ms cobb] would have been that her mother was emotionally, and at times physically, unavailable, leaving [x] to feel unsafe during her early developmental years.[5]   cobb] indicated that she would consider relocating to adelaide if required and would make every effort to ensure she accessed appropriate supports, both professional and social, if she did so. it may be that the only way for her to re-establish a meaningful relationship with [x] and [y] would be to do so.[6]
family dispute resolution and make a genuine effort to reach an agreement as to the progression of the children’s time with their mother.
failing such agreement the orders envisaged that ms cobb would be able to make a further application to the court to spend time with the children.
events since orders of february 2020
3.15pm: [ms cobb] entered the playroom and exclaimed, "where are they?" and acted surprised when the children jumped out. they all laughed and the children then took out some toys and sat on the floor and began to play. [ms cobb] divided her time between both children. [ms cobb] shared with the worker how [x] came second in her race at sports day. [ms cobb] then talked to the children about going to sports day and seeing [y] in the pusher. she then said, "i am so happy to see you today. i love coming to see you," and smiled at the children who looked at her and smiled back. 3.45pm: [ms cobb] suggested they go outside and they moved to the mud kitchen. [ms cobb] gave [x] some sand and water to mix, who pretended it was a cafe and began to make [ms cobb] food. [y] played independently riding on the cars and [ms cobb] divided her attention between them both. [x] called out to [ms cobb], "come and get your latte," and [y] called to [ms cobb] and said, "i want you." [ms cobb] promised to come back and continued to move between both children. 4pm: outdoor play continued with [ms cobb] sharing her time between [x] in the mud kitchen and [y] on the ride on cars. conversation was focused on play and [ms cobb] also spoke about seeing the children at sports day. she also spoke about how she loved bringing things into do with the children and playing with them. play outside continued until the end of the visit. 4.15pm: the supervisor announced the visit had finished and [x] said, "i don't want to go." [ms cobb] encouraged [y] to give her a hug which he did. [ms cobb] reassured [x] she could play with the sand mixture next time. they all moved back into the playroom. [ms cobb] gave [y] a balloon and she then hugged the children who then left with the supervisor. visit ended.
when [ms cobb] was told by the supervisor that the children didn't want to stay, she broke down and began to cry. [ms cobb] spoke about the long hard road it had been to see her children and her determination to do the right thing. [ms cobb] said she thought [mr landry] and [ms g] were not supporting her or encouraging the children to see her. [ms cobb] talked about the grief she feels not seeing her children and is determined to do whatever she needs to have them in her life [ms cobb] thanked the supervisor and worker and left.
the father and his partner sought advice from the therapist about how they could promote a positive and connected relationship between the mother, the subject children, and their half-siblings. they expressed concern regarding the current arrangement and dynamic regarding the subject children spending time with their mother and half-siblings as they had noticed behaviour in [x] which indicated that contact with the mother and the half siblings were traumatising to her. the father's partner described regressed behaviours in [x], prior and post, spending time with her mother. they described that [x] wets the bed and has nightmares which they believe is connected to her spending time with the mother.[8]
unfortunately, the recommendations made by the therapist were not followed by the mother. the mother conveyed to the therapist that she was unable to follow through on the suggestions made during the therapist's involvement. the mother indicated that her mental health was impacting on her capacity to implement the strategies necessary to repair and strengthen the relationship between her and her younger two children. as a result, the mother was wanting to meet with the father and his partner again to further discuss moving forward with her relationship with her children and develop different agreements which were more achievable for the mother. however, the father and his partner expressed concern about further committing to therapy given the lack of follow through by the mother. the father's partner was clear that the father and her (sic) needed to see consistency and effort by the mother, as without this, they were concerned about the impact sporadic contact will have on the subject children's psychological wellbeing. furthermore, they expressed a lack of faith in the mother's ongoing commitment to the subject children given her lack of consistency and ability to follow through on the therapist's recommendations.[9]
from july 2021 to january 2022, i tried asking the father for family contact with the children, even by telephone, but my requests were denied. the father had stated that i would need to send video messages to the children as prerequisites for access to the children, as per recommendations of [ms p]. the father did not facilitate any phone calls or video calls during this period.[10]
the hearing on 4 july 2023 & the nature of an interim hearing
legal principles relating to parenting proceedings  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[16]
the rule in rice & asplund hen the threshold question described in rice and asplund is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination ‘on the merits’. where an application is dismissed at a preliminary stage, it is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of a party to appear or some lack of compliance with form and procedure but rather because, assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an insufficient change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing. though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child’s welfare than to allow the application to continue.[26]
nevertheless, there are significant changes that occur which do require a court to reconsider decisions previously made. whether in a particular case a court should be willing to embark upon another hearing concerning the child and parent, or whether to do so would itself be demonstrably contrary to the best interests of the child, is a decision to be made in each particular case. how is that decision to be made? the court must look at: (1) the past circumstances, including the reasons for the decision and the evidence upon which it was based. (2) whether there is a likelihood of orders being varied in a significant way, as a result of a new hearing. (3) if there is such a likelihood, the nature of the likely changes must be weighed against the potential detriment to the child or children caused by the litigation itself. thus, for example, small changes may not have sufficient benefit to compensate for the disruption caused by significant re-litigation.
where the question of whether a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred is to be determined as a matter preliminary to the hearing of the application, it is accepted that the applicant’s evidence should be taken at its highest.[31]
the power to order summary judgment must be exercised with exceptional caution ... and should never be exercised unless it is clear that there is no real question to be tried.[34]
discussion hat is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents’ proposals embraced in competing applications involve again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children’s best interests.[36]
