evidentiary matters
statutory framework
primary considerations
the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents
without intervention, i am very concerned that [ms peake] is on a path to estrangement from the children and she clearly is a mother who cares deeply for the children, no matter her difficulties with managing that.[19]
the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to their views
in respect to his views and wishes about future parenting arrangements, [y] expressed that he liked it how things are. he however spoke of wanting to spend school holiday time with [mr cousins] rather than [ms peake] as he liked being at his father’s home more. [y] reported that he believed his mother would be upset with his wishes and she wanted to do ‘fifty fifty.’ at this point in the interview, [y] continued to present upset and tearful therefore the writer made a decision to end the interview.[28]
the nature of the children’s relationships with each of their parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the children to spend time with them, and to communicate with them
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of any changes in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the children of any separation from either of their parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom the children have been living
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect their right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the children’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of the children, to provide for the needs of the children, including emotional and intellectual needs  peake] suffers from periods of increased distress with evidence of depression which best fit the pattern of [a mental condition]. ... it may be that the stress of the issues relating to [mr cousins] have caused distress and impairment in functioning as part of her [mental condition], or, less likely, another disorder such as a [mental illness] is emerging. i believe that the concerns warrant follow-up by a psychiatrist to do further longitudinal assessment to either be confident that a [mental illness] is not present or emerging, or to treat such a disorder if evident. i would envisage that monitoring and review over a 6-month period would help clarify the issue. ... also of concern is [ms peake]'s repeated contacted with [mr cousins] which in my opinion reflects being overly emotionally invested in the relationship despite the separation and i believe that her psychological input, which should continue, should address this because i believe that this significant level of conflict has potential to impact on the care of the children either directly or indirectly.[33]
there were no clear delusions evident, although she exhibited paranoia about the process, including beliefs that the conduct of the independent children's lawyer and the senior judicial registrar was racist and biased towards her.[34] ... as per my previous report, i believe that [ms peake] suffers from personality vulnerabilities. in my opinion, she has demonstrated, in her conduct of this matter, [mental health issues], although a diagnosis of [mental health issues] per se would require a longer period of longitudinal assessment, and i repeat my earlier recommendation that she should have some further assessment by a psychiatrist to determine whether there is indeed an underlying [mental] disorder. .... she has, in my opinion previously suffered from [a mental illness], and in my opinion there is a degree of ongoing anxiety related to the court matters.[35]
... i have no doubt that her personality vulnerabilities are having a detrimental effect on her parenting and her ability to conduct the current proceedings. ... her correspondence with the children attached in the affidavit material reveals an inability to shield them from conflict with her father and indicates a degree of emotional harm by her comments towards them. in my opinion, this reflects her inability to manage the process and contain her distress and behaviour. ... she has evidenced an inability to emotional separate from [mr peake] (sic) and the court proceedings.[36]
psychological input, in my opinion, is critical and should provide further assessment of personality and intervention to encourage her to manage any concerns about the children in an appropriate way, focus on improving her communication with the children, including, importantly, not discussing their father with them. i recognise that it is going to be difficult for [ms peake] to read and consider the recommendations of this report and engage in this treatment as she lacks insight into the nature and impact of her behaviour, but it is critical to her health and the wellbeing of the children.[37] (emphasis added)
in my opinion, [ms peake] needs to be able to demonstrate, with intervention, that she is able to work positively in the co-parenting relationship and stop her voluminous communications and her repeated and protracted legal manoeuvres. without intervention, i am very concerned that [ms peake] is on a path to estrangement from the children and she clearly is a mother who cares deeply for the children, no matter her difficulties with managing that.[40]
dear [x], actually, we had discussed last weekend that, due to your escalating aggressive and disrespectful attitude and behaviour towards me, i will have to set firm boundaries for you as your parent, whereby you will need to respectfully advise me with reasonable advance notice, of your intention to either call and/or spend time with me. i can then either approve or disallow it. i do not want [y] to be continually affected by your enabled poor attitude and behaviour and also often, i would have to book activities or trips well in advance for the weekends. hence i do not want to continue to reward coercive control or abusive behaviour from my own child. since it is thursday evening, and it was discussed that you would need to provide to me reasonable notice by wednesday evening at the very latest, and no advanced notice had been received from you as a courtesy and respect, to seek my permission to spend time for this weekend, i had simply presumed it was a given that [y] and i would spend quality time on our advanced planned activities. we had also discussed that if you want to seriously repair our relationship without the constant threats, blame or vitriol or false allegations, as what [ms u] stated during our last session that "you are simply the mouth piece", with ongoing counselling with [ms u], then it is for you to call her to make further appointments (i have provided to you her buisness card and details). i had also discussed with you on how you would propose to contribute towards the high out of pocket costs (after medicare rebates from your medicare mental health plan) for the sessions (approximately $120 per hour after medicare rebate). i had proposed to you that one way for you to contribute would be to earn pocket money through chores and the monetary value that you would placed on certain types of chores. we discussed last weekend that within a healthy relationship, there needs to be two people who are willing to compromise with forgiveness on both sides. you cannot threaten or force anyone else to want to have a relationship with you. [ms u] pointed out to you that you have been overly exposed to adult issues and have become the mouth piece and that it should be easy for me to forgive you if i continue to remember that you are only the mouth piece. i love you unconditionally and with all my heart. i have always sacrificed and did my utmost best for you and [y], by fighting to get you into [r school]. i fully appreciate and understand that as a teenager, you want to push back with your own identity and are entering a rebellious phase. but i also can identify the insidious nature of coercive control and learnt behaviour that perpetuate that vicious cycle, from which i left many years ago. hence, sweetie, my firm boundaries will remain for you as were discussed. there is no need to send me further emails to advise that you are not wanting to spend time. as per our discussion, please only send mum in advance your intentions if and when you wish to call me or spend time with me. i will either confirm or deny permission. please give the shared phone to [y] to be in charged of going forward, and please do not hold the phone to ransom to restrict my relationship, with your brother. please also keep adult issues that you are being told inappropriately away from [y]. my ongoing relationship with you is different and separate from my ongoing relationship with [y]. i love with you all my heart. mum.[41] (emphasis added)
it is too emotionally traumatic for you to have emotional tantrums in public in the parking lot of mcdonald’s. it also feeds into your egocentric need to be the focus of attention, to feel entitled and to learn behaviour of coercive control.[42]
ms peake objected to this passage being read on the basis that it was “argumentative”. ironically, it was her own words to x that were being quoted to her that she then claimed to be argumentative. i reject her evidence that she was not attacking and criticising her son by email.
so rather that traumatise you further, it is these difficult decisions that mum would have to make when i file my amended final orders for trial in november 2022, to ensure you are no longer used, and to give you a reprieve, from being further abused by your dad for his court case.[43]
not only is that passage remarkable for its direct exposure of x to the proceedings, it also makes the false allegation that the extant court proceedings were mr cousins’ case, rather than the one initiated by ms peake. it also alleges mr cousins of abusing x. x was then in mr cousins’ care as a result of orders to which ms peake consented in december 2019. contrary to ms peake’s evidence, i find her email to be an attempt to poison x’s mind about mr cousins.
it is not because i love you less than [y] or have "abandoned" you when you see that i am spending thousands to fight only for [y] now and not for you in 2019. i have done my very best for you. there are other children who may need me more as well.[44]
well, i’ve had it with you, son. there are other kids i’m going to give my time to. they need me more than you.
your behaviour and action during the past few months have gone against all of our tradition, values, and cultural and family upbringing and it has been a dishonour to your grandparents' memory and sacrifices.[45]
x’s maternal grandparents have passed away. ms peake conceded that the comment was hard hitting. i accept counsel for mr cousins’ characterisation of the email as being a very heavy statement for x to wear.   peake]: i'm not happy at all [y]: i can get it back [ms peake]: so you r at [mr cousins’] without your watch ?? [ms peake]: it is very expensive [ms peake]: i do not trust you with anything anymore [y]: :( [ms peake]: i asked you not to brag or show anyone [ms peake]: not even [mr cousins] [y]: i didn't [ms peake]: you disobeyed me over and over [ms peake]: you showed the kids [ms peake]: none of their business [ms peake]: i bought it for your safety [ms peake]: not a play thing [y]: they found out them selfs [ms peake]: just like you are stuck at your dad due to your actions [y]: i didn't play on it [ms peake]: you will need to learn the consequence   peake]: pls ask [v] to take from you and i will confiscate permanent [ms peake]: permanently [ms peake]: you will need to start to learn consequences [y]: including [z] [ms peake]: too easy with me all your life [ms peake]: no [ms peake]: just the watch [ms peake]: then you are on your own [ms peake]: let [mr cousins] take care of you and your future [ms peake]: you're one of 5 [y] [ms peake]: roll with the flow [ms peake]: i wand your watch to be return to me next week [ms peake]: permanently [y]: okay [ms peake]: where is it now? [ms peake]: you think that you will get angry at me [y]? [ms peake]: i might disown you before then! i am very disappointed   peake]: and yet when i ask you to do things and say things to [aa] for your own future you said the opposite [ms peake]: go with the flow !! [ms peake]: no use crying to me now [ms peake]: you continue to not listen [ms peake]: like the watch [ms peake]: i spent lots of money to make sure that watch keeps you safe [ms peake]: you do not appreciate anything or my effort [ms peake]: well then [y] enjoy trips to [the shops] and be given crumbs [ms peake]: my efforts have been wasted  : how do you change [y]: like [y]: be gratful [y]: because i wish i could change [y]: yes you may think that i am being sorry to myself [ms peake]: when you go hungry and thirsty [ms peake]: and not loved [ms peake]: when no one is there for you when you need someone [ms peake]: then you will realise what you have lost [y]: i did a serious conversation with [x] [y]: i lost everything [y]: including myself [y]: about me wanting to kill myself [y]: i just wish i could change [ms peake]: stop watching your inappropriate you tube videos [ms peake]: and playing your computer games [y]: i also told [x] want to do if i wanted to chang [y]: *change [y]: but, mummy, how do i change [y]: how do i be grateful and not a spoiled brat who cares about nothing [y]: or a b###### [y]: it's hard [y]: i'm bad [ms peake]: firstly stop being a drama king   peake]: this is real life ... [ms peake]: you don’t get do overs .... [ms peake]: you didn’t care who you live with [ms peake]: you said so yourself .... [ms peake]: stop feeling sorry for yourself [ms peake]: own your consequences   peake]: you are not bad [ms peake]: there are kids worse off than you [ms peake]: kids homeless hungry unloved [ms peake]: you need to go and talk to [mr cousins] and voice what you need [ms peake]: both of you
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of their parents, and any other relevant characteristics of the children
if the children are aboriginal children or torres strait islander children, their right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to the children, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of their parents
during 2019, i had also discussed with you that mum had to rebuild our future and to pave your path to financial security and tertiary education to prevent a repeat of your "homelessness" at having to play camping while you slept in a tent (you do remember all those times dont you [x]). i have previously told you that my position will pave your path easier into certain university courses.[48]
ms peake gave oral evidence that it was totally inappropriate for her to raise a period of homelessness with x in the manner she did. more concerning was her subsequent evidence that “i could have stopped myself”. so much indicates that she was not reacting or overreacting in that moment, rather, making a considered decision to raise a wholly inappropriate topic in her correspondence with her son. so much also reflects very poorly on her attitude to the responsibilities of parenthood, as does her repeated messaging to the children in relation to the court proceedings.
i say the family consultant did not have the benefit of my trial affidavit evidence. hence, she was only able to use inaccurate facts and false allegations. she did not assess in depth of severe consequences of family violence, parental alienation, and psychological abuse of the children while in [mr cousins]’s care. the email to [x] that have been used by [mr cousins] and relied upon by the family consultant was a part of a longer correspondence that she had not been privy to make a completer and more accurate conclusion.[49]
as ms peake acknowledged in oral evidence, it was entirely her fault that ms j did not have her affidavit evidence. her expressed apologies both to ms j and to the court do nothing to assuage the court of the view that ms peake’s failure to comply with its orders, directed to ensuring the best possible decision can be made in the children’s best interests, reflects poorly on her capacity to prioritise and attend to those interests.
on or around may 2022, by telephone when [ms u] called in relation to [y]’s birthday week on behalf of [mr cousins] and ms ham, icl, she attempted to exhort higher payments from me for what she deemed “favourable” clinical notes. i refused.[50]
she agreed in oral evidence that she was accusing ms u of being an extortionist. it is a scandalous allegation. ms peake subpoenaed ms u to give evidence but then chose not to call her to put the allegation to her. i do not accept ms peake’s evidence that ms u is an extortionist.
... there are substantial concerns that [ms peake]'s apparent persistent confrontations and threatened actions against other professionals that are directly involved in the children’s daily lives has and will have a detrimental impact upon them and their needs. the volume of material identified particularly in regards to the communication with the children’s schools may be viewed to be verging on harassment. it also takes up a considerable amount of the schools time which effectively is taken away from a focus upon the children’s needs. whilst [ms peake] may believe that she is undertaking her parenting role in advocating for the children and their needs there are significant concerns that if both parents are required to make decisions that pertain to the children, [ms peake]'s pattern of behaviour towards these professionals will likely severely disrupt any future intervention in regards to the children and their well-being. it is suggested that any orders that are made particularly in respect to future psychological support for the children that this will need to restrict [ms peake]'s capacity to communicate with such services.[52]
any family violence involving the children or a member of their family
counsel for [mr cousins]: .... it makes no sense that you, who loves her children, who would throw herself on hot coals to protect her children, correct? [ms peake]: yes counsel for [mr cousins]: yes, who would put her children before everyone else, correct? [ms peake]: yes counsel for [mr cousins]: yes, first priority, it just makes no sense whatsoever? [ms peake]: i saw their suffering. counsel for [mr cousins]: let me finish the question. it just makes no sense whatsoever that these allegations could be true, because if they were true, you would be like a fierce lion, fighting for them no matter what, [mr cousins] would be the last person you would ever agree to leave the children with, and the last person you would ever agree to give sole parental responsibility to, that’s the truth, isn’t it? [ms peake]: yes
because i haven’t been able to cross-examine [mr cousins] on any of his allegations and i’ve been hampered to present my case as effectively and i want to be able to – just like in 2019, so that – remove myself as much as possible. so that it’s – they don’t observe it any longer. if he feels – it has always been a competition of [mr cousins] having to win at everything, of controlling and having to win everything. if he feels like he has won this, perhaps the children won’t be exposed to it anymore.
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the children or a member of their family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the children
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility

...having heard and determined this multi-faceted dispute, it is evident to me that the mother is obsessive about issues that should have been resolved a long time ago and vindictive towards the father. she described her pathway as “seeking justice”, but in reality, she wastes an enormous amount of time which the courts have to provide, but they do so at the expense and delay to other litigants. the judges next hearing the foreshadowed proceedings (including the full court proceedings) might contemplate the use of s 102qb(3) of the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”) to stop this waste of court time. the parenting and associated dispute has to be seen in the context of final parenting orders that the parties consented to, and requested the federal circuit court to make, on 13 october 2015. the finality of those orders did not last long. since 2015, and particularly in 2018, there have been a number of hearings, most of which feature in these reasons. a fair reading of the judgments shows that the mother is at best misguided and, at worst, obsessive to the point of malevolence.[74]
current parenting proceedings
contempt applications
in addition to the parenting dispute that culminated in the orders of 13 october 2015, there have also been proceedings in the federal circuit court in relation to child support issues and an appeal by the mother against orders made in that court. the full court dismissed the mothers appeal. the mother recently sought to “re-open” the child support issue in the full court. strickland j dismissed her application on 3 december 2018. the mother had then lodged a contempt application against the father in this court which relates to his lack of discovery and “perjury” in the federal circuit court. that application should have been in the federal circuit court if it had some prospect of success. the supporting material i have read shows little apparent prospect having regard to the authorities in respect of contempt. the mother withdrew the contempt application only to indicate she will re-issue it in the federal circuit court.[81] (emphasis added, footnotes omitted)

this honourable court has unreasonably delayed my access to justice by delaying the setting of a trial date for the original contempt applications. it has denied my human rights to be judged by a fair, impartial and competent court. justice is never stale. this honourable court has turned a blind eye to wilful disobedience of its authority and erosion of public confidence with its bias and prejudice, despite multiple royal commissions and law reforms. my children will be adults in a very short time, yet my association with this honourable court may continue for many years if i choose to work in its jurisdiction. hence it is my duty to agitate for continual change for the best interests of other children who may come before this honourable court. the contempt applications are also to agitate for change in this honourable court, especially in relation to statutory obligations of the icl and as a court officer under her legal board registration to not mislead the court and to comply with her statutory obligations. i understand that my intention to prosecute the contempt applications will delay the parenting proceedings.[85] (emphasis added)
for the parents who are going through high conflict custody battles, [ms peake] is more than happy to render free advice on her own experience and on how to draft affidavits, file subpoenas and applications and most importantly share strategies and tactic....[86]
contravention application
vcat proceedings regarding dr g
on or around february 2023, [dr g] of [bb centre] was consulted by ms kristy ham of southern family law as the independent children's lawyer, to accept the brief to be the expert witness under rules 7 (1) of the family law rules 2021, for final trial on 17 - 19 july 2023 in the the [sic] family law proceeding mlc4941 /2014 [cousins] v [peake]. [dr g] accepted the brief with its full legal and statutory obligation as the expert witness to attend final trial for the intention of cross examination. however, subsequent to the acceptance of the brief and full payment, [dr g] proceeded to organise to be absent from australia for the entire month of july 2023 with wilful intent to breach the contract of service and/or allegedly fraudulently accepted the brief fully knowing in advance that he would be absent from australia and this would not be able to fulfill his legal and statutory obligations to attend final trial as the expert witness at final trial on 17 - 19 july 2023.[89] (emphasis added)
the court file itself indicates the problematic nature of the parties relationship in that there are over 170 documents contained in a box, all relating to hearings which number somewhere between 15 and 20 over the space of three years.[90]
i raised [x] and his brother [y] by myself as a single mother until 2020. we had final court parenting orders in 2015 (attached below) and the boys lived with me full time. the consent court orders of 2019 is very new and fresh due to our need for me to rebuild quicker for the boys' future financial security after protracted family court litigation initially for custody when the boys were so young ([x] 5 and [y] 3) and then recently to relocate them to the usa with me. we see it as as interim until [x] and [y] can decide for themselves as the court did not listen to their expressed wishes during the proceeding.[93] (as per original, emphasis added)
.... for the majority of their childhood, the children have experienced significant parental discord and lengthy conflict between the parents. long term exposure to parental conflict may contribute to the long term impact upon the children’s emotional and psychological well-being as they continue through their adolescences and into adulthood. this can be shown through an increased risk to their educational attainment, ability to socialise with others as well as their own mental health. both parents have identified that the children are already displaying signs of anxiety and whilst this may be caused by various reasons, in part it is likely as a result of the ongoing parental conflict and litigation. [y]’s presentation during his interview was concerning with a sense that he did not wish to talk about the current family dynamics and [x]’s own recognition of socialisation difficulties may both indications of such impacts.[95]
