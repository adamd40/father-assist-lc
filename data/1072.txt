oral application to adduce without prejudice communication
the father’s evidence
the mother’s evidence
legal principles  that person believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and person to spend time together with was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including that person or the child), and (b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).[18]   the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).[18]   necessary to protect the health or safety of the child, (2) that the period of the contravention was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the child, and (3) that the belief was based on reasonable grounds.   that the period of the contravention was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the child, and (3) that the belief was based on reasonable grounds.   that the belief was based on reasonable grounds.
the term “reasonable excuse” has been used in many statutes and is the subject of many reported decisions. but decisions on other statutes provide no guidance because what is a reasonable excuse depends not only on the circumstances of the individual case but also on the purpose of the provision to which the defence of “reasonable excuse” is an exception... ... however, the reality is that when legislatures enact defences such as “reasonable excuse” they effectively give, and intend to give, to the courts, the power to determine the content of such defences. defences in this form are categories of indeterminate reference that have no content until a court makes its decision. they effectively require the courts to prescribe the relevant rule of conduct after the fact of its occurrence. that being so, the courts must give effect to the will of parliament and give effect to their own ideas of what is a “reasonable excuse” in cases...
did the mother have a ‘reasonable excuse’ for contravening final orders?
