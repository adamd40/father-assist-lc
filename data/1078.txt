conclusion on whether the mother poses an unacceptable risk or not?  the evidence of the cce about the short, medium and long-term impacts upon the girls from not being able to continue to have a meaningful relationship with their father, (b) the mother’s failure to recognise the real and/or potential adverse impacts upon the girls’ ability to enhance their relationship with the father through – not allowing facetime communication to consistently occur (despite the december 2021 orders) and particularly after periods of trauma such as y making a disclosure against the paternal grandfather and then enduring five separate interventions by third parties as well as y’s experience at the sports centre followed up by her surgery the next day, not allowing facetime communication to occur in their family home so that they can have a quiet space to keep focused on their father and be able to let him see a setting which is comforting to them and which sends a message to them that the father

dad and then acting to ameliorate it, unilaterally withholding the girls from spending time with the father for about eight (8) weeks despite the alleged risk being about the paternal grandfather

concern for her welfare, (d) the mother’s propensity to act spontaneously and assume the worst about the father (or those around him) and then act unreasonably and against the welfare of the girls by, for example – driving interstate and only then taking the girls to see a doctor and then the police, all because of (apparently) allegations made earlier by them about their father crashing the car, exposing y to ms e in circumstances where the police observed (prior to the child being interviewed for the ms e report) that the child was not showing any adverse signs of sexual or physical harm and

what weight should i give to the views of the girls (or either of them?)
are the girls at psychological or emotional risk of harm in the sole care of the maternal grandmother because of her alleged frequent abuse of alcohol and poor emotional regulation?
what will be the impact upon the children (or either of them) if they were to live with the father in melbourne and spend time with the mother that amounts to something less than substantial and significant?  the superior parenting capacity she observed in the father as opposed to when the mother was caring for the children as part of the family report process[25], (b) the mother’s behaviours and actions which in combination caused the cce to hold concerns that the mother will continue to try to prevent the children having a relationship with mr hoffman (the father) and the extended paternal family[26]. (c) the mother appearing to have a hyper-focus which detracts from her capacity to focus on the children’s needs such as – not travelling back and forth unnecessarily to attend sports lessons after the family report interviews had concluded, with the cce noting that the mother appeared focussed on other matters such as what the orders said and/or the usual routine whereby she took the girls to sports[27], and the benefit to be gained by the girls spending extra time with the father and instead speaking of how any additional time between the girls and the father would mean less time for her[28].   the mother’s behaviours and actions which in combination caused the cce to hold concerns that the mother will continue to try to prevent the children having a relationship with mr hoffman (the father) and the extended paternal family[26].

what will be the impact upon the children (or either of them) if they live with the mother and spend time with the father (either more or less) than they currently do?  her being recently told that the maternal great grandmother had entered or was about to enter palliative care, (b) y being admitted for serious surgery the next day and the girls being separated, (c) her being shocked by seeing the paternal family at the family report interview location, and (d) her otherwise having to contend with the stress of the family report process itself (including seeing the father).   y being admitted for serious surgery the next day and the girls being separated, (c) her being shocked by seeing the paternal family at the family report interview location, and (d) her otherwise having to contend with the stress of the family report process itself (including seeing the father).   her being shocked by seeing the paternal family at the family report interview location, and (d) her otherwise having to contend with the stress of the family report process itself (including seeing the father).   her otherwise having to contend with the stress of the family report process itself (including seeing the father).   difficulties in focussing on both children at the same time, (b) failure to see that the children were happily playing and did not need further stimulation, (c) not always noticing what was occurring with the children because she was self-focussed, (d) making statements about her losing time with the children rather than seeing the practical benefit of less travelling time for the children to and from sports lessons, this is the mother the children have to contend with through the ups and downs of their young lives.   failure to see that the children were happily playing and did not need further stimulation, (c) not always noticing what was occurring with the children because she was self-focussed, (d) making statements about her losing time with the children rather than seeing the practical benefit of less travelling time for the children to and from sports lessons, this is the mother the children have to contend with through the ups and downs of their young lives.   not always noticing what was occurring with the children because she was self-focussed, (d) making statements about her losing time with the children rather than seeing the practical benefit of less travelling time for the children to and from sports lessons, this is the mother the children have to contend with through the ups and downs of their young lives.   making statements about her losing time with the children rather than seeing the practical benefit of less travelling time for the children to and from sports lessons, this is the mother the children have to contend with through the ups and downs of their young lives.
this is the mother the children have to contend with through the ups and downs of their young lives.   the girls’ current relationship with their father (and the extended paternal family) will be irretrievably damaged over time because the mother has an inability to focus on their needs before her own, and (b) the girls will continue to experience (to their detriment) the mother’s inconsistent and (at times) unfocussed parenting style.   the girls will continue to experience (to their detriment) the mother’s inconsistent and (at times) unfocussed parenting style.
other than what may have already been explored above, does the mother have a deficit in her capacity to provide for the needs of the children including emotionally and intellectually?
has the father engaged in violent, threatening or other behaviour that coerced or controlled the mother or caused physical harm to x?  both parties had a plausible explanation about how the heads of the mother and x collided, with it being common ground that the parties were arguing, (b) the father denied the allegations and despite what the mother asserted about isolating tactics that he may have engaged in, it appeared to be common ground that family members still travelled to victoria to visit the mother (for example in march 2021) and the mother frequently travelled interstate to visit them prior to the final separation (both with and without the father being present), (c) both parties had a plausible explanation for what occurred on the weekend before their final separation when the father asserted the mother was well aware he was taking the girls to town n (having invited her)[36] and the mother not putting what she asserted was some sort of ‘smoking gun’ to the father about text messages allegedly sent between them at the end of the trip[37] (such that the weight i could put on the document was very limited). in my mind, the debacle that occurred at the end of the weekend was a compelling example of (at the very least) how far the parties’ communication had deteriorated, (d) both parties had a plausible explanation for how the mother accessed joint funds and i was unable to make a finding that the father engaged in a financially controlling manner sufficient to meet the definition at s 4ab, (e) the father gave a plausible explanation for how he had access to the mother’s icloud account. he denied her allegations[38]. the mother stood by her evidence including that she had deleted from the ipad all the screenshots she said the father had inappropriately taken of her messages.[39] in light of their competing evidence and without any independent records to support either party’s claims, there was insufficient evidence upon which i could make the finding sought by the mother, (f) in addition, although not forming part of exhibit ‘b’ -

are there any other s 60cc(3) considerations relevant to the determination of the dispute – whether it would be preferable to make an order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings
what (if any) practical considerations are there if the girls live with the father and spend time with the mother in melbourne and/or in town f?
...the reality of the situation of parents and the child, not whether it is desirable that there be equal time spent by the child with each parent. the presumption in s 61da(1) is not determinative of the questions arising under s 65daa(1). section 65daa(1)(b) requires a practical assessment of whether equal time parenting is feasible.   emphasis)   reasonably practicable because the mother can either choose to bear all the costs of a road trip to melbourne or pay one-half of the girls’ flights (because she too sought this relief), but is (b) not reasonably practicable insofar as constraining where the mother can choose to spend time with the girls during the shorter holiday periods (because it asks me to speculate and/or disregard the mother’s evidence about this being unaffordable).   not reasonably practicable insofar as constraining where the mother can choose to spend time with the girls during the shorter holiday periods (because it asks me to speculate and/or disregard the mother’s evidence about this being unaffordable).
what (if any) practical considerations are there if the girls live with the mother and spend time with the father in town f and/or melbourne?
are the parents able to equally exercise all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authority in the making of major long-term decisions for the welfare of the girls? if the answer is ‘no’ – who should have parental responsibility for the girls and what (if any) notification should the other parent receive?  conflicts between what the mother’s treators recorded the mother’s background and relationship with ms b was like and what the mother recalls, (b) conflicts between what the police recorded telling (or not telling) the mother and what she recalls (which had some repercussions for y), and (c) conflicts between what the cce recorded the mother as saying and what she recalls telling the cce.   conflicts between what the police recorded telling (or not telling) the mother and what she recalls (which had some repercussions for y), and (c) conflicts between what the cce recorded the mother as saying and what she recalls telling the cce.   conflicts between what the cce recorded the mother as saying and what she recalls telling the cce.
with whom should the girls live?  she has a demonstrated history of ignoring court orders meaning that any prohibitive or positive restraints i could have put in place to try and quarantine the girls from her negative views about the father and the consequent deterioration in their meaningful relationship with him would be largely ineffective, (b) the only way that i can be certain she would comply with orders meant to preserve the girls’ meaningful relationship with their father must be ones where she can see that her interests (to have time or communicate with the girls) are secured, and (c) even if i accepted that she would comply with orders about time and communication without further road blocks, her ‘term time’ proposal was not reasonably practicable and doomed to fail.   the only way that i can be certain she would comply with orders meant to preserve the girls’ meaningful relationship with their father must be ones where she can see that her interests (to have time or communicate with the girls) are secured, and (c) even if i accepted that she would comply with orders about time and communication without further road blocks, her ‘term time’ proposal was not reasonably practicable and doomed to fail.   even if i accepted that she would comply with orders about time and communication without further road blocks, her ‘term time’ proposal was not reasonably practicable and doomed to fail.   it secured their meaningful relationship with the father, through them living with him, (b) it secured their meaningful relationship with the mother because there was no evidence that the father would do anything other than to promote it, and (c) there is no evidence that the father would do anything but comply with orders.   it secured their meaningful relationship with the mother because there was no evidence that the father would do anything other than to promote it, and (c) there is no evidence that the father would do anything but comply with orders.   there is no evidence that the father would do anything but comply with orders.
with the girls to live with the father in melbourne, what time should they spend with the mother – equal, substantial and significant or something else and will the time be reasonably practicable?
what arrangements should be made for the girls to communicate electronically or by telephone with each of their parents?
