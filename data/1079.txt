reasons for judgment
judge taglieri
contravention hearing 31 july 2023
sanction/consequential orders
as to ground 3, the primary judge imposed a bond “without surety and without security” (at [22]). how such a gentle sanction could be said to be a “plainly unjust” response to five contraventions is entirely opaque. if it be that the injustice lies in requiring the mother to comply with the consent orders she entered into on 4 april 2022 as varied, that is palpable nonsense.   the mother provide three make up visits for two hours at the earliest dates available, supervised at the city b contact centre, and (b) the mother thereafter complies with the order 19 made on 9 june 2023, and (c) the mother continues to comply with order 19 made on 9 june 2023.
