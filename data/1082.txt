legal principles and evaluation
absent the citation of binding or persuasive authority saying otherwise, the quasi-criminal nature of contempt applications warrants their differential treatment from conventional civil suits: they may be dismissed if the counts are inherently defective (and hence it would be an abuse of process to prosecute them) or if there is no case for the respondent to answer, but should not be dismissed because the counts ostensibly lack reasonable prospects of success. the proper procedure is recognised within rr 10.09(1)(c), 11.70(2), 11.71(6) and 11.71(7) of the rules.
evidence of contempt  continuing failure over many months to satisfy the terms of various orders made on 3 november 2021, 21 february 2021, 13 april 2022, 18 may 2022, 1 june 2022 and 20 september 2022, and (b) provision of false statement in an affidavit about custody or control of particular documents.   provision of false statement in an affidavit about custody or control of particular documents.
it is difficult to envisage a case where failure to comply with orders for disclosure could be said to involve a flagrant challenge to the authority of the court or where an established failure to fully disclose could be other than a contravention covered by part xiiia of the act and not part xiiib.
in our view, in the exercise of the ordinary powers of human reason in light of human experience of the conduct of litigation by lawyers, the inference drawn by cohen j beyond reasonable doubt was open to him.
