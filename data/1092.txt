statutory framework
s. 60cc(2) the primary considerations
the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents
the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
s.60cc(3) the additional considerations:
any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child's views
“[the court] was not required to determine that the wishes of the children were unsound, founded on improper considerations or influenced by others in order to make orders contrary to their wishes. while those considerations will be relevant in many cases, they are by no means the only issues that a trial judge must consider when considering a child's wishes. there are many factors that may go to the weight that should be given to the wishes of children and these will vary from case to case. it is undesirable and indeed impossible to catalogue or confine them in the manner suggested. ultimately it is a process of intuitive synthesis on the part of any trial judge weighing up all the evidence relevant to the wishes of the children and applying it in a common sense way as one of the factors in the overall assessment of the children's best interests”
the nature of the relationship of the child with (i) each of the child's parents, and (ii) other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child)
the extent to which each of the children's parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the children to spend time with them, and to communicate with them
the extent to which each of the children's parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of any changes in the children's circumstances, including the likely effect on the children of any separation from either of their parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom the children have been living
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect their right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the children's parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of the children, to provide for the needs of the children, including emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of their parents, and any other relevant characteristics of the children
if the children are aboriginal children or torres strait islander children, their right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to the children, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of their parents
any family violence involving the children or a member of their family  physically pushing and shoving past the mother after separation, (b) threatening the mother, including threats of physical violence, (c) telling the mother that she has mental health problems in front of the children, (d) threatening and intimidating behaviour, (e) damage to property in the presence of the children and threats to harm their pets, (f) controlling and coercive behaviour including limiting funds available to the mother, monitoring how she spends money and being uncooperative, (g) breaching an intervention order in 2018, and (h) actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.   threatening the mother, including threats of physical violence, (c) telling the mother that she has mental health problems in front of the children, (d) threatening and intimidating behaviour, (e) damage to property in the presence of the children and threats to harm their pets, (f) controlling and coercive behaviour including limiting funds available to the mother, monitoring how she spends money and being uncooperative, (g) breaching an intervention order in 2018, and (h) actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.   telling the mother that she has mental health problems in front of the children, (d) threatening and intimidating behaviour, (e) damage to property in the presence of the children and threats to harm their pets, (f) controlling and coercive behaviour including limiting funds available to the mother, monitoring how she spends money and being uncooperative, (g) breaching an intervention order in 2018, and (h) actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.   threatening and intimidating behaviour, (e) damage to property in the presence of the children and threats to harm their pets, (f) controlling and coercive behaviour including limiting funds available to the mother, monitoring how she spends money and being uncooperative, (g) breaching an intervention order in 2018, and (h) actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.   damage to property in the presence of the children and threats to harm their pets, (f) controlling and coercive behaviour including limiting funds available to the mother, monitoring how she spends money and being uncooperative, (g) breaching an intervention order in 2018, and (h) actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.   controlling and coercive behaviour including limiting funds available to the mother, monitoring how she spends money and being uncooperative, (g) breaching an intervention order in 2018, and (h) actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.   breaching an intervention order in 2018, and (h) actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.   actively encouraging the children to disobey directions and instructions given an rule set by the mother.
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the children or a member of their family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the children
any other relevant fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
