...[h]is inner template on which he relies for understanding and interpreting reality is likely to be at times compromised.
the mcmi-iv indicates that [mr danaher] is experiencing a moderate level of impairment on traits of paranoid, avoidant and schizoid personality disorder. his diffuse condition as indicated by trait impairment on mcmi-iv has at times resulted in clinical syndromes in the areas of dysthymia and severe anxiety disorder. [mr danaher]’s history suggests the presence of these traits although his functional level appears to be better than that predicted by the test. although a raft of diagnostic possibilities are raised by the test...his condition is best characterised by mixed personality disorder with paranoid, avoidant traits, with underlying long-term low self-esteem, (dysthymia) and generalised anxiety.
diagnostic clarity can be poor and from the perspective of a parenting assessment the critical issue is not so much the diagnosis but the impairments.   underlining)
weighing up the risks posed by the husband
he has always minimised his component in issues and said that it was other people’s fault. therefore, i am not sure that he can be helped until this way of thinking changes somewhat. [5]
the husband needs to develop insight or we are in serious difficulty.
