property conclusions
this asset pool does not reflect the cgt liability which i will incur if required to sell one or other of the properties...[20]
the evidence is of no assistance in assessing the probability or risk of sale of one or more of the properties. mr ninesh has equity in the properties approximating $1,100,000. he has substantial income from which he can service further borrowings. were he to apply his savings to the payment to ms palasar, finance the balance of the payment to her along with the existing home loan liabilities, the loan to value ratio on the properties would be approximately 80%.
