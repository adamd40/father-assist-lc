reasons for judgment
judge kearney

the father has not shown an ability to facilitate and encourage a close continuing relationship between the children and the mother. the father claims he wishes to support an ongoing relationship for the children with their mother, however, the father appeared to have no qualms about making negative statements about the mother in the presence of the children...  otnote removed)
“i refused to go back because that’s what dad would tell me to do, and i wanted him to be proud of me”. [w] then went on to say that the father would then blame [w] for the breach of the court orders and “tell me that i would be getting him in trouble by not going back”. [w] said that the father would then force [w] to hide if anyone came over (sic) the house looking for [w], and would then be proud of them for doing as he asked. [w] stated that this whole time has been very confusing and that over time they have thought about many inconsistencies in the father’s narrative about the mother and feels hurt and disappointed in themselves that they believed the father so readily ..
the father’s relentless negativity about the mother’s ability to parent and/or the value of her relationships with the children as opposed to his capacity and relationships with them.
...as a man it is not an easy place to be heard, let alone listened to and to be taken seriously in the family court. the odds of men being given primary custody over the mother are on average over 66% stacked in the mother’s favour. i came into this court in the naïve belief that i would be listened to by the court and that my testimony would be heard. i was not only my voice but also the voice of my four children [w], [x], [y] and [z]. when this case first started my children were very young and unable to adequately express their opinion and to tell their truth, to be able to truly tell the court of the ongoing and unrelenting continued abuse that they, and myself have endured over the years from my ex-wife and their mother. ...as i have stated the mother has physically, emotionally and financially abused me. ...... we all now know that the mother’s continued, ongoing and unrelenting abuse has continued unhindered since my time with the children was suspended. the mother has had five long years to change her behaviour and it is beyond clear that she cannot change and will not change. ...it is beyond clear that the mother continues to try and turn the children against me. the mother has clearly been doing this with my eldest daughter [w]. [w] and i always had an incredibly close and loving bond, now all she says is that she doesn’t want to be forced to see me...i don’t believe that [w] won’t see a counsellor. i suspect that the mother has been sending the children or at least [w] to a “re-education counsellor”... the mother by the looks of it attempted to destroy my relationships with all the children. the mother has blamed me the entire time for her failure to maintain a loving relationship with all of the children... the mother is and will continue to abuse the children...she will not stop abusing the children, the mother has had five incredibly long years to change and she has refused to change and i expect that she has only gotten worse...  have altered the text to remove the syntax errors so that the content can be more

the father being unable or unwilling to regulate his emotions.  in relation to what the family consultant said about w’s current presentation – the father acknowledged he had breached court orders and had made mistakes, but that there was more to w’s anger and hurt than had been said by the family consultant (whose family report identified all the material read and the interviews conducted with the parents and w). after challenging the basis for the family consultant’s views, the father went on to say “i think i know [w] even better than the mother.” (b) in relation to the younger children’s expressions about seeing their father – the father submitted this –   in relation to the younger children’s expressions about seeing their father – the father submitted this –

the father’s proposal  these parties (in particular the father) have already failed once to implement time as per the final 2020 orders, and (b) there is no communication whatsoever between the parties which is entirely consistent with the finding already made by me about the father perpetrating coercive and controlling behaviour such that the power imbalance felt by the mother would make it virtually impossible for her to negotiate with him for fear that he will simply either ignore what she says and/or the content of any orders that may be in place that he no longer agrees with.   there is no communication whatsoever between the parties which is entirely consistent with the finding already made by me about the father perpetrating coercive and controlling behaviour such that the power imbalance felt by the mother would make it virtually impossible for her to negotiate with him for fear that he will simply either ignore what she says and/or the content of any orders that may be in place that he no longer agrees with.

conclusion – parenting orders
the issues - financial
what approach should i take to consider the parties’ property interests?  the wife made no contribution to town hh and the proceeds arising from the sale of the two tasmanian properties and therefore no adjustment was needed to be made and rather the husband should retain the full benefit of those interests, (b) the contributions of the parties’ to the rest of their non-superannuation property interests meant that the wife should receive 75% of the sale money, and (c) the contributions of the parties’ to their superannuation interests meant that the wife should retain her superannuation and 25% of the husband’s superannuation with superannuation fund 1.   the contributions of the parties’ to the rest of their non-superannuation property interests meant that the wife should receive 75% of the sale money, and (c) the contributions of the parties’ to their superannuation interests meant that the wife should retain her superannuation and 25% of the husband’s superannuation with superannuation fund 1.   the contributions of the parties’ to their superannuation interests meant that the wife should retain her superannuation and 25% of the husband’s superannuation with superannuation fund 1.   either the nature or value of his interest in town hh when the parties commenced their relationship, (b) the value of his interest in the two tasmanian properties when the parties commenced their relationship, (c) the value of his superannuation interest in superannuation fund 1 when the parties commenced their relationship.   the value of his interest in the two tasmanian properties when the parties commenced their relationship, (c) the value of his superannuation interest in superannuation fund 1 when the parties commenced their relationship.   the value of his superannuation interest in superannuation fund 1 when the parties commenced their relationship.
when did the parties separate?
what does the balance sheet look like?
first, it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. so much follows from the text of section 79(1)(a) itself, which refers to “altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property”. the question posed by section 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order.
ordinarily, where a particular interest is property of the parties or either of them it may be the subject of a direct order under section 79. on the other hand, if it is not property but a “financial resource”, a direct order may not be made in relation to it, but it may be taken into account in deciding what orders to make in respect of any property of the parties. the above statement is subject to the qualification that the concept of what is “property” is very wide, but there may be property in relation to which it is either impracticable or inappropriate to make a direct order.   emphasis)

as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.   the limited scope of the outstanding disclosure asserted within the wife’s typed list of issues[25] and the lack of more recent correspondence (perhaps following the issue of the employer l subpoena) which would have put the unrepresented husband on notice of the wife’s intention to seek an add-back due to his lack of disclosure, (b) the duration of time (over four (4) years) that has transpired between when the husband received the benefit of the payment and now, (c) the father’s evidence that at least in may 2021 the husband was unemployed and so logically may have expended some of the redundancy on supporting himself, (d) the likelihood that the quantum of the redundancy may be reflective of his longstanding employment with employer l (part of which only he would have made a contribution towards), (e) the husband’s oral testimony that he spent the funds on meeting his daily needs, and (f) the lack of persuasive evidence that the husband has wasted the redundancy, notwithstanding that i acknowledge that it may be that within the same time period that he had the benefit of the redundancy, the mortgage over the former family home fell into arrears which (if there had been evidence of it) could have demonstrated that the husband should have redirected the redundancy towards meeting those payments.   the duration of time (over four (4) years) that has transpired

the husband’s sale proceeds of tasmanian properties
the husband’s exposure to three costs orders
why do the parties want me to make a property adjustment order?
how should i assess and weigh the parties’ contributions?  at the start of the relationship (2007) the husband had an interest in town hh, more than likely a half-share in two parcels of real estate in tasmania (which may have been subject to a mortgage) and accrued entitlements and superannuation interests from his employment with employer l, (b) during the relationship the husband worked full-time for employer l and said that he continued to make contributions towards the conservation of the tasmanian properties, (c) post-separation, in about 2018, the husband received $120,326.75 via a redundancy and in about 2019, the husband’s interests in the tasmanian properties crystallised and he received $41,650. no specific documents were disclosed by the husband that could satisfy the wife about how these lump sums were dissipated and in the witness box, the husband said that the funds were spent on day-to-day living expenses, (d) the wife initially worked as an educator but withdrew from the workforce to support the household and provide the primary care to the parties’ four children, (e) the wife has accumulated a modest superannuation interest arising from her employment.   during the relationship the husband worked full-time for employer l and said that he continued to make contributions towards the conservation of the tasmanian properties, (c) post-separation, in about 2018, the husband received $120,326.75 via a redundancy and in about 2019, the husband’s interests in the tasmanian properties crystallised and he received $41,650. no specific documents were disclosed by the husband that could satisfy the wife about how these lump sums were dissipated and in the witness box, the husband said that the funds were spent on day-to-day living expenses, (d) the wife initially worked as an educator but withdrew from the workforce to support the household and provide the primary care to the parties’ four children, (e) the wife has accumulated a modest superannuation interest arising from her employment.   post-separation, in about 2018, the husband received $120,326.75 via a redundancy and in about 2019, the husband’s interests in the tasmanian properties crystallised and he received $41,650. no specific documents were disclosed by the husband that could satisfy the wife about how these lump sums were dissipated and in the witness box, the husband said that the funds were spent on day-to-day living expenses, (d) the wife initially worked as an educator but withdrew from the workforce to support the household and provide the primary care to the parties’ four children, (e) the wife has accumulated a modest superannuation interest arising from her employment.   the wife initially worked as an educator but withdrew from the workforce to support the household and provide the primary care to the parties’ four children, (e) the wife has accumulated a modest superannuation interest arising from her employment.   the wife has accumulated a modest superannuation interest arising from her employment.   she refused to go to work when asked, (b) she didn’t look after the children because there were in day care (five days a week), and (c) she didn’t clean the house to an acceptable standard.   she didn’t look after the children because there were in day care (five days a week), and (c) she didn’t clean the house to an acceptable standard.   she didn’t clean the house to an acceptable standard.
...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weigh all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post‑separation period.   the unquantified but nonetheless agreed initial financial contributions made by the husband, most of which either the husband retains the benefit of it now including town hh, superannuation fund 1and the sale proceeds from the tasmanian properties, (b) the post-separation non-financial contributions the wife has made towards the ongoing care of the children.   the post-separation non-financial contributions the wife has made towards the ongoing care of the children.
are there any relevant future needs?  paid lip-service to his obligations to make full and frank disclosure (including not fully complying with orders for disclosure), (b) dissipated over $200,000 since at least 2018 when he first received his employer l redundancy, followed by the sale proceeds from the tasmanian properties, (c) failed to conserve the former family home by falling into arrears of the mortgage (which may or may not have impacted on the parties’ credit ratings and/or the nett sale proceeds available for distribution at trial) and then leaving the home in a dishevelled state including by causing the wife to firstly engage a locksmith so she could gain access and then causing her and her associates to have the place tidied up so it was ready for sale.   dissipated over $200,000 since at least 2018 when he first received his employer l redundancy, followed by the sale proceeds from the tasmanian properties, (c) failed to conserve the former family home by falling into arrears of the mortgage (which may or may not have impacted on the parties’ credit ratings and/or the nett sale proceeds available for distribution at trial) and then leaving the home in a dishevelled state including by causing the wife to firstly engage a locksmith so she could gain access and then causing her and her associates to have the place tidied up so it was ready for sale.   failed to conserve the former family home by falling into arrears of the mortgage (which may or may not have impacted on the parties’ credit ratings and/or the nett sale proceeds available for distribution at trial) and then leaving the home in a dishevelled state including by causing the wife to firstly engage a locksmith so she could gain access and then causing her and her associates to have the place tidied up so it was ready for sale.
is not to achieve equality in the financial strengths of the parties, nonetheless the overarching obligation is to achieve a just and equitable division of the property.[33]   the husband has double the income-earning capacity of the wife, (b) the wife will have the full-time care of the children, (c) the husband has expended over $200,000 in the past four to five years and did not make full disclosure of how those funds were spent, (d) the husband’s poor conduct around appropriately conserving the former family home.   the wife will have the full-time care of the children, (c) the husband has expended over $200,000 in the past four to five years and did not make full disclosure of how those funds were spent, (d) the husband’s poor conduct around appropriately conserving the former family home.   the husband has expended over $200,000 in the past four to five years and did not make full disclosure of how those funds were spent, (d) the husband’s poor conduct around appropriately conserving the former family home.   the husband’s poor conduct around appropriately conserving the former family home.
is the outcome just and equitable?  from the sale money – (i) the wife shall receive $317,704 or about 95%, (ii) before the husband receives the balance 5% - $6,740 will be deducted in satisfaction of the outstanding costs orders and paid as directed by the wife with the husband to receive the rest as directed by him, (b) from superannuation fund 1, a splitting order will be made amounting to $266,897, although the making of the order will be deferred to enable procedural fairness to be given to the relevant trustee, (c) the parties will retain all other property interests that are in their power, possession or control.   the wife shall receive $317,704 or about 95%, (ii) before the husband receives the balance 5% - $6,740 will be deducted in satisfaction of the outstanding costs orders and paid as directed by the wife with the husband to receive the rest as directed by him,  ) before the husband receives the balance 5% - $6,740 will be deducted in satisfaction of the outstanding costs orders and paid as directed by the wife with the husband to receive the rest as directed by him,   from superannuation fund 1, a splitting order will be made amounting to $266,897, although the making of the order will be deferred to enable procedural fairness to be given to the relevant trustee, (c) the parties will retain all other property interests that are in their power, possession or control.   the parties will retain all other property interests that are in their power, possession or control.
