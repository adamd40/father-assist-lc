the parents
child inclusive assessment  said that his mother also protected him from his father when his father was yelling at him (‘mum tried to protect me. she’s the best mum. she told him to stop [yelling at him] but he [the father] doesn’t stop.’ he said that he felt ‘angry, frightened and scared’ when his father yelled at him.
during the interview, [x] asked the writer to stop referring to [the father] as ‘dad’ and asked if [the father] could be referred to as ‘you know who’ instead. when asked why, [x] explained that he feels ‘angry, scared and sad’ when he hears ‘dad’. [x] described his father in wholly negative terms (‘bad and always mean’). he said that his father ‘yells a lot’ and added ‘i hate him, i don’t like him at all’. [x] spoke about being frightened of [the father] and scared for his and [the mother’s] safety when his father was also present. he said that his father behaved in an aggressive way towards him and his mother. for example, [x] said that his father said ‘bad’ things to his mother including the ‘f-word, b-word and m-word’. when asked to explain the meaning of each letter, [x] whispered ‘fuck, bitch and motherfucker’.
... he has been exposed to family violence and has been in situations and/or exposed to incidents which have made him feel unsafe and frightened. this has resulted in [x] worrying (and possibly being preoccupied with worry) about his and his mother’s safety. [x] appears to have cut/split off from feeling anything positive towards [the father]. it is possible that, due to his young age and stage of development, this is the only way he can manage and tolerate the intense negative feelings he has towards his father. it is also very likely that [x] has taken on a protective role towards [the mother] that is beyond his young age and capability, and this has emotionally burdened him. (bold emphasis added)
... the most immediate and pressing need for [x] is for him to be protected from harm - physical, emotional, and psychological - whether direct or indirect, and be given some reprieve from the immense pressure of feeling caught in the middle of his parents and worrying about his and his mother’s safety. [x] also needs for his mother to regain control over her emotional and psychological health and wellbeing (through counselling) so that she can continue to give priority to his needs and protection. expecting [x] to have any contact with [the father] would likely place him ([x]) under considerable pressure, which could have a deleterious impact on his emotional and psychological wellbeing, and this is not in his best interests.
single expert report  offered that he does not like calling him dad. he said he calls him you-know-who. [x] said he does not like his father’s real name or the d. a. d (as he spelt) word and said he thinks the best word for him is you-know-who. when asked how he came to arrive at you-know-who being the best word for dad, [x] said it was him. [x] said he does not want to be reminded of him by the word because he has done really bad things and made him upset. when asked if he remembered any of these things, [x] said he remembered some of them but not all of them because he is not trying to remember because he is trying to live his life.   impressed as possibly irrevocably impacted by his experiences of family life pre-separation. he is closely engaged with his mother in their new life, attending a new school and living in a home whose address he is pleased that is unknown to [the father]. he seems to have adopted the psychological strategies of expunging [the father], the strategies being never referring to [the father] as dad but rather as you-know-who, not wishing to think or talk about his father, doing his best to forget [the father], rejecting him as part of the family, and wishing him to be incarcerated or dead. [x] has become split in his relationships with his parents, fully aligned with [the mother] who he experiences as caring, fun and protective, and [the father] who he rejects as a bad, troublesome person who he hates.   presently does not have a connection with his father. the crux of the family law dispute is whether or not it is safe for [x] to spend time with [the father] and, if so, how their relationship should proceed, and in what shape and form.
the law
primary considerations  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
meaningful relationship
... should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents ...
no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
family violence
fogarty j stated it is necessary for a trial judge to give real and substantial consideration to the facts of the case and to decide whether or not, and why or why not, those facts could be said to raise an unacceptable risk of harm to the child (at 82,713-82,714) and, furthermore, the qualitative analysis of the evidence must be directed not just to the existence of the risk of harm but also the magnitude of the possible harm (at 82,714).
and agreed with and adopted the dissenting judgment of austin j in fitzwater & fitzwater [2019] famcafc 251, (2019) 60 fam lr 212 as being the correct statement of the law. his honour’s judgment includes the following: the assessment of risk is a predictive exercise and while it is, naturally enough, liable to be influenced by factual findings about past events, the contemplation of risk entails the foresight of possible harm. it is an oddity to expect that the mere possibility of future harm can or should be proven as a probability, as has been implied before (potter and potter [2007] famca 350, (2007) flc 93-326 at [110], [129]). risks of harm must be heeded even if they are improbable eventualities. speaking of the risk of some future occurrence is just another way of expressing the chance of it happening. the concept of chance lies along a continuum, encompassing all outcomes which lie in the range between highly probable and remotely possible, assuming the polar extremes of certainty are ignored. in the current context, the higher the chance of the children’s sexual abuse, the greater the risk of their physical or psychological harm. at some point on the continuum the risk of such harm becomes so potent it cannot be tolerated: it is unacceptable.

her honour: well, it was more than that. you said, ‘it was quite a scene”?---it was quite a scene, yes, so yes. so, what do you mean by that?---i mean yelling, screaming. i mean she definitely took it and ran in the hotel room. i never grabbed her or threw her into a wall, but yes, it wasn’t - it wasn’t - it wasn’t pleasant. i didn’t think there was any need for - for the - the marijuana to be taken and as - that to happen in the first place. granted, shouldn’t be smoking marijuana, all the rest of it, but i don’t feel like that was necessarily required at the time, but nor was my reaction. so, i think between the two of us, it was, as i say, it was a scene, yes. mr squires: okay. when you say your reaction, what do you mean by that, that you say, nor was your reaction?---well, i just wasn’t happy that it was taken. all right?---yes. so, yes. her honour: so, you had been smoking an illegal substance on your trip up from sydney to [region m], is that right?---at times, yes, of an - once we finished driving, not when i was driving. had you - - - mr cohen: your honour, just to clarify that, it’s not actually an illegal substance. it’s an illegal substance without a script, but i mean, that’s - i don’t know whether it takes things much further. her honour: did you have a script?---no, not at the time. thank you. and on the evening, or when you were in the hotel, had you smoked marijuana that - - -?---before this? yes?---no. had you smoked marijuana that day?---no. when you - when the mother took the marijuana from you, you said that you were yelling and screaming. was [x] in the room when that happened?---yes, [x] would have been around, yes. was [x] in the room when the mother ran away, using your words, with the marijuana?---yes, he would have been. he’s only one so he was with us at pretty well the whole time, you know. where did the mother run to?---just around the bed. all right. and did you follow her?---yes. did [x] see that?---i’m not sure. i mean, he was only one, he - he was - he may well have been in the - - - that was in his presence though?---yes, correct. and did you continue to yell and scream while you were following the mother around the bed?---wasn’t yelling and screaming the whole time, no. i mean, there was two people yelling at each other, but no. did you yell and scream as you followed the mother around the bed?---quite possibly, yes, yes. did the mother yell and scream as she was leaving you around the bed?---yes. there was screaming both ways, yes. yelling rather than screaming, yelling. when you say then that it was quite a scene, you say that you took the marijuana, ‘i just took it back,’ is what you said, did you take it from the mother’s hand?---i can’t recall. it’s possible, yes. because you did say you took it from her hand, and then you said you were not sure?---yes. so, i want you to think about that. did you take it from her hand?---i can’t be exactly sure, but yes, it’s certainly possible, yes. i mean, it’s - it was quite a while - - - well, was the mother willing to give it to you at that point?---i’m not sure. well, think about it?---like i say, it - it sort of - it got to the point where the argument was going nowhere and i think it was a combination of giving it back or - - - no, that’s not my question. my question was, when you took it from her hand, was the mother willing to give it to you?---probably not, no. yes. so, it’s likely, isn’t it, that the mother - from the mother’s perspective at the very least, you snatched something from her hand?---yes. and that thing that you’ve snatched was your marijuana?---yes. did you then leave the room immediately?---i believe so, yes. did you slam the door or anything like that?---no. okay. what - did you smoke marijuana when you left the room?---no, i don’t believe so, no. all right. are you sure about that?---yes.

... did not seem to recognise that his approach to parenting, particularly his notion that referring to [x] as a stupid idiot, may be harmful to [x], until questioned by the writer ... it is possible that [mr halliday] using the phrase stupid idiot is representative of a broader parenting style, along the lines of an unresponsive, authoritarian parenting style. such an approach to parenting is commonly employed by perpetrators of family violence.

the father’s mental health
mr squires: she [the mother] said that she took it very seriously because, in the toy room [in mid] 2015, you had talked about [self-harm] the evening you drew the sketch board. did you have a conversation with the mother to that effect [in mid] 2015, [mr halliday]?--- not that i’m aware of. i mean, it’s possible there was a conversation talking about [self-harm]. i don’t believe so. but yes, there was periods where i wasn’t in the best way throughout the relationship. and that that could well be a time, yes.
it’s an admission that i drew the image, not an admission that i drew [x]. i think we need to be clear where the - where it sits.
ms k e father] denied that he engaged in a pattern of coercive controlling family violence. he strongly denied that he physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically abused his former partner.
her honour: ... when he said that he behaved aggressively, did he - did you take it to mean that having made that admission, he still validly maintained that he was denying physical, verbal, emotional, psychological abuse?--- yes.
the mother’s mental health
... communicating with [the father] was very anxiety provoking for [the mother] and she encouraged her to set boundaries to alleviate such. [ms j] said that she would not see [the mother]’s level of anxiety subsiding if she were required to have future communication with [the father]. she said that if she communicates with [the father], [the father] ends up back in her head.
the details of the descriptions of [the father]’s behaviour, her behaviour in response, and [x]’s reactions, would suggest a narrative that comes from her experiences in the relationship with [the father]. her level of distress, on recall of the incidences, suggests that her feelings are triggered by memories which are traumatic. [the mother] would appear to have experienced family violence with resultant emotional trauma, a not uncommon legacy of experiences of family violence.
oral evidence of the family consultant
firstly, i would like to say that interview almost took my breath away in terms of the strength and the negativity of [x]’s comments about his father. they are very troubling. they would reflect probably a range of things. i don’t think it’s simply one directional here. i don’t think it’s simply a matter of [x] observed or witnessed something [sic] and therefore has arrived at this point. i don’t actually think that’s the case. i think [x] has been exposed to dynamics which are probably incorporating a range of negative interactions between his parents, overlaid with then what i’ve described in my report as - as quite potent and a pattern of family violence. so i think we’ve got both of those things - cycles going. and then we’ve got mum’s reaction and responses, which typically are going to be emotional. there’s not going to be a rational, generally, response. they will be from a place of - you know, if mum’s account is correct and what i have assessed is most likely correct then her responses are going to be of a place of trauma. and then you have that cycle impacting on [x] and his view of dad. and you would then, beyond that, have feedback loops going on between the two of them around probably anxiety to the point of phobia. and we know that anxiety transmits. it’s one of the few mental health conditions that actually literally transmits. and particularly between parents who have experienced family violence and their children. so trying to break those cycles is probably number one, i would think, for [x] at the moment. and that’s why i suggested the no-time.
... [x]’s interview speaks of trauma. so it’s not [x] saying i would like to not see dad. it’s so his message is coming from, i think, a place of trauma. and the words are almost secondary. it’s the tone, it’s the negativity, it’s the strength of his position that i think are - are his sort of global views as opposed to his distinct wishes. and, i agree, i don’t think a child of his age’s distinct wishes should drive but we certainly have to take into account the place that a child has arrived emotionally at age nine. and if that’s a place which they’re yelling out loud that they don’t wish to be, then we’ve got to take that into account.
it’s just reinforcing, it’s just another - another layer for [x] to deal with, another emotional challenge, more reminders of, you know, the - the past, incidents of the past, even, let’s be frank, conversations that, you know, mum might have had that he has overheard. so more reminders. so taking him backwards rather than forwards.   does not have the emotional reserve or will to see his father and that [the mother] does not have the confidence in [the father] or belief that she could, or it would be of benefit to [x] for her to support [x] to see [the father]. it is suggested that [x] and [the mother] should now be free to build their life absent of any need to consider contact with [the father].
... the psychological risk to [x] of not seeing his father is something haven’t we [sic] been talking about. and that is very relevant. i would like to have been able to write a report to be able to enable [x] to be able to [sic] spend time with his father. but - and i think [mr halliday] has, you know, very many attributes which would enable him to be a good father to [x]. but the point that everyone has arrived at here is that [x] now is estranged from his father. he can’t even contemplate his father. his therapist thinks that [x]’s going to benefit very much from pretty well getting on with life and being a child of his age, rather than any more years being consumed by the question of whether to re-engage with dad. i think that’s how i would put it. and i think that’s why [sic] my assessment tells me too. even though i don’t like that idea very much at all for [x], i would much prefer [x] had an opportunity to resolve this - you know, we could say hatred for his father. i would like that but i don’t think it’s realistic. and i think weighing up the risks to him, he needs to have some years before adolescence of getting on with childhood, being relieved of being at the centre of what are some really serious troubling dynamics in the family. being protected from that. and that might give [x] the best chance of a reconnection later on. and, you know, maybe not too later on but some connection later on.
... we need to get back to [x]. [x] is the child - is a - is - is the person in this situation who has this great psychological risk of not having a father in his life. that is - that is a risk. that is - that is a very important aspect of this report, that this loss, this potential abandonment, this - ‘my father is actually still alive. he hasn’t died. we haven’t had a funeral. we haven’t had all the gestures around that kind of loss’. this is very complicated for [x]. [x]’s trauma right now - response is probably as much, or at least in part, due to that fact as well as his experiences with his parents. so to preserve the potential from [sic] him reconnecting with his father, i would say, is... very high on my priorities of writing this report.
