the court notes that:
reasons for judgment
judge taglieri
given the recent parental separation and the children’s disrupted attachment with the usual home-school and father, it is likely that there has been some emotional impact of harm on the children.
determination
his honour’s comment “given no other evidence” suggests that his honour required corroboration or objective support for the mother’s allegations in proof of them. to so suggest is an error. family violence only takes place in private in circumstances where no corroboration is available.
