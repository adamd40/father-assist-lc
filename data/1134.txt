4aa(3) no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. 4aa(4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case. ...
... each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point at one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitude and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test.
relevant relationship history in this case
25 in 2006, there was an incident between [mr besser] and i as follows: [mr besser] was not living with me at this time but was residing with a friend at [g street]. upon [mr besser] arriving at my home, he quickly became aggressive towards me. i asked him to leave, and this resulted in him throwing a coffee cup at me and hitting me in the back of the head. i was knocked unconscious and when i regained consciousness i was on the floor in the hallway. i was bleeding heavily from the back of my head. i was in shock and scared for my safety. i recall that [mr besser] had a gun with him. i was able to locate bullets in his bag and put them in a pot plant in my home. i was terrified that he would shoot me if he found them. once [mr besser] realised the bullets were missing, he came into the spare bedroom, where i was sitting in the corner, hiding, trying to stop the bleeding, and he started yelling at me and demanding the bullets. during this argument i could hear other people in my home, i was not aware who these people were. [mr besser] proceeded to hit me in the head and body and i not sure [sic] whether it was his fists or the gun. after some time, i took an opportunity to grab my car keys to try and go to the hospital. as i was trying to start my car, he grabbed me and pulled me out of the car. he kicked me repeatedly in the front yard yelling at me to get back into the house. i was scared that i was going to die on this occasion. [mr besser] forced me to sit at the kitchen table and called me horrible and degrading names and told me that i was a ‘dead woman’. he forced me into his car and drove me around for a while. after he finally took me home, he told me words to the effect of “if you call the cops, i’m going to come back to finish you off.” due to my fear of him, i did not contact the police. approximately two (2) weeks later, he returned to my home and accused me of stealing his guns. he hit me with [an object]. as he searched my home, i ran to a neighbour’s home and begged them not to open the door and to call the police. [mr besser] came to their door with a knife demanding that they neighbours [sic] send me out. i was terrified that he would get through the door or that the neighbours would make me leave. once the police arrived, they took my statement and [mr besser] had already returned to his residence at [g street]. i was informed by the police when the police attended to arrest [mr besser], that he appeared from behind the lounge and pointed a gun at the police and threatened to shoot the officer. following this was a [...] siege before the police were able to enter safety and arrest him.
26 in [late] 2015, there was an incident between [mr besser] and i as follows: [mr besser] and i drove to melbourne and stayed in a motel overnight. [mr besser] became angry towards me and began accusing me of cheating on him, i was standing next to the bed and [mr besser] shoved me causing me to fall across the bed. i was concerned for my safety and scared of [mr besser], so the following morning i changed motels. [mr besser] sent me a message words to the effect of “you’re a gutless piece of shit” and further stated that i should catch a bus or train home and demanded that i had to transfer $20,000 into his account within twenty-four (24) hours or not to bother returning home. [in late] 2015, [mr besser] texted me and told me that he had asked a friend to go to my house and get all of his belongings. [mr besser] sent me a further text messaged stating that he had told his friend that if my son, [mr j], was to get in his was that he was ‘free to take care of him’. [mr besser] advised me that he was catching a flight and that he would be waiting at my home with a petrol drum. [in late] 2015, [mr besser] sent me a text message advising that he was burning his way through my wardrobe. [in late] 2015, [mr besser] sent me a text message stating words to the effect of “you got the check for me?” he further sent pictures and videos of him burning my clothes and shoes. i felt unsafe and stayed in melbourne for a few days hoping that [mr besser] would calm down and i could return home. as i had packed minimal clothes and observed [mr besser] to be burning my clothes at home, i purchased two suitcases of new clothing. i do not recall that day that i returned home from melbourne, however, [mr besser] was waiting for me when i arrived. i had to walk around to the back door as i was unable to open the front door. i saw [mr besser] sitting on the back steps with a petrol container next to him. i dropped the suitcases and tried to run for my life from [mr besser]. [mr besser] grabbed me outside of the neighbour’s house and knocked me to the ground. i thought that i was going to die. [mr besser] proceeded to jump on me, punching me in the face several times and stated words to the effect of “i’m going to break your nose.” i recall there being another person present who was speaking to [mr besser] and they both left me on the ground. after a period of time, i was able to stumble to the shops nearby and i hid at the back of one of the shops. the owner let me use his phone to call the police. i observed [mr besser] to be driving past the shops look around [sic] for me. i was so scared that he was going to find me. the police arrived and took me to the police station where i made a statement, and i was informed that upon the police attending my home that [mr besser] was nowhere to be found. i returned home and had to smash the window to gain entry as the front door had been padlocked from the inside and the back door had also been padlocked. i continued to significantly be concerned for my safety and worried that [mr besser] would return and try to burn me in my home with both doors padlocked. as a result, i left to go stay a friend’s house for several days. as a result of this assault, i had a broken nose and black eyes. i was bruised on my arm and had scratches on my ear. after i was informed that [mr besser] was in custody, i returned home. however, approximately a week later, i was informed by one of [mr besser's] friends that [mr besser] had been bailed and was at [k mental health centre]. i spoke to [mr besser], and he sounded sincere regarding his actions and that he was trying to help and work on his aggression towards me. [mr besser] informed me that they would not release him without a place to stay and that he had nowhere else to go. [mr besser] begged me to let him back into my home. i regretfully allowed [mr besser] to return to my home, however, i wanted to believe that he was sorry and i also scared of what he would do if i did not let him back into my home. i attended court in relation to this assault and [mr besser] was found guilty. [mr besser] was not sentenced to any gaol time. however, a final advo was put in place for my protection for 12 months.
finished, over, & done. you don’t care how i feel, i have no say. you constantly do things that you know will piss me off. let people in my house who are scum even when i ask you not to. i think the only reason you are still at my house is your to lazy..... you sit around doing nothing all day every day. yet you had the hide to say [mr j] was lazy & doing nothing. telling me you wash up and vacuum everyday, lies, to get me & [mr j] fighting. you have everyone running around for you & you don’t and can’t be bothered to do anything to make me happy. i sick of you snoring every night & doing nothing about it. when i got tv on it’s the end of the world cause you can’t sleep. welcome to my world. i have to say that i know you take pleasure in pissing me off. and go out of your way to be a cunt to me. i put up with your crap for too long, over it!!
did the de facto relationship end in 2018?
... between 2018 to 2021, i asked [mr besser] to move out on many occasions, however, this would result in [mr besser] becoming very angry, aggressive and violent towards me including screaming and yelling at me, punching me or pushing me to the ground. due to this i became incredibly fearful for my safety if i mentioned [mr besser] moving out.
did the de facto relationship resume thereafter and only come to a final end in 2021?

events in early 2021:
premises occupied by the accused [mr besser] and his de facto partner [ms vaudry].
the accused in this matter is [mr besser] and the victim is [ms vaudry]. the accused and victim have been in a domestic relationship for the past 20 years and are currently living together at [the home]. there are no current apprehended violence orders between the accused and victim and no children as a result of their relationship. the accused and victim are now separated but still living together at the above address, with the accused sleeping on the lounge.
none of your business.
consideration of the relationship from 2018 onwards
sadly, however, as [counsel for the husband] submitted, evidence of domestic violence in a relationship can have limited relevance to determining whether a de facto relationship existed...   emphasis)
i am not satisfied that such indications of a de facto relationship as can be pointed to from 2018 onwards in fact bring the relationship within the statutory definition.
