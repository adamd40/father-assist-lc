reasons for judgment
judge glass:
evidentiary issues   denys] and i met online and met in person in late 2012, i was surprised that she [had a disability], [communicating with her was very difficult], i told her upfront that i was only wanting a freindship! [ms denys] and myself had a friendship for about one year but after time i found if very difficult to communicate with her the frienship peterred out after around twelve months. i never heard from [ms denys] again until the middle of 2015, she contacted me that the house that she was living in was to be demolished and she had nowhere to live so i relucuantly said to her that she could rent a room in my house, she told me that her friends and family didn't want her so i buckled and let her rent a room in my house. while she was living in my house i was on single newstart allowance until i turned sixty five, in 2020 then i went onto the single aged pension and [ms denys] was on single disability pension as far as i know.[10] (as per original)
circumstances of the relationship
the duration of the relationship
the nature and extent of the parties’ common residence
you were, um, trying to get me to move in. you were saying to me, please move in. and i actually asked why, and you said because i love you, i love you, i want you to live with me in the house, in your house. you know, the fact that i was helping you. you were begging me. you said, you know, i’m struggling with money, please come and live with me.
counsel for [ms denys]: all right. and do you know whether or not [ms denys] ever slept in [mr kellett]’s room? [ms o]: of course. always. counsel for [ms denys]: all right. so from what you saw, [ms denys] would always sleep in [mr kellett]’s room. is that right? [ms o]: when i would sleep over, in the morning [ms denys] would come out of his bedroom. so obviously they were together. i mean, i wasn’t there every day.[17]
counsel for [ms denys]: and it’s a photo of you in bed, isn’t it, with the cats? [mr kellett]: yes. counsel for [ms denys]: and you see all the knickknacks on the left-hand side of the bed, don’t you? [mr kellett]: yes, i do see them. counsel for [ms denys]: yes. and they are [ms denys]’, aren’t they? [mr kellett]: no, they’re not [ms denys]’. counsel for [ms denys]: and there are numerous knickknacks above the left-hand side of the bed, in the bedhead. do you see those? [mr kellett]: yes. counsel for [ms denys]: they are [ms denys]’, aren’t they? [mr kellett]: i don’t believe so. counsel for [ms denys]: when you say you don’t believe so, sir, whose are they? [mr kellett]: mine.[18]
whether a sexual relationship existed  kellett] and i lived together as boyfriend/girlfriend, or partners, as the case may be... we enjoyed a committed (sexual) relationship...[21] .... [mr kellett] and i shared the same bedroom for many years. we were in an intimate and sexual relationship during this time. we had sex regularly. more often than not, [mr kellett] instigated sexual relations between us. in any event, i have never forced [mr kellett] to, or performed any sexual act on [mr kellett], without his consent.[22]
the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between the parties
the ownership, use and acquisition of the parties’ property
... [mr kellett] was looking to buy a house. we looked at houses together. ultimately, [mr kellett] purchased the property at [t street] in [suburb b] ("[suburb b] ") which later became our shared residence. i provided the initial holding deposit for [suburb b], in the amount of either $1000 or $2000.[24]
counsel for [ms denys]: yes. then prior to you purchasing the house in [suburb b], did you look at other properties? [mr kellett]: i looked at one. it was actually one day – i saw a house in the morning, and i saw this house – the second house. that’s when it was purchased. i didn’t look at numerous properties, no. just the two – one – both in [suburb b]. counsel for [ms denys]: all right. did [ms denys] accompany you to look at that first house? [mr kellett]: no. counsel for [ms denys]: well, she – see, she has given evidence about looking at houses together. you dispute that, i take it? [mr kellett]: she came to the – the one that i purchased. she came over, and she came and looked through with me, yes. counsel for [ms denys]: well, why is she looking at a house with you? why are you looking at a house together? [mr kellett]: because she was a friend. counsel for [ms denys]: i see. you didn’t look at any houses with other friends, did you? [mr kellett]: the first house, i went with my son – we looked at that together. counsel for [ms denys]: yes? [mr kellett]: and he had to go to work, so [ms denys] came over in the afternoon, and we saw the second house – the second house on that day.[25]
counsel for [ms denys]: ... that clearly was your evidence that [ms denys] inspected the house with you? [mr kellett]: i don’t recall, i don’t recall her coming, no. counsel for [ms denys]: well, why did you give evidence that she did? [mr kellett]: it was after i purchased it, she wanted to have a look at the house before she gave me the money. counsel for [ms denys]: no, that’s not my question sir? [mr kellett]: o sorry. counsel for [ms denys]: why do you give evidence that she attended with you? [mr kellett]: she didn’t attend the initial um... his honour: that’s not an answer to the question either [mr kellett]? [mr kellett]: alright, ask me the question again please. counsel for [ms denys]: yes, why did you give evidence that she attended to inspect the house with you? [mr kellett]: i must have made a mistake. counsel for [ms denys]: it was a very detailed account of what happened, about your son attending in the morning and [ms denys] coming over in the afternoon, wasn’t it? [mr kellett]: yes, i suppose so. counsel for [ms denys]: so, do you concede now that [ms denys] did attend at that inspection? [mr kellett]: i have to concede she did, and i probably... i wasn’t a hundred per cent sure, but now you’re sort of painting the picture, i can, you know, recall it now. she did come, but she had no input to what house i liked, or whatever, she just trailed behind me.
the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life
i cooked sometimes, i’d say probably a high percentage of washing up is what i did, setting the table, and also making salads, these types of things. because i know you that you actually love having barbeques, i know you absolutely love barbeques, love them. so you liked being the chef, that’s what you enjoyed doing. you liked being the chef, getting the food cooked and prepared, and i would just help on the periphery. i would just check to make sure everything had been turned on and off, and then i’d wash up. that was actually a very regular occurrence, doing the washing up.
yes, just next door to each other in fact. and we’d sit down and we’d watch tv. we’d look at each other and have a drink together, and we’d sit there and watch telly.
whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship
the care and support of children
the reputation and public aspects of the relationship
other circumstances   mr kellett put to ms denys that he “would continually say” to ms denys that she lived in a bubble. ms denys gave evidence that he used to say to her “you are my bubble” because she looked after him. ms m gave unchallenged evidence, which i accept, that she asked mr kellett if ms denys made him happy, to which he replied that she is “my bubble in the world” or words to that effect, which she understood to be mr kellett’s affectionate term for ms denys.[32] (b) mr kellett asked ms denys whether she had a spending problem while she was living with him. she denied that she did. mr kellett enquired whether she went out to shops “day in, day out”. she gave evidence that she would go twice or three times per week. she gave oral evidence that she jokingly said to him that she was born to shop. mr kellett also asked ms denys’ witnesses about ms denys’ spending habits. (c) mr kellett put to ms denys that he used to say to her that she was the laziest person he knew. ms denys agreed that he did. (d) ms denys gave evidence that mr kellett asked her to give up cigarettes if she loved him. she gave evidence she did so, but remained a social smoker. mr kellett put to ms denys that he caught her smoking by the side of the house, which ms denys accepted may have happened once. ms l gave unchallenged evidence that when she visited the suburb b home between 2015 and 2020, mr kellett used to tell ms denys to stop smoking. these interactions are consistent with parties living together as a couple.   mr kellett asked ms denys whether she had a spending problem while she was living with him. she denied that she did. mr kellett enquired whether she went out to shops “day in, day out”. she gave evidence that she would go twice or three times per week. she gave oral evidence that she jokingly said to him that she was born to shop. mr kellett also asked ms denys’ witnesses about ms denys’ spending habits.

yes, i don’t gamble. you agree you asked me to buy things from the [discount] shop for yourself, for the house. i mean the jumper you’ve got on, i bought that for you, the jumper you’re wearing. i gave that to you, from the [discount] shop. it was two dollar jumper. so the jumper you’re wearing now, i bought for you from a [discount] shop. and you always wear it, it’s your favourite jumper. who bought it? i did. and the shirt as well, i gave to you for your birthday. so the shirt you’re wearing now... [indistinct]. so i don’t, i didn’t buy a shirt or a jumper, um, landlord. so i bought those because i loved you, i love you, and i care about you, i cared about you. what i’m saying is that yes, i certainly did buy that jumper that you’re wearing, and also the shirt that you’re wearing too. and, i bought those for you for the simple fact that i loved you. so, you know, i didn’t go and buy those types of clothes for a landlord, did i? would i do such a thing? i would think not.
