sabato & rimas [2023] fedcfamc2f 1207
orders
the court declares that:
reasons for judgment
judge glass:
evidentiary issues
circumstances of the relationship
the duration of the relationship
solicitor for [mr sabato]: are you aware of the fact that the relationship does not exist now? [mr j]: yes, i am. solicitor for [mr sabato]: okay. how did you find it out? [mr j]: well, that particular weekend in 2021 ... on the way back from [town b] back to [town h], [ms rimas] told me that she was breaking up with him and i said, “fair enough.” well, four weeks after that, i went back to fix the fence. i took my [car] up and i took [ms rimas] and her daughter with me. i had all the materials to fix the fence and the tools. and then [mr sabato] told me later in the day, not at the start, that they had broken up, so i’m going to say they’ve broken up. (emphasis added)
counsel for [ms rimas]: ... my client’s instructions are that, after the visit in 2021, she said words to the effect of, “i’m not going back there,” or, “i’m never going back there,” rather than, “i’ve broken up with him”, is it possible that that’s what was said? [mr j]: no. she said to me she broke up with while we drove back from [town h] – from [town b] to [town h]. counsel for [ms rimas]: okay? [mr j]: she did say that. counsel for [ms rimas]: yes? [mr j]: she did – also said what you said at [town h].
i hope you are both well! [mr sabato] and i are no longer things over the years have been difficult! too he was seeing an ex girlfriend in melbourne (3 years ago) i found out! [mr sabato] has told me untruths over the years, also i know he has told people that ‘[town b]’ is his where the reality is i paid for it with my money (i sold land in [town k]) [mr sabato] has never been able to ‘save’ he is not good with money! [mr sabato] has been paying me a small rent of $75 a week for staying there! as living with him was very hard! but always remember i have much fondness for you both and take care. i wish [mr sabato] well too, but i need to move on.[12] (emphasis added)
i understand [mr sabato] has asked to borrow money for [town b] last week. i said to [mr sabato] i can not look after two houses also ‘[town b]’ is getting neglected he doesn’t look after it and the pollution of his smoking is staining everything walls, doors furniture so i said “i am selling” he was not happy and then ‘blackmailed’ me for money when i sell! even though i paid for this myself, he pays me a small rent. but i will pay him for the hot water service he did pay for, i did not know he did this until later (after the fact) as i would of dealt with getting a new one. he said he was to ask you as he wants [town b], he like living there if i sell to him ‘cheap’ he will leave me alone. then i can walk away hopefully in peace.[13]
the nature and extent of the parties’ common residence
we continued our romantic relationship despite living under separate roofs. i would stay with [ms rimas] at the [town g] property on the weekends that [l] stayed at [mr c]'s and on the alternate weekends [ms rimas] and [l] would stay with me at the [town b] property.[20]
over the years i had regular telephone calls with [mr sabato]. [ms rimas] or her daughter would often answer the phone when i rang and then pass the phone on to [mr sabato] to talk to me.[22]
whether a sexual relationship existed
the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between the parties
counsel for [ms rimas]: when did you have the discussion that gave rise to this agreement, after your medical episode? [mr sabato]: no, this happened way, way before. before we – before we got the property. she told me straight out she couldn’t afford it, but we would get one – one under the thing that i pay the mortgage and when we split up, we go fifty-fifty.
the ownership, use and acquisition of the parties’ property
her agreement was whatever i put in, i get out. whatever it was, 30 grand, i think, at the time, or 40,000. i can’t remember exactly. and then, profit after that. like hypothetically she put in 30,000. the property sold for 100,000. so i would only get property of – settlement of 60,000. you understand? not the whole 100,000 because she would be taking out x amount of what she initially put in.
well, i have repainted, i have put carpets, i have done a hot water service, i have done a heater, [flooring], roofing. there’s so many other things that i can’t – you know, like, bits that are broken that i have fixed or that i have replaced or whatever.
when asked about the town h property in re-examination he gave evidence that he “had done many, many renovations or fixing of certain things on both the [town g] and [town h] property as well”.
the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life
i didn’t really like the idea, but i did it, because i thought, well, if there’s a problem with my rental property up there, i would probably be the easiest person to go into either [town g] centrelink or [town n] to explain the situation, like if he was hospitalised or things like that, because his family were so far away in melbourne. ... i thought, well, it would probably be a lot easier for me to do considering he was my tenant and i would have to sort of get those formalities in place as well if i had to by centrelink.
i’m not sure because – because of the fact that, from week to week, it used to change and i wasn’t allowed – i wasn’t aware whether i could travel and get food or whether i could – because we’ve only got one small supermarket in [town b]. all the bigger shops and clothes and stuff like that were in [town n], which is [10] kilometres away. so i wasn’t aware – and you would go to the police officer, “can i travel?” and they said, “we don’t know.” so there’s...no point in me risking getting a fine or – during that time.
whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship
the care and support of children
the reputation and public aspects of the relationship
other circumstances
...the reason behind that document is due to the fact – when a couple are together in centrelink’s eyes, they get a reduced amount of income. when they’re apart but living – like, de facto but living in separate addresses, they get a substantial amount more. so that’s why we’ve done it. ... we were getting more money, but we weren’t doing any wrong legally, or whatever you want to call it.
