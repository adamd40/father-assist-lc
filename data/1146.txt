standard of proof   in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities.

credit of the parties ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... [citations omitted]  ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (“carlson”) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case:  5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... [169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide.  ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.

reasonable practicality   in determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child’s parents, the court must have regard to:   how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and   the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and   the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and
consent orders (6) if: (a) the court is considering whether to make a parenting order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings, and (b) the order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child,   the court is considering whether to make a parenting order with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings, and (b) the order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child,   the order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child,
the court may, but is not required to, consider the matters referred to in paragraphs (1)(a) to (c) or (if applicable) the matters referred to in paragraphs (2)(c) to (e).   to avoid doubt, subsection (6) does not affect the application of section 60ca in relation to a parenting order.
... 65dac effect of parenting order that provides for shared parental responsibility (1) this section applies if, under a parenting order:   2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child, and (b) the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long‑term issue in relation to the child.   the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long‑term issue in relation to the child.   the order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons. (3) the order is taken to require each of those persons: (a) to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and   to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and   to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.

parental responsibility 1] the position is, then, it seems to me, that an order allocating parenting responsibility can be applied for by a non-parent concerned in the care welfare and development of the child and an order can be made between two or more persons including persons who are not a parent. however, the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility applies only as between parents.
a. [the second respondent] has had virtually no involvement in [x]’s life. [the father] has effectively acted as [x]’s father throughout most of [x]’s life. [the second respondent] does not seek any parenting orders in relation to [x], nor did he participate in the interview with the family consultant. [the father] and [the mother] agree that they should share parental responsibility in relation to [x], and [x] will benefit from this.

the preferred approach ] in (hickey) at [39] the full court, in setting out what the case law revealed as the “preferred approach” to the determination of an application under s 79 of the act, referred to four inter-related steps, including that “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of ss. 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”...  ] the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application pursuant to the provisions of section 79. that approach involves four interrelated steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (“the other factors”) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

the robb and robb issue
in considering whether the justice of a case requires some act done by a party to be taken into account under s. 75(2)(o), the court should, we think, have regard primarily to the existence or otherwise of any legal obligations, as between the parties, in relation to the doing of that act, and also, perhaps, to ordinary notions of justice and equity between the parties. in this case, the wife had a legal duty to maintain the children of her prior marriage, which duty had primacy over the duty of any other person, other than the children's father, to so maintain them: ss. 66a and 66b of the act. the husband, on the other hand, had no legal duty to maintain these children at any time during the marriage because, by s. 66g, a step-parent has such a duty only if he or she is a guardian of the child, or has custody of the child by an order of a court, or a court having jurisdiction under part vii of the act by order determines that it is proper for the step-parent to have that duty. none of those preconditions existed in this case. accordingly, in contributing to the support of these children the wife was merely honouring a legal obligation which she owed to the children, whilst the husband, in making his contribution, was acting essentially as a volunteer assisting the wife in the discharge of her legal obligations. upon that basis, whilst we consider the justice of the case clearly required the husband's contribution to be taken into account under s. 75(2)(o), the same cannot be said of the wife's contribution...in making that contribution the wife was in no way discharging or assisting to discharge any legal obligation of the husband. [emphasis added]
52. this ground of appeal is not established.
conclusion as to section 90sf(3) factors adjustment.
...in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue.
on our adjusted figure for the value of the parties net assets ($1,503,863), adjustment of 10% in the wife’s favour results in an increase in her entitlement of $150,386, and a corresponding reduction in the husband’s entitlement, producing a differential movement between them of $300,772 ...  7] it is also important to recall what was said in phipson & phipson [2009] famcafc 28 when the full court was dealing with another appeal from the trial judge in the present proceedings:  ] it is always important to keep in mind that an adjustment of x% for s 75(2) factors leads to a disparity in the value of property received by the parties representing 2 x x%. it is that disparity, measured in “money terms”, that requires consideration in determining whether the result is just and equitable: see campbell v kuskey [1998] famca 10, (1998) flc 92-795 at 84,928.  8] the 10% adjustment his honour made on account of s 75(2) factors has led to a disparity in favour of the wife equivalent in value to 20% of the assets. in money terms this represents $187,733 out of a total asset pool of $938,665. apart from the issues associated with the care, accommodation and maintenance of the children, the s 75(2) factors largely balanced out (save that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife would have more capital than the husband). the husband was going to have whatever responsibility remained for the care, accommodation and maintenance of [x]. both parties would have significant responsibility for the two younger children. it is true the wife will have the children with her about 20% more of the time than the husband, but this amounts to only a little more than 70 additional days a year. [109] in our view an assessment leading to a disparity of $187,733 in the capital/superannuation to be received by each party was outside the reasonable ambit of the trial judge’s broad discretion, even taking into account the matters found by his honour relating to the non-payment of child support in the period after the husband gave up his employment. our conclusion is sufficient to enliven appellate intervention (house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513). the appeal will therefore be allowed. ... [112] in our view, given that the children will be with him around 40% of the time, the husband’s accommodation needs for the children would not be significantly different to those of the wife. however, in light of the agreement in relation to child support, we accept that the wife will bear the greater proportion of the burden of maintaining the two younger children (at least for the time being). the husband, on the other hand, will have whatever responsibility remains for accommodating and maintaining [x]. the others 75(2) factors, in our view, are evenly balanced, save for the fact that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife will have 4% (or $37,546) more of the assets/superannuation than the husband. [113] taking these matters into account, and the failure of the husband to pay child support after giving up his employment, we consider there should be a 4% adjustment for s 75(2) factors, creating a disparity of 8% between the parties – or in money terms an amount of $75,093.  9] in our view, s 79(4)(e) requires those matters to be taken into account in arriving at orders that are just and equitable as between the parties. in arriving at an appropriate assessment for those factors, a dollar value of it should be uppermost in our minds [79] and, of course, the ultimate disparity in entitlements which it might produce. that dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests in property of the parties.
