reasons for judgment
judge glass:
spend time
a person (the respondent) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to spend time with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not spending time together as provided for in the order if:   the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to spend time together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child), and (b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).   the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a).
count 1  late] 2022 [z] disclosed to me that "i accidentally stepped on dad's foot" and "dad got angry and hit me across the head' and "he shoved me into the wall”. [z] complained of having a "sore head”. [y] confirmed [z]'s version of events, saying "dad was angry because [z] stood on his foot. dad's face went red, he yelled and swore and hit [z]'s head and [z]'s head went into the wall." [in late] 2022, [ms b] spoke to me about [z]'s disclosure and told me "[z]'s told me [mr corbin] struck him, have you heard about this?" i said, "yes." i then explained to [ms b] what [z] had said to me. [ms b] is a [community worker]. she said "i'm going to make a report to [...]".[4]
... going back to the mother’s state of mind or her reasonableness at the time that this occurred, all she knew was that the children made these disclosures to her and then to police, and then she received a caution or a copy of the caution where there’s an unspecified – sorry, an admission to clipping [z] over the head on an unspecified date.

count 4
on 14 october 2022, the children were due to spend three nights with me from after school pursuant to order 5.4.1 of the orders. at 2:11 pm i received a message from [ms corbin] stating:
"[x], [y] and [z] have chosen not to attend your house this weekend. as a first step at reconciliation how about we trial wednesday after school until thursday before school this week as a one night starting point. i will attach a medical certificate for this weekend".
at this time, [x] was aged 11, [y] was aged 10 and [z] was aged 7. it is my view that they were and are too young to decide whether or not to see me. at 4:20pm, [ms corbin] sent a medical certificate on talking parents for [x] only (not [y] and [z]), in the same terms as the previous certificates, covering the period 14 october 2022 until 17 october 2022. she did not make the children available to spend time with me that weekend. i did not receive any contact from [ms corbin] regarding make-up time. i called [dr d] that evening to ask why a medical certificate had been issued. [dr d] said "all three children presented for an appointment with [ms corbin] today. [x] presented with anxiety and said she didn't want to go, so i signed a medical certificate for her. the boys did not say that they didn't want to go, so i did not provide a medical certificate for them". he also said "[ms corbin] said that you didn't come to handover on 1 october 2022 which is why they didn't spend time with you on the holidays and that this caused the children anxiety". as outlined above, this is untrue and was very upsetting to me. i said to [dr d] "this is the fourth time you have provided a medical certificate for anxiety and depression with no referral for professional services. please can a referral be made.”[6] (emphasis added)
counts 6, 8 and 10 , however, has refused to and has not spent any time with [mr corbin] since [late] 2022. i have formed the view that [x]'s behaviour and her response when i have forced her to see her father was so distressing to [x] that it put [x]'s psychological well-being at risk. when i tell [x] that she needs to spend time with her father, she becomes hysterical, cries, and insists that she is not feeling well. [x] is well aware of the dates that she is schedule to spend with [mr corbin] and refuses to go to school on changeover dates. she does this by hiding at home, saying she 's unwell, and refusing to get into the car to go to school. to get [x] to go see her father i have to physically carry and drag her to [mr corbin]. i have done this to [x] in the past when she was younger. [x] was 7 to 9 years old during the previous proceedings, during which, to facilitate changeovers, i had to carry her, put her into the car and lock her in the car to drive her to see her father. even with this routine, i could not always get [x] to see her father and to avoid missing changeover times completely often left with just [y] and [z] and brought them to see their father. now that [x] is 12 years old and much bigger, i can no longer use physical force to bring [x] to school or changeovers against her wishes. [x] is now 150cm tall and approximately 45kg and i can no longer physically pick her up and carry her to the car.[7]

count 9
there was an occasion [in] november 2022 where [y] was dysregulated, so i did not provide [y] on that date. on that day, [y] was so stressed that he experienced an "autistic shutdown". he wrapped himself in his blanket and cuddled his dogs. [y] was unresponsive and i could not get through to him at this point.[11]
... [y] was particularly dysregulated [in] november 2022. this dysregulation was evidenced by [y] shutting down and wrapping himself around the dog, curled up in a ball and unable to process any communication from me.[12]
i collected [z] from school and started heading to [the] shops to collect [y]. before leaving the school carpark i received a message from [ms corbin’s] whatsapp at 3:19pm saying "i will not be attending you for the weekend. [y] ".[13]
communication
count 5
generally, i facilitate audio-visual contact between the children and [mr corbin] by giving one of the children my mobile phone during a whatsapp call from [mr corbin]. the other children are also at home during these calls. on 17 october 2022 at 6 :45pm, i facilitated an audio-visual call between the children and [mr corbin] via my whatsapp account. i gave the phone to [z] on this occasion and he had a call with [x]. [x] and [y] were also home but declined to speak to [mr corbin] that day. i say it is not reasonable for [mr corbin] to expect that all three children are present for every single audio-visual call between him and the children, which occur once per week. during the calls it is very difficult to get all three of them to engage at the same time, so i usually ask that one child holds the phone (or has it in front of them) and talks to their father. the children then take it in turns between them in accordance with their wishes. if one child wants to spend the entire time talking to [mr corbin] and this is ok with the other children, i do not take the phone away from that child and force the other two to speak to [mr corbin] instead.[15] (emphasis added)
counsel for [mr corbin]: you don’t tell us what you said to [x] and [y] that day. do you remember? [mr corbin]: not specifically on that occasion, but i know that i regularly prepare them before the phone call is about to start and let them know that it’s almost time to speak to dad, you know, “five minutes to go. finish up what you’re doing. come and get ready. dad is now on the phone. dad is talking to [z]. come and join the phone call” – that sort of thing. counsel for [mr corbin]: yes, yes, so you think, in general, that’s probably what happened on that occasion, but you’re not sure? [mr corbin]: yes, that’s – yes. counsel for [mr corbin]: okay. so you have no recollection of saying to them, “come and talk to your dad”? [mr corbin]: not – i don’t remember that day specifically, but i know that that is what i always say to them. counsel for [mr corbin]: yes. so, certainly with [y], if you look back at that time, you could have convinced him to come and talk to his dad, couldn’t you? [mr corbin]: that’s really variable, as my son has autism spectrum disorder and he has really good days and he has not so good days. counsel for [mr corbin]: and [x] – once again, you have no recollection of that particular date? [mr corbin]: not that specific date, no.
counts 3 and 7
i do not recall exactly what happened [in] october 2022 but recall that it was on the children’s first day back at school, [mr corbin] called twice, and i spent a long period of time after [mr corbin]’s first call telling the children to pick up the phone and speak to their father. i put the phone in front of them and said "it's dad on the phone. please answer". they refused. i note that this was about 2 weeks after [mr corbin]’s assault of [z]. i say it is not possible to force the children to engage in the audio-visual calls if they refuse to talk to [mr corbin]. even if i pick up the call and place the phone in front of the children, if they do not want to speak to [mr corbin] they would refuse to talk, hang up the phone or leave the room. i note [mr corbin] deposes at paragraph 14 of his affidavit he has missed 130 of 160 audio-visual calls with the children. i deny that figure and say that i have encouraged the children to participate in all of the calls pursuant to the orders and that the children have participated in the majority of those calls. i say that there were less than 10 calls which all of the children missed.[18]
i do not recall exactly what happened [in] october 2022 but recalled that [mr corbin] called twice and i was not successful in convincing any of the children in picking up the phone.[19]
