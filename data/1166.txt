overview
to property proceedings[2] filed against the respondent de-facto wife, ms brisset (‘the wife’).
background and chronology
noting but for the declarations [ms brisset] would be within the definition of general beneficiaries and specified beneficiary by virtue of being a child of [mr g] and [ms m]. the consent of appointer at clauses 4 (b) and (c) of the deed of variation made in accordance with clause 10 of the trustee deed pursuant to the provisions of section 106b of the act the disposition of one (1) share by [ms brisset] in [h company] now known as [d] proprietary limited to [mr c] on or about 30 march 2021 be set aside. subject to the court making an order in terms of paragraph 1 and/or 2 of these orders, [mr c] in his capacity as sole director/secretary of [d] proprietary limited do all things necessary including, but not limited to, signing all documents and provide all consents necessary to give effect to paragraph 1 and/or 2 of these orders.
documents relied upon
the application to summarily dismiss the husband’s applications made pursuant to s106b.
... i was aware of [mr c]’s intentions to remove me completely from the [brisset family trust]. i have been aware of this since soon after i became a director and shareholder of [h company]. actually thought [mr c] had already done that in 2018/2019 when [j pty ltd] sold and resigned as a director of the [brisset family trust] trustee company. i disagree that i am disadvantaged by the variation. as i see it i had no entitlement or expectation to anything more of the [brisset family trust]. i had received "my share" which far exceeded what little i had done towards my family business and for that i am very satisfied. i did not receive any distributions directly from the [brisset family trust]. the only payment i have received was for the payout of the loan balance in the [brisset family trust].
51.1. the parties evidence demonstrates: distributions of taxable income to beneficiaries are reported on their tax return in the financial year the trustee resolves that a distribution is made. the amounts are not reported on the beneficiary’s tax return when they actually received the money. 51.2. as to [mr c]’s comments at [10] of his affidavit generally: no explanation is provided as to why [ms brisset]’s assistance with tax minimisation was no longer needed in and after 2020. if it was always [mr c]’s intention to pay her the distributions, then how can her role be said to be “for legitimate tax minimisation”? the 2020 income tax returns would have been due for lodgement in may 2021. this coincides with when [ms brisset] says the parties’ separated. if [ms brisset]’s role in the earlier years was purely to be a tax minimiser, no explanation is provided as to how the tax on those amounts get paid in those years when there were not monetary distributions to her. the terms of the trust do, however allow for distributions to be made to her to pay tax subject to her not being part of the excluded class. [mr c] specifically refers to payments made “directly” to [ms brisset] and says no payments were made directly to her from 2020. it is not clear if [mr c] intends to convey that indirect payments have been made. such payments would be those to [ms brisset]’s related entities and that not reportable in her own personal tax returns. it is submitted [ms brisset]’s tax returns would not show cash distributions made to her where such payments are not taxable income of the trust and, therefore, not taxable income in [ms brisset]’s hands, as a taxpayer. such distributions could conceivably include:
a. trust corpus. b. asset revaluation reserves. c. realised gain reserves. tax free capital gains (from the sale of assets acquired prior to september 1985). capital gain discounts (the 50% of a capital gain which is not taxable if the asset has been held for longer than twelve months).
summary dismissal –the law   the court may make a decree for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of the proceedings if: (a) the first party is prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings, and (b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.   the first party is prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings, and (b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.   the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.   a party may apply for summary orders after a response has been filed if the party claims, in relation to the application or response, that:   the court has no jurisdiction, or (b) the other party has no legal capacity to apply for the orders sought, or (c) it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process, or (d) there is no reasonable likelihood of success.
16. further, the plurality said: the determination of the issue must only take into account the material on which the respondent seeks to make out the case, or as often expressed takes the respondent’s case “at its highest” unless the respondent’s version is inherently incredible or unreliable (see munnings v australian government solicitor [1994] hca 65, (1994) 68 aljr 169 at 171, bigg & suzi [1998] famca 14, (1998) flc 92-799, webster v lampard [1993] hca 57, (1993) 177 clr 598 at 608). ... the primary judge at [53] also correctly referred to and cited from the judgment of kirby j in lindon v commonwealth (no 2) [1996] hca 14, (1996) 136 alr 251 at 255–256, where his honour set out the approach to be taken in applications for summary relief, namely: it is a serious matter to deprive a person of access to the courts of law for it is there that the rule of law is upheld, including against government and other powerful interests. this is why relief, whether under o 26, r 18 or in the inherent jurisdiction of the court, is rarely and sparingly provided. to secure such relief, the party seeking it must show that it is clear, on the face of the opponent's documents, that the opponent lacks a reasonable cause of action or is advancing a claim that is clearly frivolous or vexatious. an opinion of the court that a case appears weak and such that it is unlikely to succeed is not, alone, sufficient to warrant summary termination. even a weak case is entitled to the time of a court. experience teaches that the concentration of attention, elaborated evidence and argument and extended time for reflection will sometimes turn an apparently unpromising cause into a successful judgment. summary relief of the kind provided for by o 26, r 18, for absence of a reasonable cause of action, is not a substitute for proceeding by way of demurrer. if there is a serious legal question to be determined, it should ordinarily be determined at a trial for the proof of facts may sometimes assist the judicial mind to understand and apply the law that is invoked and to do so in circumstances more conducive to deciding a real case involving actual litigants rather than one determined on imagined or assumed facts. if, notwithstanding the defects of pleadings, it appears that a party may have a reasonable cause of action which it has failed to put in proper form, a court will ordinarily allow that party to reframe its pleading. a question has arisen as to whether o 26, r 18 applies to part only of a pleading. however, it is unnecessary in this case to consider that question because the commonwealth's attack was upon the entirety of mr lindon's statement of claim. the guiding principle is, as stated in o 26, r 18(2), doing what is just. if it is clear that proceedings within the concept of the pleading under scrutiny are doomed to fail, the court should dismiss the action to protect the defendant from being further troubled, to save the plaintiff from further costs and disappointment and to relieve the court of the burden of further wasted time which could be devoted to the determination of claims which have legal merit. (footnotes omitted) ... in wood v glaxo australia pty ltd [1993] qca 114, [1994] 2 qd r 431, an appeal against a refusal to order an extension of the period of limitation within which an action might be instituted, macrossan cj relevantly said at 434:
...it is nevertheless recognised as wrong to place potential plaintiffs in anything like a situation where they must on the probabilities show that it is likely they will succeed in their actions. a judge may harbour a feeling that there is a strong chance that particular applicants will fail at trial but, in my opinion, he should not act on the basis of this impression both because that is a question reserved for another occasion and because he cannot know and should not insist on being able to see in all of its ramifications the full strength of the case which will eventually be presented at trial. ... a similar approach is to be taken in applications for summary dismissal. the court does not undertake a preliminary trial, nor is a detailed hearing of the case on its merits required. (emphasis added)
consideration
the beneficiary of a non-exhaustive discretionary trust who does not control the trustee directly or indirectly has a right to due consideration and to due administration of the trust but it is difficult to value those rights when the beneficiary has no present entitlement and may never have any entitlement to any part of the income or capital of the trust. (emphasis added) in the present case, there was no evidence presented to the primary judge as to what the value of such a right to “due consideration and due administration” would be.[6] in the absence of evidence of any such value of the interest held by the first respondent, the primary judge, appropriately, in our view, excluded the trust property from the property pool but had regard to the trust assets as being a significant financial resource available to the first respondent. no error has been demonstrated on the part of the primary judge in taking that approach. in that respect, in shaw and shaw [1989] famca 29, (1989) flc 92-030 at 77,420, the full court said there was “a degree of artificiality about attempting to assign a monetary value” to a financial resource in circumstances where it was not possible to identify future events or decisions that would result in the financial resource being accessed by the party. a similar view was expressed by aldridge j in raine & creed [2013] famca 362 at [33]. for completeness, we make it clear that this case is not analogous to the facts of kennon v spry and we caution against giving the principles adumbrated in that case a legend beyond what were described as the “unusual circumstances” of that case (per kiefel j at [237] and french cj at [62]). (emphasis added)
the husband’s application to join mr c and the corporate trustee.
44.1 the proposed respondents "may be directly affected by an issue in a proceeding". [mr frederic] seeks to set aside the 16 june 2023 deed of variation and resignation. [mr frederic] seeks to set aside [ms brisset’s] share transfer. the owner of that share is presently [mr c]. both [ms brisset] and [mr c] hold a belief the trust is solely [mr c’s]. [ms brisset] refers to the trust as "his trust" (ie. [mr c]'s trust). [mr c] says the trust "has always been my entity" and says he "treated it as such". such a view runs contrary to the purpose of the trust and its terms noted in preamble to the trust deed at (a). 44.2 the proposed respondents "participation in this proceeding is necessary" for the court to determine all issues in dispute in the proceeding because if the proposed respondents are not joined, they will not be bound by the outcome determined by the court. put another way, if not a party, the proposed respondents are free to disregard whatever order is made by this court after trial.
joinder - the law
10. the following are entitled to become a party to proceedings in which an application is made for an order under this section by a party to a marriage (the subject marriage ):
... any other person whose interests would be affected by the making of the order.
3.01. necessary parties
a person whose rights may be directly affected by an issue in a proceeding, and whose participation as a party is necessary for the court to determine all issues in dispute in the proceeding, must be included as a party to the proceeding.
where the orders sought, establish or recognise a proprietary or security interest in land, chattels or a monetary fund, all persons who have a claim or interest in the subject matter are necessary parties. this is because an order in favour of the claimant will, to a corresponding extent, be detrimental to all others who have or claim an interest. it does not matter whether a proposed party wishes to participate in a proceeding: arida v arida [2015] nswca 170, per sackville aja at [19] (with bell p and macfarlan ja agreeing). it is well settled that, applying these principles, it can be appropriate to join third parties to a marriage to proceedings in this court, for example, to bind them in respect of declarations as to property interests pursuant to s 78 or as ancillary to the exercise of discretion in s 79 or s 106b to set aside dispositions: valceski v valceski [2007] nswsc 440, (2007) 70 nswlr 36 at [31]–[33], khalif & khalif (no 2) [2021] fedcfamc1f 308 at [37]. clearly, according to these principles, the existence of claims for orders affecting the rights or interests of third parties proposed to be joined usually compels the conclusion that those parties are “necessary”. such joinder is, nonetheless, an exercise of the court’s discretion. (emphasis added)
...something more than “useful” or “expeditious”. in my view, if there are available alternative means to joinder to the substantive proceedings, of obtaining from a third person or someone already a party what is needed to allow an applicant for joinder to establish an identified “case”, joinder is unlikely to be “necessary”. however, if a cause of action, recognisable at law, against a “third person” is particularised, then it is at least highly likely that joinder will be “necessary for the court to completely and finally determine all matters in dispute.” in hancock family memorial foundation ltd v fieldhouse [no 3] [2010] wasc 223, le miere j helpfully referred to relevant authorities and articulated, in precise terms, why it is necessary for a party seeking to join a third party to litigation to establish an arguable case, in the following terms: the applicant on a joinder application must show that there is an arguable case sufficient to resist the entry of summary judgment by the parties sought to be joined. it would be futile to order that a person be joined as a defendant if the material before the court disclosed that if the person, having been joined as a defendant, applied for summary judgment the application would succeed. (citations omitted)(emphasis added) the full court in b pty ltd and ors & k and anor [2008] famcafc 113, (2008) flc 93-380 held as follows: we do not accept that it is proper to allow joinder of third parties merely upon the formulation of a paragraph in, or to be added to, an application, on the basis that at trial facts to support the application may be asserted and proved. sufficient facts must be asserted to demonstrate that, if proved, the law arguably provides the relief sought.
