primary considerations
about three minutes onto this phone call, the [father] told the representative that he was going to go to the [mother’s] residence and take his money back. he told the service representative “i will fucking [hurt] her ... i will [hurt her] and [harm myself]”. the [d authority] officer further confirmed with the [father] that he meant if they were to take more child support from him, he would go to the [mother’s] residence and take it back and [hurt] her. the [father] confirmed this as his intention. about six minutes into this phone call, the [father] made further threats to the [d authority], stating “i am going to [hurt] you. i am going to [hurt] you. i will bend you over and [hurt] you”. this conversation continued with the [father] continuously threatening both the [mother] and the [d authority] officer. after about 15 minutes, the phone call was transferred to a social worker for further assistance. the [father] continued his threatening behaviour and told the support worker that he would [hurt] her and himself. the [father] told the social worker that he had [a weapon] and was outside the [mother’s] residence and would attack police if confronted. the social worker became fearful for the [mother’s] safety as well as her own and notified a coworker of the incident immediately. this co-worker called police, informing them he was at the [mother’s] residence. a short time later, police attended the residence but were unable to locate the [father]. due to the nature of the threats and the belief that the [mother] was armed and intending to cause harm to the [father], an extensive search of the surrounding area was conducted. the [father] was unable to be located so a triangulation was conducted on the [father’s] phone. at [5:00] pm, this triangulation showed the [father] was near the intersection of [e & f streets] in [suburb g]. this location is known to be close to the [father’s] work address at ‘[h company]’ at [j street, suburb g]. (annexure “b” to the mother’s affidavit filed 19 september 2023)
so fucken what you dumb whore, i will be dropping him off at 9am as that is the start of school, anyhow ... go fuck yourself with a piece of rusty barbed wire [middle finger emoji] (as per the original)
because i continue to receive ransom letters every month from the mafia as directed by the gold digging whore that you are, i have decided to remove all special privileges and entertainment that would normally be given to the children, and l have been in full discussion with the children that you are the direct cause of this change ... i am happy to enter into a private arrangement to make this situation fair that’s right fucken fair you mafia cunts ...... yes its a swear word ... get over it. (as per the original)
dad said if you do not cancel child support payments, he is going to sell everything [the brother] and i own and make our lives hell and i don’t think he was kidding. (as per the original)
