legal principles  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of his parents, and (b) the need to ensure that the child is protected from harm - both physical and psychological harm – which may arise if the child concerned is exposed to any kind of abuse, neglect and family violence.   the need to ensure that the child is protected from harm - both physical and psychological harm – which may arise if the child concerned is exposed to any kind of abuse, neglect and family violence.
assessment of risk
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.
it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children’s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children’s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s ability to care for the children.
relocation
whilst the statutory framework does not deal differently or specifically with cases involving a proposed relocation from other parenting cases, such cases attract the description of “relocation cases” because they bring into sharp focus the central issue of balancing statutory imperatives concerning children’s best interests in the context of the legitimate and competing interests of parents. the task is to achieve, by the application of the law, orders which are legitimate by reference to both “best interests” considerations and the rights of parents, including a right to choose where the parent lives. in some cases, the determination of “best interests” may well mean that one party’s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child’s “best interests” being served by orders which do not give one parent “optimal” arrangements or outcomes.[40]
