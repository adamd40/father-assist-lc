the applicable legal principles
3.01 necessary parties a person whose rights may be directly affected by an issue in a proceeding, and whose participation as a party is necessary for the court to determine all issues in dispute in the proceeding, must be included as a party to the proceeding.
“we do not accept that it is proper to allow joinder of third parties merely upon the formulation of a paragraph in, or to be added to, an application, on the basis that at trial facts to support the application may be asserted and proved. sufficient facts must be asserted to demonstrate that, if proved, the law arguably provides the relief sought.”
