power of the court to make a costs order
“in considering what order, if any, should be made under subsection (2), the court will have regard to: (a) the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, (b) whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings, including - without limiting the generality of the foregoing - the conduct of the parties in relation to the pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admission of the facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by a failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with the previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”   the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, (b) whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings, including - without limiting the generality of the foregoing - the conduct of the parties in relation to the pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admission of the facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by a failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with the previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”   whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings, including - without limiting the generality of the foregoing - the conduct of the parties in relation to the pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admission of the facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by a failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with the previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”   the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings, including - without limiting the generality of the foregoing - the conduct of the parties in relation to the pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admission of the facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by a failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with the previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”   whether the proceedings were necessitated by a failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with the previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”   whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”   whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”   any such other matters as the court considers relevant.”
“(3) to avoid doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children's lawyer in respect of the proceedings.   however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if: (a) a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,   a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,   the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,
the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children's lawyer.  ) [omitted]   in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2) in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer has been appointed, the court must disregard the fact that the independent children's lawyer is funded under a legal aid scheme or service established under a commonwealth, state or territory law or approved by the attorney-general.”
... while i am satisfied there is merit in making an order against the mother that she pay one-half of the costs as sought by the icl, i am also satisfied that i am prevented by s.117(4) from doing so because she is “a party to the proceedings [who] has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings”. whether this was the policy intent of the parliament when it amended this provision in 2003 is a moot point and not one upon which this court proposes to comment further. that said, i am satisfied that had the costs order sought against the mother been legally possible, she would not suffer financial hardship ...
in construing the subsection it should be observed that the operative circumstance is unqualified. it does not suggest that the party must currently be in receipt of legal aid, or in receipt of legal aid for a particular portion of the proceedings. it is expressed simply in the past tense.
... in relation to both the mother and the father in these proceedings, whether, considering the provisions of subs (2a), an order for the independent children’s lawyer’s costs to be paid by the father or the mother or both the father and the mother should be considered just[1]
quantum of costs payable
unless legal aid nsw waives a party’s liability to pay a contribution towards the costs of the independent children’s lawyer, [the icl] must apply to the court for cost orders. if [the icl] are of the view that an application for costs should not be made in the circumstances of the matter [the icl] should contact legal aid grants and seek approval not to proceed with an application for costs.
... seek an initial contribution towards their costs from the parties to proceedings (currently $1,650 each where there are two parties). when the initial contribution is sought, the parties are provided with the icl’s costs estimate and are put on notice that the icl intends to seek a costs order at the conclusion of proceedings.
