declaration of interests in property  after the breakdown of the de facto relationship, and (b) with respect to existing title or rights in respect of property, the court may declare the title or rights, if any, that a party has in respect of the property.   if a court makes a declaration under subsection (1), it may make consequential orders to give effect to the declaration, including orders as to sale or partition and interim or permanent orders as to possession.
applicable legal principles  ] first, it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. ......... the question posed by s 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order. ... [39] because the power to make a property settlement order is not to be exercised in an unprincipled fashion, whether it is "just and equitable" to make the order is not to be answered by assuming that the parties' rights to or interests in marital property are or should be different from those that then exist. ........ questions between husband and wife about the ownership of property that may be then, or may have been in the past, enjoyed in common are to be "decided according to the same scheme of legal titles and equitable principles as govern the rights of any two persons who are not spouses.” (citation omitted) the question presented by s 79 is whether those rights and interests should be altered. [40] third, whether making a property settlement order is "just and equitable" is not to be answered by beginning from the assumption that one or other party has the right to have the property of the parties divided between them or has the right to an interest in marital property which is fixed by reference to the various matters (including financial and other contributions) set out in s 79 (4). the power to make a property settlement order must be exercised "in accordance with legal principles, including the principles which the act itself lays down". to conclude that making an order is "just and equitable" only because of and by reference to various matters in s 79(4), without a separate consideration of s 79(2), would be to conflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles laid down by the act.  ] provided the discretion is exercised judicially, it is at large, it is neither possible nor desirable to specify its ‘metes and bounds’ (stanford at [36]-[40] and [46]). recognition is given to the fact that the circumstances of individual marriages (their nature, form and characteristics) can and do differ and those differences – the way in the which the parties have organised and lived their marriage/relationship – may be relevant to the exercise of the s 90sm(3)/s 79(2) discretion. equally, provided that the questions required by s 90sm(3)/s 79(2) and s 90sm(4)/s 79(4) are seen as separate and applied as such, and not conflated, the enumerated factors within s 90sm(4)/s 79(4) can inform the s 90sm(3)/s 79(2) discretion together with any such other considerations as are properly relevant (see, stanford at [40]). [13] as a result of those matters, the court’s approach to s 79/s 90sm may be less compartmentalised than what a strict or unthinking adherence to four (or three) “steps” might otherwise reveal. the task is essentially holistic, is it just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the particular relationship or marriage under consideration to make an order and, if so, its terms must similarly meet that criteria. of course, holistic though the approach is, it must be referenced to what the act requires and care must be taken to ensure that the court’s reasons make that clear. (see, for example, davut & raif [1994] famca 113, (1994) flc 92-503 at 81,237).
all financial and non-financial contributions are to be evaluated relative to that of the other party with such weight as the court determines, since precise valuation of contributions is impossible: kessey & kessey [1994] famca 162, (1994) flc 92-495 at 81,151, contributions are to be assessed between commencement of the relationship and trial, and measured not only in terms of assets that presently still exist: farmer & bramley [2000] famca 1615, (2000) flc 93-060 at [68]–[69], contributions are to be assessed in a holistic manner across the course of the relationship and during the post-separation period to the point of assessment: horrigan & horrigan [2020] famcafc 25 at [35].

repayment of shortfall on h property apartment
o street
sale of h property apartment in 2017
way down to $500 the rent in brisbane. i was struggling to pay the mortgage on it, yes, and i was struggling to pay the body corporates. it was sold in 2016. he said by that stage he had accumulated $40,000 in body corporate fees and [k pty ltd] was sent a legal letter from [bh lawyers] in 2017 saying $43,000 was owed.
counsel suggested that he intentionally sold the h property apartment at a loss for tax purposes. he disagreed. he agreed however that he had already received a considerable sum of money from the sale of g pty ltd. he said that was in 2017 then changed his evidence and said he received those funds in 2013.
the original mortgage for the purchase of the [h property] apartment was obtained by [k pty ltd] as trustee for the [daultrey property unit trust]. it is my expectation that the nab [#...99] loan was also in the name of the [daultrey property unit trust] however i am not able to confirm the balance of the loan that was paid out on settlement.[40]
mr y observed he had not been able to locate the $25,000 deposit in the bank statements made available to him. nor have statements for the account nab #...99 been produced purportedly where $442,527.66 was paid into. the husband’s evidence was that he had obtained a loan from anz but no bank statement had ever been produced. the sum of $48,656.76 was paid with respect to outstanding body corporate levies for the h property apartment. the evidence regarding this transaction remains completely unsatisfactory save that i accept the h property apartment sold. i am not satisfied that any of the net proceeds of sale from the h property apartment were contributed by the husband to the parties’ properties.

additional matters
post separation 2014
the loan owing by [ms tavener] to [k pty ltd] was not on the balance sheet ‑ ‑ ‑‑ ‑ ‑ as at 30 june 2013. accordingly, it would appear to be a loan that has been created during the year ended 30 june 2014. accordingly, i am not able to conclude as to whether the loan owing by [ms tavener] to [k pty ltd] is genuine.
the settlement sheet shows a blank space and $450,000. it doesn’t say where the $450,000 went and we’ve never had disclosed the accounts of that loan, so we don’t know what the loan amount was, considering it was, you know, over $150,000 in income. she said he has not accounted for the sale proceeds.”   k pty ltd loan of $300,000 with a balance of ($105,729) (b) k pty ltd nab account ($10,998) (c) nab personal loan ($162,743) (d) nab cheque account ($47,465)   k pty ltd nab account ($10,998) (c) nab personal loan ($162,743) (d) nab cheque account ($47,465)   nab personal loan ($162,743) (d) nab cheque account ($47,465)   nab cheque account ($47,465)
section 90sf (3) factors
section 90sf (3) (o) ] it is obviously desirable as a general principle that the court should first of all identify the pool of assets available and evaluate it. if each party complies with his or her obligation to make a full and substantive disclosure of their financial affairs[44] there is no problem although there may be disputes as to valuation. however if, as here, one party fails to fulfil that obligation, is it open to that party then to rely on the absence of satisfactory evidence to prevent the making of an order against him or her which otherwise justice and equity would require? it would be simple, if that were the case, to evade the jurisdiction of this court, not by outright refusal which would attract sanctions but by obfuscation and evasion.  ] ...in order to be considered under s 79(4) (a) or (b) of the act, the defective disclosure must relate to a direct or indirect, financial or non-financial, contribution “to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them” (emphasis added). whilst we do not say that could never be the case, (for example, if the non- disclosure related to financial contributions to property) here where the pool was agreed, we cannot see it, and as the primary judge did not explain how the defective disclosure related to contributions, we cannot ascertain the reasoning upon which the decision is based (bennett and bennett [1990] famca 148, (1991) flc 92-191 at 78,266). [14] the usual way in which defective disclosure is taken into account is either by adding a sum to the pool, reflective of an estimate of the value of undisclosed property (as the primary judge seemingly acknowledged at [66]), or under s 75(2)(o) of the act. either of those is how any defective disclosure might properly have been accommodated here, although that said, the deficiency in question appears more about the timeliness, rather than the comprehensiveness, of the husband’s disclosure , and hence what weight it deserves is a live issue. however, we are satisfied that by factoring it in to the analysis of contributions, the primary judge erred, and further, his reasons in that respect are inadequate.”
assessment ] the primacy of s 20 of the act in identifying the proper approach to applications made under it is undoubtedly correct. to the extent that kardos purported to state principles which are not consistent with or fetter the broad discretion conferred by that section, it should not be followed. however, a number of recent cases have tended to talk in terms of assets owned by one party before the relationship began as “initial contributions” or as contributions “to the relationship”. the inference is that assets owned by the parties to a domestic relationship are in someway pooled even though they are not jointly owned. this approach is not reflected in the language of s 20. rather, s 20 assumes that the parties have “interests with respect to” property, a concept which will include both individual and jointly held property. it is those interests, as at the date of the application, which are sought to be “adjusted”. the use of the term “contributions” in this context is inapt because it reflects the language of paragraphs (a) and (b), defining the “contributions” to which the court must have reference in considering an appropriate adjustment.”
