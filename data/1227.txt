legal principles  the court may grant the party leave to apply after the end of the standard application period if the court is satisfied that: (a) hardship would be caused to the party or a child if leave were not granted, or (b) in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party--the party's circumstances were, at the end of the standard application period, such that he or she would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.   hardship would be caused to the party or a child if leave were not granted, or (b) in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party--the party's circumstances were, at the end of the standard application period, such that he or she would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.   in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party--the party's circumstances were, at the end of the standard application period, such that he or she would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.   first, would she suffer hardship if leave were not granted? if the answer to this question is answered in the negative, then that is the end of the matter. (2) if hardship is established, then the court must next consider whether to exercise its discretion to grant or to refuse leave to commence the proceedings.   if hardship is established, then the court must next consider whether to exercise its discretion to grant or to refuse leave to commence the proceedings.
the hardship referred to in sec. 44(4) is the hardship which would be caused to the applicant or a child of the marriage if leave were not granted. ... the requirement, that the court must be satisfied that hardship would be caused if leave were not granted, implies that it must be made to appear to the court that the applicant would probably succeed, if the substantive application were heard on the merits. if there is no real probability of success, then the court cannot be satisfied that hardship would be caused if leave were not granted. further, the matter with which the court is concerned is not whether the applicant or a child is suffering hardship, but the question is whether the applicant or a child would suffer hardship if leave were not granted. if the probable result of the hearing on the merits is that the hardship is not likely to be alleviated, then the court cannot be satisfied that the applicant or a child would suffer hardship if leave were not granted.
in our view the meaning of ‘hardship’ in subsec. 44(4) is akin to such concepts as hardness, severity, privation, that which is hard to bear or a substantial detriment. cf. the meanings assigned to ‘hardship’ in the shorter oxford dictionary and in webster’s new international dictionary ... ... in ordinary parlance, hardship means something more burdensome than “any appreciable detriment”. we consider that in subsec. 44(4) the word should have its usual, though not necessarily its most stringent, connotations. it is impossible to lay down in advance what particular facts may or may not amount to hardship in the relevant sense. as a general proposition it might be said that, the inability of an applicant to pursue a claim which in the circumstances of the applicant or a child of the marriage is trifling, generally will not cause hardship. similarly, where the costs which the applicant will have to bear himself or herself are about as much or more than what the applicant is likely to be awarded on a property claim, ordinarily hardship would not result if leave to institute proceedings were not granted. but otherwise we find no warrant in either subsec. 44(3) or 44(4) for saying that the right or entitlement lose must be a substantial one.[7] (emphasis in original)
... a consideration, but not a final determination, of the nature of the applicant’s claim. in doing so, the court must weigh the applicant’s case against that of the respondent’s and form a view as to whether there is in fact a prima facie case, or a real probability of success, that would, if leave were granted, alleviate hardship.[14]
... represents the legislature’s judgment that the welfare of society is best served by causes of action being litigated within the limitation period, notwithstanding that the enactment of that period may often result in a good cause of action being defeated. ... a limitation provision is the general rule, an extension provision is the exception to it. the extension provision is a legislative recognition that general conceptions of what justice requires in particular categories of cases may sometimes be overridden by the facts of an individual case.[17]   the length of the delay, (2) the reasons for the delay, (3) any prejudice occasioned to the respondent by reason of the delay, (4) the strengths, on the merits, of the applicant’s case, and (5) the degree of the hardship, which would be suffered unless leave was granted.   the reasons for the delay, (3) any prejudice occasioned to the respondent by reason of the delay, (4) the strengths, on the merits, of the applicant’s case, and (5) the degree of the hardship, which would be suffered unless leave was granted.   any prejudice occasioned to the respondent by reason of the delay, (4) the strengths, on the merits, of the applicant’s case, and (5) the degree of the hardship, which would be suffered unless leave was granted.   the strengths, on the merits, of the applicant’s case, and (5) the degree of the hardship, which would be suffered unless leave was granted.   the degree of the hardship, which would be suffered unless leave was granted.
these varying phrases may tend to suggest different shades of meaning whereas in reality they are directed to the same fundamental enquiry which basically is in the context whether on the applicant’s material he or she has a reasonable claim to be heard by the court.
prima facie claim  bona fide domestic relationship including joint bank account, sharing of expenses and a sexual relationship, (2) length of the relationship from 2011 to 2018, (3) the asset pool. specifically, the suburb c home (registered in the sole name of mr calloway) and placed on the market for sale by him in in mid-2023 and with the sales agency agreement dated mid-2023 listing a sale price of $900,000. the parties acknowledge, however, that the ultimate sale price will be determined by the market. ms kerry estimates an equity in the former home of between an estimated $350,000 to $400,000, (4) contributions by her in terms of section 90sm(4)(a) and (b) of the act, (5) contributions by her in terms of section 90sf(3) of the act including contributions towards the deposit for the purchase of the parties former home and payment of salary into an account from which the mortgage was paid, and (6) the use and enjoyment of the parties’ former home by mr calloway in the period post‑separation.   length of the relationship from 2011 to 2018, (3) the asset pool. specifically, the suburb c home (registered in the sole name of mr calloway) and placed on the market for sale by him in in mid-2023 and with the sales agency agreement dated mid-2023 listing a sale price of $900,000. the parties acknowledge, however, that the ultimate sale price will be determined by the market. ms kerry estimates an equity in the former home of between an estimated $350,000 to $400,000, (4) contributions by her in terms of section 90sm(4)(a) and (b) of the act, (5) contributions by her in terms of section 90sf(3) of the act including contributions towards the deposit for the purchase of the parties former home and payment of salary into an account from which the mortgage was paid, and (6) the use and enjoyment of the parties’ former home by mr calloway in the period post‑separation.   the asset pool. specifically, the suburb c home (registered in the sole name of mr calloway) and placed on the market for sale by him in in mid-2023 and with the sales agency agreement dated mid-2023 listing a sale price of $900,000. the parties acknowledge, however, that the ultimate sale price will be determined by the market. ms kerry estimates an equity in the former home of between an estimated $350,000 to $400,000, (4) contributions by her in terms of section 90sm(4)(a) and (b) of the act, (5) contributions by her in terms of section 90sf(3) of the act including contributions towards the deposit for the purchase of the parties former home and payment of salary into an account from which the mortgage was paid, and (6) the use and enjoyment of the parties’ former home by mr calloway in the period post‑separation.   contributions by her in terms of section 90sm(4)(a) and (b) of the act, (5) contributions by her in terms of section 90sf(3) of the act including contributions towards the deposit for the purchase of the parties former home and payment of salary into an account from which the mortgage was paid, and (6) the use and enjoyment of the parties’ former home by mr calloway in the period post‑separation.   contributions by her in terms of section 90sf(3) of the act including contributions towards the deposit for the purchase of the parties former home and payment of salary into an account from which the mortgage was paid, and (6) the use and enjoyment of the parties’ former home by mr calloway in the period post‑separation.   the use and enjoyment of the parties’ former home by mr calloway in the period post‑separation.
