5.1 attachment [y] and [x] have a natural and secure attachment to [the father]. there is a loving connection between [the father] and each of the boys, without any apparent strain and the supervised contact sessions flowed easily. the children are always excited to see [the father], and he reciprocates with the same level of enthusiasm. [x] and [y] willingly engage in affection. there are hugs at the commencement of the session and "love you" from both boys, reciprocated by [the father] at the completion of each session. when cancellations have been made [the father] has accepted these however has verbalised his disappointment, when offered a makeup session he always communicates, "i will make it work", in relation to re-organizing his work schedule. [the mother] presents as loving and protective of the children. she has expressed ongoing concerns about [y] and [x]’s behaviour before and after contact visits, referring to the behaviour as meltdowns. the reported behaviours include, poo smearing, stimming (chewing clothes, tapping) due to anxiety, wetting pants, snappiness. at the first supervised session [the mother] informed the writer that the time of the session needed to be reduced to 1 hour instead of 1 hour 45 minutes, as she wanted to assess "what the fall out for the boys would be" from the session. she elaborated that the boys saw [the father] for his birthday and both [y] and [x] had a meltdown after that visit. [the mother] reported the behaviours included, chewing clothes, and head banging, with both boys requiring containment in a small space to manage their individual emotional overwhelm. [the father] believes that the boys' behaviour can be related in part to their autism diagnosis but, also can be attributed to a range of changes they have experienced in a short space of time. [the father] doesn't believe the boys have had time to process and adjust to all the ongoing changes they have experienced over the course of the past couple of years. on a few occasions, [the mother] has bought [y] and [x] to the service early to lessen their anxiety and has asked the writer to remind them that they can leave at any stage during the sessions. the signal to use is to tap on the writer's hand to let her know they want to leave, and the writer will end the visit. the writer has consistently asked them if they felt comfortable to use the signal if they needed to. [y] and [x] gave the writer eye contact and said "yes". neither child has [sought] the writers support to leave a contact session or verbally expressed a desire to want to leave. ... [the mother’s] concerns for [y] and [x]’s wellbeing after the reported meltdowns, are very real for her and therefore should not be minimized. she has provided professional supports to encourage the best possible outcomes for [x] and [y]’s mental health and overall quality of life. 5.3 parenting style observations of [the father’s] parenting style is caring, calm and engaging with both boys. he remains engaged with [y] and [x] throughout the sessions, always demonstrating his interest in what they are doing and saying. ... [the father] has been seen to be calm, always fair but firm in setting boundaries and saying no. an example of this is when they were all playing [sports] and [x] and [y] began to argue over the rules of the game. in a calm but firm voice, [the father] told them, "don't yell, let's have a conversation, it's just a game, settle down". after listening to each boys' concerns, he told them, "one rule for everyone around throwing [a ball]". the boys listened to him, took instruction and the game progressed smoothly. he has been observed to embrace teaching opportunities, whether that be how to stand when playing [sports] or reading the rules of a game. ... 7. recommendations based on observations and interactions with all parties it would be strongly advocated for a progressed increase in time spent unsupervised between [the father], [y] and [x]. there is nothing to indicate that unsupervised contact would be premature or a concern. it would be suggested that initially a four (4) hour weekly unsupervised changeover occur, ideally on a saturday or sunday for two (2) months. this to be increased to a full day after this period for a further 2 months. at the end of this period, and all going well, a move to overnight would be supported once a fortnight or as determined by the family. the children's contact service can provide a changeover service if the parents wish to utilise this whilst they settle into a new routine.
... in terms of adult issues it appears that there has been a significant imbalance of power and allegations of significant abuse. [ms kimball] has raised issues of significant abuse which [mr ormond] has denied or limited. this may have to be tested. as it is, it is clear that this history or journey whatever form it took will prevent the parents from being able to have an effective co-parenting relationship into the future and the writer urges that any arrangements made will require that the parents maintain a distance from each other at all times. any communication between them will need to be limited and they may benefit from a parenting app such as app close to impart child related information. it is also recommended that it would be of significant assistance for any arrangements for time spent to be very clearly articulated with failing agreement clauses as required. in all, it appears that this family has been in crisis for some time. this has seemingly impacted the boys and their older sisters. ... specifically, the court has requested that the writer deal with the following matters: any views expressed by the children and any matters (such as the children's maturity or level of understanding) that would affect the weight that the court should take place on those views - the writer considers that the boys have been clear in their views that any time with their father needs to be carefully managed and supported by an independent third party for some time. the writer considers that they have been clear in suggesting that they would not manage overnight time at this stage. they presented as mature and clear in their discussions, particularly [x] who presented as more mature than [y]. it is clear that [x] will require someone who he considers will listen to him and believe him. the writer has no issue with extended family undertaking this role as long as they are able to listen to the boys and meet their needs. it is expected that ndis is unlikely to provide the supports required. f) recovery and rehabilitation of the father with respect to drug and alcohol use - [the father] has indicated that this is now under control. he has clearly indicated that, at times, it was not in control. the boys have spoken about their father drinking to excess and there being broken bottles in the back yard. the court may need to gather further evidence to support the claim of sobriety as made by [the father]. what is clear to the writer is that the boys anxiety would increase significantly if they were present with [the father] and he began drinking. this is likely to be a trigger for them and is likely to put them on edge, waiting for associated behaviour such as yelling and other abuse. it is respectfully suggested that should [the father] drink alcohol when with the boys or either of them they would be likely to refuse to return to his care again. as such, it appears that [the father] has a choice to make, no alcohol and begin a reunification process with the boys or risk permanent refusal, g) any risk the father poses to the children - through the eyes of the boys, [the father’s] past behaviour has been poor and has clearly put them at risk. [the mother] has identified that she has been at risk. if the court is satisfied that [the father] has sufficiently addressed alcohol misuse then it is expected that the level of risk to the boys will have significantly reduced. the writer gained the view that [the father] has done so and is now aware that his drinking in the past has caused damage. [the mother] has raised other concerns about [the father] around coercive controlling behaviour and the writer considers that this was seemingly primarily in relation to his relationship with her. the writer considers that the boys are getting older and as such their awareness of any risk for themselves will fine tune. they appeared to be aware of risk and [x] in particular was clear that he was able to call it out. it is considered that [the father] is at risk of not having a relationship with the boys should his behaviour deteriorate whilst he is with them or if his behaviour become abusive of them or of their mother in front of them. as such it is again expected that the boys would withdraw from arrangements and the writer respectfully suggests that it is [the father] who is on notice that any risk factors he may introduce, be it aggression, alcohol fuelled behaviour or such other issue will see a complete withdrawal of willingness to engage in any time with him, ... recommendations on the information gathered it is respectfully recommended that the following be considered: consideration be given to an order providing sole parental responsibility to [the mother] with an obligation to inform and seek the view of [the father] and to consider such view before making a decision. there should also be provision for [the father] to inform [the father] of any decision made once a decision is made. . the boys remain living with [the mother] the boys spend time with [the father] starting with supervised time with an agreed third party for daytime only with consideration given to time spent occurring, midweek for a matter of hours, on alternate saturday and sunday around sports and, for special occasion times such as, christmas, birthdays, father's day, time during the day for school holidays with specific dates provided or a reliable regime outlined where possible. it is recommended that the time spent arrangement start slowly and increase incrementally. this should be done over a two month period as the immediate commencement of midweek and weekend time may be overwhelming for the boys and [x] in particular and see refusal occur. it is recommended that exchange should occur at school or at ... mcdonalds with [the mother] not getting out of her vehicle. failing this exchange process being successful, the parents use [gg contact service] for exchange if/where available. there be a suspension of time for, the boys birthdays, [the mother’s] birthday, mother's day and time at christmas in the event that the boys are ordinarily in [the father’s] care, and, there be correspondence regarding the boys wellbeing and an authority to share medical and educational information so [the father] can remain informed.
f) recovery and rehabilitation of the father with respect to drug and alcohol use - [the father] has indicated that this is now under control. he has clearly indicated that, at times, it was not in control. the boys have spoken about their father drinking to excess and there being broken bottles in the back yard. the court may need to gather further evidence to support the claim of sobriety as made by [the father]. what is clear to the writer is that the boys anxiety would increase significantly if they were present with [the father] and he began drinking. this is likely to be a trigger for them and is likely to put them on edge, waiting for associated behaviour such as yelling and other abuse. it is respectfully suggested that should [the father] drink alcohol when with the boys or either of them they would be likely to refuse to return to his care again. as such, it appears that [the father] has a choice to make, no alcohol and begin a reunification process with the boys or risk permanent refusal, g) any risk the father poses to the children - through the eyes of the boys, [the father’s] past behaviour has been poor and has clearly put them at risk.
