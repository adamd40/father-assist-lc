the report of ms hh
... [mr abberley] believes that, in order for [x] to have a relationship with him, it is important for [ms clement] to relocate to [city kk] or [town s] with [x]. he said that the current distances between the homes would make it impossible for [x] to visit for weekends, or to have regular supervised visits. he suggested that it would be a good time for [ms clement] to relocate, as [x] has not yet begun school. he stated that it would be difficult for him to relocate from [town s], as he has established work, friendships, and owns a home in the area. [mr abberley] displayed an openness to a variety of options for supervised visits with [x], and believes these should occur as a matter of urgency. he added that further delays to visits, due to supervision centre waiting times, is not in [x]’s interest. he stated that his family members could assist, that he would be willing to meet [x] in a public place, and would be willing to have visits supervised by a member of [ms clement]’s family. [mr abberley] stated that his wish is “to be there for [x]”, and that he wants the responsibilities of being a father. he said that this included “having a say” in schooling and medical decisions. he added that the does not wish to take [x] away from his mother, and that he wants “what is best” for [x]. ... [ms clement] reported that she was “quite surprised and offended” by [mr m]’s family report, and said that she feels he misinterpreted some of her comments. she said that many of the report’s conclusions appeared to be accurate, but that the recommendations did not appear aligned with the conclusions. she stated that the report identified that [mr abberley] has an “undiagnosed personality disorder”, and was found to be “lying on the psychometric testing”. she added that she was confused by the recommendations, as the report stated that [x]’s relationship with [mr abberley] would “only work” if she supported the relationship, but also stated that she has a genuine fear of [mr abberley]. she stated that she has spoken with two psychologists, who have both said the family report recommendations did not make sense. she added that the judge had been “unimpressed”, at [mr m]’s suggestion that supervised visits could commence, while [mr abberley] continued to use alcohol and drugs. she said that the judge had stated a belief that [x] should not spend any time with a parent who used any alcohol or illicit drugs. [ms clement] described a settled family lifestyle with her partner, [mr gg], their child, [ff], [an infant], and [x]. she reported that she and [mr gg] began their relationship at the beginning on 2021, but that they have known one another since they were adolescents. she reported that [mr gg] has just begun fulltime work as a [tradesperson], and that she works from home as an [administration officer]. [ms clement] stated that [ff] will commence childcare in [early] 2023, and she plans to increase her work hours. she reported that she is not able to work in [city kk] [in her current role], which was one reason for relocating to her current area. [ms clement] described [x] as “smart and happy”, and reported that he has been excelling since they relocated. she said that [x] enjoys his childcare program, and also attends [sports lessons]. she reported that her biological parents and siblings live in the sydney area, and that [x] regularly spends time with his cousins and other family members. [ms clement] stated that her partner’s parents live in [city kk], but visit them regularly. ... [ms clement] raised concerns about [mr abberley]’s ongoing drug use, alleging that he has only completed one hair follicle test, which was positive for [illicit substances]. she said that the icl has requested 7-8 urinalysis tests, but that he has only completed one test. she said that [mr abberley] has stated that he cannot afford to attend further testing, but she does not think this is the case. she added that the icl offered to have a hair follicle test funded through legal aid, but that [mr abberley] refused. [ms clement] alleged that [mr abberley] regularly used [illicit substances], not routinely tested for in the standard drug tests requested. she said that she does not think that parents should use any drugs or alcohol, as this will negatively affect their parenting capacity. ... [ms clement] reported that she experiences “situational anxiety” in relation to [mr abberley] and the court process, but does not experience anxiety in her daily life. she stated that she is prescribed [medication] to assist with her anxiety. she said that, prior to her relationship with [mr abberley], she experienced a period of depression, as she had a falling out with some friends, and her mother was very unwell. she said that, despite her low mood, she was able to continue working long hours. ... [ms clement] stated that there is no point in beginning supervised visits for [x] and [mr abberley], if they are not going to progress to unsupervised visits. she said that it would “disrupt [x’s] whole world” without any benefit to [x]. she stated that, even if she were not directly involved in taking [x] to visits, she does not think she could manage the emotional impact of [x] talking about visits or asking questions about [mr abberley]. she said that, regardless of what orders are made, she is certain that it is not in x’s interests to have a relationship with [x], and so she will not support it. she said that, if the court wishes for [x] to have a relationship with [mr abberley], the court will need to “work out the logistics”, because she and her partner will not provide any assistance to facilitate the arrangements. [ms clement] reported that she was adopted at birth, and was told about the adoption when she was four or five years old. she said that, because of this information, she did not feel bonded to her adoptive parents. she said that, when she met her biological family as an adult, she felt an immediate bond with them. she believes that, for [x], it would be best if he did not know anything about his father. [ms clement] said that [x] has assumed that her current partner is his father, and that they have a close bond. she said that she does not want to disrupt their relationship by telling [x] that [mr gg] is not his biological father. she said that, if [mr abberley] is not involved in [x]’s life, then she may tell [x] when he is older, but said that she wants to wait until [x] is old enough to understand. she added that, if she does tell [x] about [mr abberley], she thinks she would need to tell [x] that [mr abberley] is “an unsafe person and we had to move to get away”. she does not believe that it would benefit [x] to have any contact with his extended paternal family. she said that [mr abberley’s] sister has said “nasty things” to her, and she does not trust any of his family to protect [x] from [mr abberley]. ... neither parent was able to identify any possible parenting strengths in the other parent, and seemed to hold a fixed, negative perception of the other parent. after some thought, [mr abberley] identified that [x] appears healthy and well-dressed in the photos he receives, so it seems that [ms clement] is meeting [x]’s physical needs. [ms clement] stated that [mr abberley] may be “lovely, charming and helpful” towards [x] when in public, but she believes that this would be an “act”, and that he would be “different behind closed doors”. ... evaluation this matter focuses on three-year-old [x], and whether he should have a relationship with his biological father. based on [x]’s stage of development, the priorities for him are to have a safe and stable home environment, warm, emotionally sensitive relationships with his caregivers, opportunities to have meaningful relationships with his parents and understanding his place in his family, and a child-focused routine with opportunities for early learning and play. [x] has been described as a bright, happy, healthy child, who is thriving developmentally. no concerns have been raised about his health or the care he currently receives. [ms clement] described an age-appropriate routine, including positive parenting strategies, and a capacity to reflect on [x]’s experiences. [ms clement] has reported that she does not consume alcohol or other drugs, and has engaged in psychological interventions to address her mental health issues. it seems that [mr gg] has taken on the role of a psychological parent in [x]’s life, and [ms clement] and [mr gg] reported that [x] has a close and comfortable relationship with [mr gg]. the only concern raised by [mr abberley] about [ms clement], is her unwillingness to involve him in [x]’s life. [ms clement] has described a settled family lifestyle, with access to employment, stable accommodation, and family support. a period of stability for [x] and [ms clement] is likely to benefit [x], and it does not appear to be in his interests to relocate to [city kk] or [region g]. [x] has only met his father on one occasion, for a period of 15 minutes. while the contact report indicates that [x] was settled during the visit, [ms clement] was highly distressed. [mr abberley] believes it is important for [x] to have his father in his life. research indicates that most children benefit from a meaningful relationship with each of their biological parents, where this is safe. for [x], contact with his father will provide him with understanding about his place in his family, and assist the development of his self-identity. even if [x] does not spend time with his father, it is important that he understands his family history, and that he is given age-appropriate information about his biological father. [ms clement] expressed uncertainty about how to support [x]’s understanding, and she is likely to benefit from assistance from a psychologist to develop these strategies. [x] is likely to best integrate this information if he is provided with some knowledge about his biological father at a young age, and if then given opportunities to ask additional questions as he develops. there is a risk that, if not told about his biological father, [x] will later experience psychological distress and a sense of resentment or betrayal towards his immediate family members, and particularly [ms clement]. [ms clement] believes that the risk posed to her and [x]’s wellbeing outweighs the benefits of [x] having contact with [mr abberley]. she has alleged that [mr abberley] was emotionally abusive, and at times physically abusive, during their relationship, and that he stalked and harassed her following the separation. she has alleged that [mr abberley] has severe mental health issues, including a possible undiagnosed personality disorder, which she believes underpins his behaviour. [mr abberley] has reported that he has attempted to address his mental health issues and drug use through engaging in a rehabilitation program and engaging with psychologists. he indicated that he has reduced his drug use, though continues to use [illicit substances]. while these are positive steps, it does not appear that [mr abberley] has comprehensively addressed his mental health issues, through engaging regularly with a psychologist, who has access to information about the relationship history. [mr abberley] displayed limited insight into the impact of his behaviour on [ms clement]. he appeared to minimise his harassing and abusive messages and telephone calls following the separation, and did not accept that his attempts to find her could have been perceived as threatening. [mr abberley] may benefit from engaging in a men’s behaviour change program to develop his insight into the impact of his behaviour. [ms clement] has a high level of anxiety about the possibility of contact with [mr abberley], and believes that her mental health would deteriorate dramatically if she was required to communicate with [mr abberley] or allow [x] to have contact with him. [ms clement]’s level of fear appears based on her perception of ongoing harassment, rather than due to a high level of risk to [ms clement]’s or [x]’s physical safety. there are minimal indications that [mr abberley] would attempt to physical harm or kidnap [x]. [ms clement] may benefit from ongoing psychological intervention to assist her to develop a realistic model of the risks posed by [mr abberley], and ensure that her anxiety does not negatively affect her parenting. there appears to be a high likelihood that, if [ms clement] were ordered to facilitate time between [x] and [mr abberley], she would not adhere to orders. this has the potential to create ongoing proceedings. there is a reasonable concern that, if the court requires [x] to spend time with [mr abberley], this may negatively affect [ms clement]’s mental health and her parenting of [x]. due to [ms clement]’s inability to facilitate the relationship between [x] and [mr abberley], through regular time spending, it seems the only option is for [x] is to spend “recognition time” with [mr abberley]. [ms clement] was unwilling to discuss options for making [x]’s visits with [mr abberley] less stressful, but the following options may reduce her level of distress. if the court decides that [x] should spend recognition time with [mr abberley], it may be beneficial to delay the beginning of visits for a period of six months, so that [ms clement] has time to work with her psychologist on strategies for managing her distress and improve her capacity to communicate reliably with [x] about his parentage. [x] would also be older and may cope better with the knowledge and experience of his father. it appears that these visits would need to occur in a professionally supervised setting, and it would be best if another person transported [x] to and from visits, so that [ms clement] is not present. based on the distances between the parents’ homes, and [ms clement]’s wish that visits do not take place near to her home, this would require travel by [mr abberley] and [x], to a neutral third place. it would therefore be important that the frequency of visits was not disruptive for [x]’s lifestyle. it appears unlikely that the parents could communicate with one another to make decisions about [x]. [ms clement] is adamant that she will not communicate with [mr abberley], and [mr abberley] appears to lack insight into [ms clement]’s level of fear. it also appears that [ms clement]’s capacity to focus on [x]’s needs would be hindered if she was required to communicate and negotiate with [mr abberley]. it therefore seems that an arrangement in which [ms clement] holds sole parental responsibility for [x] would be preferable. recommendations in light of the above discussion, and unless evidentiary material should indicate otherwise, it is respectfully recommended that: [ms clement] hold sole parental responsibility for [x]. [x] live with his mother. [ms clement] engage with a psychologist to develop strategies for managing her anxiety about [mr abberley], and to develop strategies for speaking with [x] about his biological father in an age-appropriate manner. if the court finds that it is in [x]’s interests to spend recognition time with [mr abberley]: [x] spend time with [mr abberley] at a supervised contact centre in sydney once every six months, with [mr gg] or another family member transporting [x] to and from visits.
oral evidence of ms hh
respondent mother’s oral evidence
written submissions on behalf of the applicant father
introduction the mother is running a no-contact case on the basis that there’s no actual or potential benefit in introducing [x] to his father. yet when the mother senses that the tide is turning at the eleventh hour, she purports to alter her view, conditional upon non-contact, even after all indications are the court ordered first visit went well. the mother has a history of not complying with orders if it does not suit her and all indications are that she will continue to do so. there is no evidence that the father is a risk to [x] yet the irrational assertions by the mother, supported by nothing more than catchphrases of concern, is designed to interfere with [x] forming any type of relationship with his father. at best her case is one of form not substance. her plan is for her partner [mr gg] is to be identified by [x] as his father and to do this [x] is not to know the existence of his biological father. the court has the benefit of an expert report which makes it clear that it is in the best interests of [x] to have contact with his father. there is no need for any further expert evidence on that front. the court should not allow itself to be distracted by ordering recognition to simply placate the mother. whilst the mother has mental health issues they are unreasonably interfering with the father/son relationship because the mother is being allowed to set the narrative and even control what orders are to be complied with. the mother has longstanding mental health issues that predated her relationship with the father. both her and her partner have a history of drug and alcohol abuse that have not been explored. in contrast, the father’s drug abuse is now confined to the use of [illicit substances] which whilst illegal does not necessarily impact on his ability to be a proper parent. there is ample expert evidence supporting that [x] and his father should have contact. there is no evidence that says that such contact would be detrimental. the mother is doing everything within her ability to interfere with any suggestion for contact. for example, as discussed below, she says that contact should be delayed and then relies on delay to undermine the success of the first contact meeting. the mother has been able to control the narrative to the extent that the proceedings have advanced on the basis that even though the father is not a risk: a) he is not entitled to know where his son lives, b) is not entitled to information about his child’s schooling, c) not entitled to medical information, and d) any attempt to find information that any parent would otherwise be entitled to know is to be construed as his being unreasonable and passively aggressive: including when he seeks relief from this court. for some reason, it has become a “given” that the father is not entitled to know where his son is living and receiving his care and education. keeping child from father and real motivation the mother has gone to great lengths to exclude the father from the life of their child [x]. she has relocated and, whether or not this was a motivation to get away from the father, it is clear that she has decided that she wants to keep her address secret for no justifiable reason. she has created a narrative that, by the father wanting to know where his child resides, he is some kind of stalker and it is concerning that this unilateral decision is receiving unquestioned support. simply put, there is no reason that the father should not know the address of where his child is living. how does his not knowing support the interests of the child? the mother acknowledges that the father requested to know [x]’s address and those who may be living there. this is a standard and reasonable request however the mother sees it as not giving her space. it is all about her. the mother has created a scenario regarding risk that simply does not exist. she uses emotive altruistic catchphrases that are not supported by specific evidence. she has attempted in the past to make allegations to police which were not supported by any evidence. luckily, in one instance the father had an alibi. the father has no criminal record let alone allegations of violence. it is the mother’s desire to have a life where the son and father has no relationship and the child is led to believe that her current partner is his father. having the biological father in the picture seems to ruin her idea of family. even if one were to accept the alleged risk, it is clear that the mother not only would refuse to accommodate contact but also does not want x to know who is his biological father which is not a safety issue. the eleventh-hour suggestion of introducing a child psychologist is a distraction: it simply serves to delay what should be the inevitable. the court has all the expert evidence it needs. there is nothing unusually complicated with these facts beyond catering to the mother’s unsubstantiated demands. the mother’s concerns are more a reflection of her own issues. that is, it is in the backdrop of her not being able to establish a meaningful relationship with her natural parents whilst growing up and having a most troubled relationship with her adoptive parents. history of violence the mother seems to base her case of fear on the period between when she announced to the father that she was pregnant and the time up to her giving birth to [x]. the evidence reveals that when the father first heard that the mother was pregnant that he sent most inappropriate messages which he now regrets. this was over 4 years ago (2019) and is not a reason per se for denying time between [x] and his father. furthermore, the father had the sense to get professional help and has positively reflected on his attitude. it is unsurprising that once a child is born dynamics and attitudes change. the court would have no difficulty in finding that the father genuinely wants to have a meaningful relationship with [x]. there is no current threat from [x] knowing who his father is unless, as mother has threatened to do, she chooses to paint him in a bad light. this surely cannot be in the best interests of [x] but this does not seem to be a concern of the mother. it is a warning to the court however that others need to forge the relationship between father and son to minimize the effect of the mother’s negativism. the parents are no longer in a relationship and there is no need or risk of further messages in that vein being sent. if the court was somehow still concerned about it, it is easily remedied by order. at the end of the day, whilst it provides relevant history, it is not a major concern that the court would have moving forward. there have never been any police charges or family violence orders against the father. the father’s attempts to find his son’s address is no indication of violence, furthermore he also quite properly needed to know an address for service. history of drug abuse both parents and [mr gg] have abused drugs. father continues to use [illicit substances] to assist with treatment of [a medical condition]. whilst it is most unfortunate that the father did not take full advantage of the returning negative samples in drug testing, the icl made it clear through questioning that a clean outcome would have resulted in supervised time. failure to provide a clear test should not disqualify [x] from having time with his father. furthermore, what is more important is that when there was time at [l families], it was successful. before one can be too judgmental of the father, the court will recall that both the mother and the new partner have a history of drug abuse and there is no ongoing requirement for them to be tested. in the case of [mr gg], there has never been a test. [ms hh] opines, even if the father continues to use [illicit substances], that there is a low risk to [x], especially if time occurs in a professionally supervised environment. mother’s needs are superior to the needs of the child the mother is not child focussed when it comes to the need for the father and [x] to have a meaningful relationship. whether it is true or not, her motivation for keeping [x] away from his father seems to be so that she can run her new family in a way that she prefers and that is by not only keeping [x] away from his father but also making sure that he doesn’t know about the existence of his father. distractions there is no reason for the mother to keep her address secret from the father. it never has been established why the mother should be keeping [x]’s address from the father. even if necessary, there are many options to control the father’s conduct without denying the child contact with his father but nothing has warranted such court intervention. the matter has progressed on nothing more than the mother’s unsubstantiated position. the mother has been able to control the narrative to such an extent that it seems to be “a given” that the father should not know, among other things, where his child is living and which daycare he attends. even in hearing there were concerns raised about the location where the sister of the father parked. even though there are no orders, it was almost simply accepted that the mother’s demands should be met. it is the potential unquestioning of the mother’s decision that probably contributes to her belief that she makes all the calls and if not addressed will continue to be an impediment to creating a meaningful relationship between father and son. the father did not try to keep the attendance of the sister a secret. the father made full disclosure: he then is criticised for it. the mother is constantly lying in wait to find something to criticise. in fact, if it were discovered without disclosure, the father would have undoubtedly been criticised for trying to hide it. the court may well reach the conclusion that this is evidence about the mother being self-focussed instead of child focussed and support a position that her role in contact should be minimised. even if somehow a problem, this can be managed by orders: including orders that a person other than the mother deliver [x] for contact purposes. if [mr gg] were to deliver [x], no one would show any interest in the mother at all. mother cannot be relied upon to assist with creating a meaningful relationship between [x] and the father. the mother has made it clear that she has no interest in assisting with creating any father/son relationship. the mother cannot be trusted to comply with orders of the court. the mother was ordered to send the father photographs. she placed no value on the court’s orders and obvious views that it was in the best interests of [x] to recognise his biological father. it was too inconvenient for her, and she could not see the benefit to her. this shows that it is all about her and she resents that the father might get any joy in having photos of his child. it is most troubling that the court is being urged to change an otherwise appropriate order, simply because the mother refuses to comply. without inclination to enforce, the mother has absolutely no motivation to comply, especially if the court gives her the impression that compliance is discretionary. in contrast, the mother seems to have no difficulty with relying on court orders when she is arguing that the failure to comply with drug testing should deprive [x] from seeing his father. the mother chooses to send low quality photos and then criticised the father when he requests clearer photos. he explained that he would like to print some out obviously to display as parents do. the only avenue the father has to get the benefit of orders is to remind the mother that court is his only option. he should not be criticised for this otherwise, as the history has made clear, the mother will firstly ignore the spirit of the court order and then ultimately the court order itself: obviously in the belief that there will be no consequences. if she truly wanted to avoid litigation, this would be an easy step to follow. keeping address and schooling secret whilst acknowledging that she would always want to know where [x] was, the mother does not believe that the father should know. it is clear that the father would want to know this information and prima face is entitled to know where his child lives. the way of keeping this information from the father is for the mother to simply say that she does not want the father to know her address. the father has no interest in the mother’s personal life and there is nothing in the evidence that suggests otherwise. all indications, including the controlled visit indicate that contact has and will continue to be positive. xxm of father on behalf of the mother there was lengthy cross examination of the father on behalf of the mother but almost nothing about the father/child relationship: it was all about the mother. there was nothing negative about the actual contact meeting. it was about the sister being in the carpark. it was all about having to gain the mother’s trust and approval, and interpreting everything the father did in the most negative way. for example, the father makes honest disclosure which is interpreted as an effort to hassle the mother. the court would have no difficulty in finding that if there was anything directly negative about the father/son time, that the mother would have raised it. a) the cross-examination was not child focussed, and b) even if the historic relationship is of concern, orders can be made to alleviate those concerns. xxm of father by icl no major concerns raised about the quality of contact with [x]. it was more along the lines or whether his use of [illicit substances] and the mother’s unwillingness to cooperate should reduce his time to recognition or no time at all. when cross-examining about not undergoing testing, the icl was concerned about what effect it would have on the mother trust over issues regarding contact time. [dr q] [dr q] was retained by the mother for her own issues. she made selective disclosures about her past. some issues raised in cross examination were not known by the doctor. [dr q] provides evidence only in relation to the mother. she does not provide any insight or information about the impact of the mother’s views on [x] or his interests. the doctor did not conduct an independent assessment of the father and simply accepts the mother’s account. “i base my opinion on the narrative that she has told me”. [dr q] has not seen the report by [ms hh] and is unaware of what was recommended. the sessions with the mother were not focussed on [x], they focussed more on the mother’s alleged fears about [x] being around the father. the mother advised that she did not want [x] to have any contact with his father. the mother made it clear that she did not trust the court18 and said that she will not cooperate with court orders. this is a theme that the mother has maintained. the solution is not simply to accept that the mother will not comply and give her what she wants at the cost of depriving [x] of a relationship with his father. [dr q] has not seen [x]. [dr q] disclosed that she has simply reported what she was told by the mother during therapy session21 and that if she was not told everything by the mother, agreed that she could not provide an opinion on information she didn’t have. [dr q] reports that the mother is doing well: it would appear even with the backdrop of the ongoing litigation. she has made it clear that the mother’s anxiety is triggered at the thought of [x] having contact with his father. if [dr q’s] evidence is accepted no solution should involve the mother being relied upon to give effect to court orders. therefore, perhaps the approach has to be that contact commences forthwith with the assistance of [mr gg] and issues regarding the mother’s mental health should be separately managed. [dr q] reports that the mother remains triggered with anything to do with [mr abberley] which is not quite true as she takes a healthy interest in his capacity to pay child support. she also at the eleventh hour, to avoid [x] having contact with his father, suggests a regime that involves her contact with the father or at least photos and documents relating to him. the mother visited [dr q] because of the anxiety of the final hearing. it related to intrusive thoughts regarding her past relationship with the father. her anxiety is related to her experience with the father. this should not be forced upon [x] who will be able to form his own views from contact and not be as influenced about his mother’s feelings towards the father once that bond is established. [dr q] spoke about panic attacks relating to this hearing which seemed to be a first. there is no suggestion that when she had previously been the applicant for relocation that she suffered such anxiety or panic attacks. the objective evidence is more suggestive that it might not even be so much the father as opposed to the unfavourable outcome that she was contemplating about father/son contact. looking at [dr q’s] evidence in the most favourable light for the mother, the concerns were that [x] would not be safe. not unlike during the hearing, the mother could not actually identify how [x] would be unsafe but prefers to simply quote the safety concern catchphrase with no actual or objective evidence to support it. [dr q] reports that the mother’s “grave fears” were that the father would be under the influence of drugs and alcohol and had made no attempt to cease any of that use. use of [illicit substances] is illegal, there are many jurisdictions where it is not, in fact at any time the law could change in the [city kk]. for the purposes of risk, it is submitted that the risk should be assessed on the impact it has during contact and not simply legality. notwithstanding, contact, at least initially, will take place in a supervised environment which will not be allowed to go ahead if the father is under the influence of drugs and alcohol. there is no risk of physical and/or verbal abuse. [dr q] indicated that [ms clement] advised that she has grave fears for her son’s safety should [mr abberley] be provided with unsupervised access to her son. a) it is worthy of note the reference to “her” son and not “his” or even “their” son. b) the indication was that the concerns related to unsupervised access. from 2021 this changed to include supervised access. there is nothing the father has done since 2021 to justify increased risk. there is nothing to suggest that [x] would be unsafe if left alone with the father, let alone in a controlled environment. [dr q] reports that the mother claims that she does not trust anyone beside herself, her partner and day care staff to look after [x]. it is submitted that her limited trust is convenient and self-serving. it is clear that the trust does not extend to the courts and the professional agencies that potentially facilitate father/son contact yet it does extend to a day care facility that she undoubtedly needs to be able to work. the alleged lack of trust seems to align with whether it suits her needs. notwithstanding, this needs to be explored in the context of having the agency facilitate contact. one must not forget that the 15-minute visit was most successful and did not involve the three trusted persons and entity. it is axiomatic that the court and agencies such a [l families] offer safe environments for contact between parents and children. her trust of a day care centre must have started with first contact, the court should consider taking this lead and taking a similar approach for the purposes of contact. [dr q] made it clear in answer to his honour’s question that nothing would seem to alleviate her levels of anxiety. that being the case, it is submitted that contact, beyond mere recognition, should be commenced and once [x] knows who his biological father is and the mother sees that it is safe, there is no reason why any genuine concerns should not be overcome. it should be remembered that, except for the mother’s campaign to keep the father out of the life of [x], she seems to function very well. [dr q] opines that every time family court hearings or things come up, that re‑triggers her and she becomes extremely anxious and overwhelmed again. if the court were able to make orders that minimise the need to appear in future, it would appear that the anxiety would reduce. when the mother sees that there are no safety concerns, there should be no issue of a meaningful relationship being maintained between [x] and his father. therefore it is submitted that the court should order contact, initially supervised (even though there is no actual danger to [x]) and if that operates successfully the mother should, if genuine, encourage ongoing contact. if she does not, it might be the case that the motivation to keep father and son separated has nothing to do with safety issues and more with personal preference. the sessions with [dr q] have been going on for some years and it would seem has not progressed the issue of contact: it simply has delayed it. the doctor has opined that therapeutic intervention seems to be exhausted. the time to resolve issues by therapy alone has passed and perhaps it is time to introduce some changes and manage those. it is not suggested that therapy should not be continued if deemed to be useful, but any proposed therapy should not delay contact between [x] and his father: it should run parallel. furthermore, funding of ongoing treatment is becoming an issue, so other options through court orders need to be considered. the mother also had difficulties with other relationships including her adoptive father. it would seem that [dr q], having not been told, did not explore many of these issues and preferred to concentrate only on the mother’s account of her feelings about the father. [dr q] did not know that the mother and her current partner have a history of drug and alcohol abuse. [ms hh] (court child expert) [ms hh] supports contact as soon as possible: initially in a supervised environment. she was forced to consider the alternative of recognition time only because of the impact contact will have on the mother. it is clearly not her preferred option. recognition would only have a sense of [mr abberley] as a person not as a parent. at best one would hope that it would be sufficient for him to hold the father in his mind. such a risk is unnecessary and potentially introduces new problems. she opines that the younger [x] is when introduced to his father that it will make it easier for him if he has knowledge of who his biological father is earlier rather than having to revise his understanding later on. at the first contact meeting, [x] had no problem coping or separating from his mother to meet the father, it was the mother who had the difficulty separating. the court might find it beneficial to build on this positive start. it was suggested, as the court raised, that this could take place in a contact centre. in terms of meeting the father it would not be psychologically difficult to do so at this young age. what is likely to be difficult is the response of the adults around him. if they can support him through that and remain positive, then it would not likely be a psychologically damaging experience to meet his father. [ms hh] continued that in her view that, in the event that the mother and [x]’s stepfather were appropriately supportive and positive regarding the reintroduction of the time and the meeting of the father, it could be appropriate for [x] to commence supervised time with his father now. no matter how much showing photographs are perceived to be an option, it is inferior to actual contact. notwithstanding, the mother has shown that she cannot be relied upon to show photos or provide positive comments about the father because she does not see how it benefits her. this expert also noted that there was nothing that the father could do that would allay her anxieties in any way, regardless of his drug us, mental health or connection to supports. it is submitted that the time has come to parallel manage contact between [x] and his father and treating the mother’s irrational fears. the former should not be dependent upon the latter as all indications are that nothing will naturally change. [ms hh] confirmed that the mother believes that [x] should identify [mr gg] as dad and not [mr abberley]. notwithstanding that the mother may be anxious, it is in the best interests for [x] to know who his father is. the mother has fallen out with other friends and relatives in the past whilst she had extant mental health issues that were not explored. there could be utility in a more detailed assessment of the mother’s mental health instead of just working from the premise that only the father has relevant mental health issues. but for the mother’s resistance/mental health issues, it would seem that contact and time between the father and [x] would go well. there is no suggestion that the father would say anything negative about the mother. the mother advised that if she were to tell [x] about the father she would need to tell him that: “[mr abberley] is an unsafe person and we had to move to get away” which is not only untrue, but most damaging. [ms hh] was of the view that managing the mother’s mental health issues at the same time as moving forward with a positive relationship between the father and the son would be an ideal scenario. if not told about his biological father, [x] might experience psychological distress. this risk should be addressed when [x] is very young. it is also beneficial for [x] to know about his extended family which will not be progressed by the mother. even the mother accepts that a child focussed parent, in normal circumstances, would encourage regular time with another parent when it is safe. there is no doubt that there is no real risk to [x]’s safety. the mother when the mother senses that things may not be going her way, she is most able to adjust her position and at best does it begrudgingly. the mother says that she is still confused as to the benefit to [x] of knowing who his father is: which is a different issue to safety. this is significant because it accords with her intention to exclude his father from his life. the mother has absolutely ignored the expert advice of the need for [x] and his father to bond. it simply does not sit with her agenda, and she cannot be relied upon to advance it. the mother says: “probably the easiest way for me to be able to agree to get [x] the benefit that he may need from this without having to go through actual contact”. it’s all about avoiding contact and interfering the father/son bond. the mother has proven that she cannot be relied upon to comply with orders. the mother has made it clear that she does not intend to say anything positive about the father. she has made it clear in cross examination that her position has not changed. it is therefore not appropriate to have the mother assume any intermediary role. in fact she has recently made the decision that any contact involving her would need to involve a child psychologist. that is, the mother has created another barrier to delay contact and made it clear that she won’t be speaking to [x] about his father until she gets advice. simply put, the mother cannot be involved at this stage and the role should be assumed by experts from contact centres. the mother did not and does not want the biological father to be involved in any decisions about [x]. she decided not to allow him any input in naming [x] nor even to include him on the birth certificate. she originally agreed to mediation to discuss moving forward but unilaterally withdrew. the father was being most reasonable in the circumstances. she refused to engage because allegedly the father was intimidating her by trying to find where they were. the mother had been estranged from her biological parents by adoption and found it a positive experience to find them. the mere knowledge of their existence was not enough. it is worthy to note that the mother says that she felt a disconnect from the family that she was supposed to be in and connected to because of her parents horrible breakup, their hatred of each other and their lack of communication. her admitted confusion was “you don’t belong here and don’t know where you do belong”. this is exactly what [x] is facing by excluding him from contact with his father and having him believe untruths: namely that [mr abberley] does not exist and that [mr gg] is his father. the mother now has a most positive relationship with her biological parents, siblings and extended family. [x] loves spending time with the mother’s biological family. the mother was not prepared to admit that indications would be that [x] would have a similar experience with his biological family. when brought to her attention that [x] had a positive fifteen-minute experience, her reply was: “he was also one at the time. i’m not sure how it would go now”. it therefore is imperative that the contact happen and continue as soon as possible because if the court accepts the evidence of [ms hh] and even the mother, it is likely to become more difficult. the mother admits that in general it is good for children to have relationships with their parents where it is safe to do so. where in dispute it is for the court to determine whether there a safety risk and where possible make orders to accommodate them. whilst the mother acknowledges the positive aspect of father/son contact in principle she completed her evidence by saying “i don’t know that i’ve still heard any evidence as to how [x] would benefit from the contact with [mr abberley]”. it is clear that the mother is simply just against contact because she wants her sydney family dynamic to prevail which involves excluding the [x]/father relationship. she also completely ignores the court’s role. the mother says that [x] reacted well to meeting cousins, uncles and other relatives. she emphasised that: “[x] has had contact with these people for a few years”. this supports the expert evidence that the contact should be sooner rather than later. it is workable for [mr gg] to deliver [x] to supervised contact and the mother would not try to interfere with that. furthermore, there would be no need for the mother to interact, take photos or anything of a like nature. the mother admits that in her view the father would not go to a home where she lives because of fears of her putting an avo on him. this can be a solution: the court impose an order that the father be advised where [x] is living but is not to approach the address without the written consent of the mother. by inference she believes that it could work. the mother does not believe that father would be physically violent towards [x]. the mother claims that if she and the father had just a normal breakup that she could see no reason that [x] and his father could not have a father/son relationship. the breakup has long past, both have moved on, even on her reasoning there is no reason for father and son not to have a relationship. the need for the mother to punish the father is of no material relevance and actually would be punishing [x]. the mother says that if she were advised by a professional that [x] needs to know and what age and how it is to be done, that is what she will do because she wants what is best for [x]. this evidence is before the court and it can take place at a contact centre for as long as necessary. there is no need to delay contact because she prefers a different expert. the mother’s concern is whether current contact professionals are appropriately qualified. there is nothing against the mother directly communicating with the centres so that they can discuss anything that might concern her. there is no need to delay father/son contact: especially where there is no identifiable risk. the mother failed to comply with an order to undertake a course until the last moment. even then she decided it didn’t really seem like a fitting course to do. she does not know the name of the course she allegedly completed [in mid] 2023. she makes no reference to it in her subsequent affidavit, it was clearly an overthought to combat any suggestion of non-compliance. the certificate was not served until commencement of the hearing. the mother agrees that she failed to comply with the order to provide a photograph of the father once a week: one of the reasons is that she could not see the benefit to her. she also claimed that it was her last link to the father. yet when it is suggested that the father get day care/school reports, all of a sudden the link to father problems vanishes as she says: “i would be happy to pass those on to him”. if the father took his own photos at a contact centre and the day care/school forwarded information directly, all these alleged risks would be non-existent. during cross examination by the icl, the mother creates problems then relies on those problems being barriers to contact. it is clear that her irrational position about risk, even if genuinely believed, is likely to create anxiety in [x], especially her intention to paint the father in a poor light. the mother claims the right, without rational reason, to withhold the address and important details of [x] from his father. she then relies on this unilateral decision as a central theme to opposing father/son contact. without genuine objective reasons, the court should not assist with withholding this information. the mother accepts that: “the court has so far allowed me to not disclose my address to him and so, if they though it was necessary for him to have it, he would have it”. it is clear that now the mother has morphed her view that the father should not have her address into being that of the court’s. there seems to be an acceptance that if the court were of the view that the father should know where his son is living that it would do so. there is no reason that the father should not know the address of his son and what daycare he is attending. if this is released within a very short period, the mother will learn that there is nothing to fear and it could go a long way to overcome that part of her anxiety, if indeed it is genuine. there is no reason in principle why [x] and his father should not have a meaningful relationship. [x] is at no risk of harm even when being alone with the father. the mother has made it clear that there is no suggestion that the father would attempt to physically harm or kidnap [x]. the mother is basically claiming ownership of [x]. everything is her way, even if it means breaching court orders. she will not accept advice with which she disagrees: especially anything that involves [x] and the father establishing a meaningful relationship. the mother will say what needs to be said if she believes it is in her interests. for example: a) volunteering suggestions about contact locations to assist with her relocation application when it is clear that she always would be resisting it. b) when it appears that she is not likely to succeed with a no-time order, moving from no identification to limited identification which: is to be controlled by her, an seems to fly in the face of the assertion that the mere thought of raising the father’s name causes her stress. if the court were to make meaningful contact orders, over time there is the real probability that things would settle down, because [x] would know who his father is and the mother would finally realise that her campaign to keep the father out of [x]’s life would be to no avail. there is a real chance that by depriving [x] of contact and a meaningful relationship with the father could cause irreparable damage. whereas, even if the mother suffers some personal temporary inconvenience, it would be in the best interests of [x]. the mother has run this case substantially on how she perceived she was mistreated in the past mostly through communications. it has nothing to do with the relationship of the father and son. it is all about her. her case is not that the father will harm the child, it is more that if she does not get her way, it might impact upon the way she will, or is prepared, to effectively be a primary care giver. the evidence is clear that notwithstanding all that is happening, [x] seems to be thriving. the stress of the mother has not impacted on [x] and shows no sign of impacting her ability to be a primary caregiver. there is no evidence to suggest that this will change if [x] is allowed contact with his father. the mother clearly has no concept of [x]’s right to a meaningful relationship with his father. when one has children, a parent gives up certain rights which includes a degree of privacy unless a court orders that it is necessary to protect for other reasons, for example the risk of violence. the mother claims that almost the mere mention of the father causes anxiety, yet she was proactive in getting child support, and was most critical when she thought that the father reduced his employment to pay less. this course went beyond merely satisfying government requirements. furthermore, whilst criticising the father for wanting to know too much about her, she seems to take a keen interest in the father’s financial circumstances and then, contrary to anxiety, finds it necessary to include in her affidavit. the father pays child support by lodging money each month. there is no direct debit. when the mother stood to financially benefit, it was most important to her that the father met his duty. the court might find that if the circumstances meet with her convenience eg. financial gain or assistance, the mother seems not to have a problem with the father being involved with the child. it does not seem to impact on her mental health. recognition time this should not simply be a case of knowing who is the father, it should be a case of establishing a meaningful relationship. there is nothing, other than the mother’s unwillingness to cooperate, to justify limiting contact to recognition time. furthermore, the mother is resisting even this. as a last resort, she may tolerate a position provided she has full control of how recognition time is to take place. there is no way of properly monitoring this. it would be far more productive to have a more robust and meaningful contact regime because it is not so much a case of managing the relationship between father and son but one of placating the mother. one would hope that if she sees the positive of the developing relationship between father and son, that she would embrace building on it. conclusion there are some realities regarding parenting and children. when parents have children, their lives change forever. they will most likely be in each other’s lives at least to a degree forever. both parents love their children and want to maximise their time with them. it is important that children have a meaningful relationship with both parents. the paramount consideration is the welfare of the child and what must at all times be incorporated is the integrity of the court. ideally, it is most beneficial if parents can reach agreement on how this is to work. if not, courts will make the decision which must be obeyed. by virtue of having young children, parents give up a degree of their privacy. the need to interfere with a child’s right to a meaningful relationship with a parent should be cautiously exercised: especially when the suggestion is that there should be no contact with parents. the mother wants a new life with a partner where the biological father is wiped from existence, except for the purposes of paying child support. the father is willing to accept that there may be an impact on [ms clement] in having to deal with him and supports the solution that [mr gg] facilitate visitations. not only does this show responsible insight but it is a viable suggestion that was raised in the family report. it is child focussed. the objective evidence is that there is no risk of danger to [x] or the mother and that the mother simply wants the father out of the life of [x]. as far as she is concerned her new partner should be [x]’s only father. the court has made it clear that it can accommodate any genuine risks and even fears she may hold. she is not interested in such a course because it would interfere with the underlying desire not to have the biological father in the life of [x]. delaying contact between father/son does not benefit [x], it placates the mother who perceives her benefit as paramount as was the case of taking photos. alternatively, it prolongs the anxiety of the mother as opposed to addressing it. the mother has made it clear that in her view the father should not have contact. the time has come to assist in having her change her thinking. there is no suggestion that without court intervention the mother will change her position. undoubtedly, because there is no consequence of her not complying with orders, there is no incentive to move towards creating a meaningful relationship. the evidence is clear that: over time the mother’s resolve to keep [x] from having contact will increase. d) there is no actual issue about safety. at best it is an irrational fear, at the worst it is a pretext to keep the father out of the life at [x]. it is tragic that a father who has no record of violence and does not even have an evidentially low threshold family violence order against him, is being treated as if he is violent based on unreasonable views held by the mother. e) one is justified in questioning whether the mother’s perceived fear is actually genuine or whether she is trying to cloak an ulterior motive by unsupported catchphrases. if it were simply as a matter of fear, one would not expect comments such as the mother only wants [mr gg] to be [x]’s father and the threat that if she is compelled to speak of the biological father to [x] she is going to tell “the truth” about him being unsafe. this has nothing to do with safety. f) the approach that is in the best interests of x is for contact to be advanced and not delayed. g) the mother should be encouraged to seek psychological assistance but contact should not be conditional on the mother advancing this. what is certain is that the mother’s conduct is going to adversely affect [x] as he grows older. one cannot help suspecting that once a relationship between [x] and his father is established that it is more likely that the mother will adjust her thinking. h) the mother had a most positive experience in meeting her biological parents. the time that she has lost can never be regained. she has no concept of the damage non-contact will most likely have on [x].

written submissions on behalf of the respondent mother
brief factual history the parties commenced a relationship in [late] 2017 and cohabitated for a very brief period [in mid] 2018. at the time they stopped living together there was a physical altercation between them where the father tried to stop the mother from leaving by placing his arm around her shoulders or neck. during the relationship the mother experienced 2 miscarriages which she found distressing and traumatic. the parties continued a relationship while not living together until they separated [in early] 2019. the mother discovered she was pregnant with the subject child, [x], [shortly] after separation and informed the father of her pregnancy. the mother says that the father limited her interaction with friends, accessed her mobile phone without her consent and otherwise engaged in controlling conduct throughout the relationship. the father sent a barrage of abusive, harassing, threatening and offensive messages to the mother after separation between [early] 2019, despite her requests for him to desist from that conduct. the message included request that she abort the pregnancy and wishes for her to miscarry. the father was aware, from the others earlier miscarriages, that stress could cause miscarriage. the father says, in his material, that type of behaviour ended in [early] 2019, however conceded in cross examination that his behaviour continued without a break throughout 2019 until after [x]’s birth and was likely to have been experienced as harassing by the mother. the father agrees he messaged the mother’s [sports] instructor to leave her alone, that he had a problem with her having male friends, that he went through her phone to control her communication with others and that following separation he took a number of steps to put pressure on the mother. those steps included repeated attempts to contact her directly after she and the nsw police told him to stop, attempts to contact her through her family and friends in the knowledge that those messages or attempts would become known to the mother, seeking orders that the mother be required to disclose [x]’s address and “all persons that reside at or frequent the address and the name of whoever cares for [x]”, seeking orders at different stages of the proceedings that the mother relocate to live closer to him, his use of his sister as agent to obtain information about the mother including at the hospital and at supervised contact, as reported to the court child expert, and the evidence he filed in support of his case. the mother relocated from [region g] to [city kk] in [late] 2019 for two reasons: to assist her father with health issues and to get away from the father’s harassment. the mother was assaulted by her father in [late] 2019 and moved house to avoid the father discovering her location shortly prior to [x]’s birth. the mother’s father [...] contacted the father to provide details of the mother’s whereabouts and birth of the child. [x] was born at [mm hospital] [in late] 2019. special security measures were put in place by the hospital to protect the mother from the father. [in] 2019, the father and his sister visited [city kk], including attending at the mother’s former rental property, and attending [mm hospital] to find out details about the mother and [x]. the father’s sister entered the hospital and obtained that information without the mother’s knowledge or consent. at the time this was done, the father knew his approach to the hospital would be unwelcome. [in] 2019, the father renewed his enquiry about the mother to her former landlord. the father commenced proceedings [soon after] [x]’s birth, [in] 2019. on 2 december 2019, orders were made by judge myers for the mother to provide a photo to the father once a week. the mother complied with this order between 5 december 2019 and march 2023, despite some email correspondence received from the father that she experiences as abusive, threatening and harassing. the father agreed that some of his email communication to the mother in response to the photographs were likely to put pressure on her but says that he was unwell at the time. there was one period of supervised time between the child and the father on 16 april 2021. the mother’s distress about the visit prior to time commencing limited the time available from 30 minutes to 15 minutes and remains the only time [x] and the father have spent together. the mother was very affected by the process and was unable to facilitate further time, however commenced seeing [dr q] in may 2021 to assist her in facilitating future time. orders were made in october 2021 providing for the father to commence supervised time with [x] once he had undertaken six months of clear drug screens and provided a report from his treating psychologist as to his progress in addressing the concerns set out in the mother’s affidavit and the report of [mr m]. in the more than 18 months between those orders and the final hearing, the father took no such steps. notwithstanding her attempts to obtain assistance from psychotherapist [ms p] since [late] 2018 and psychologist [dr q] since may 2021, the mother remains frightened of the father and highly anxious about his spending time with [x]. her fears have resulted in panic attacks during the recent preparation for the final hearing and meant that she has required assistance from extended family to parent her children. issues in contention whether the father’s behaviour towards the mother constitutes family violence within the meaning of the family law act. the relevance of [x]’s right to a meaningful relationship with both parents in terms of whether any in person time between the child and the father meets his best interest given: the father’s conduct towards the mother, and his failure to take any positive step in accordance with the interim orders made on 20 october 2021, and his failure to take any positive step in answer to any of the recommendations of [ms hh]. whether there is an actual benefit to [x] in spending in person time with the father that is additional to the benefit to [x] of knowing factually that he has a biological father. whether [x]’s right to a meaningful relationship with both parents is subservient, in this case, to the risk to him of a detrimental impact on his primary carer that will likely arise from any orders for time. assessment of the evidence as it relates to the issues in contention and the orders sought by the mother the father’s evidence was self-serving and lacked insight into the consequences of his behaviour on the mother. he maintained the position that the mother is exaggerating her fear of him. although he spoke about ‘i take full responsibility’, he also talked about being unwell, being emotional, having a difficult time and that he was ‘still not very rational’ until recently. that evidence of his emotional or psychological struggles is of significant concern in the context of these proceedings, particularly given the lack of evidence of any action taken by the father following the orders made on 20 october 2021: no evidence from his psychologist of improved psychological function, no evidence of his providing the mother’s affidavit to his psychologist to assist with his therapeutic engagement, no drug testing of any kind after 21 november 2021, no medical evidence to explain his lack of hair follicle testing. additionally, issues raised in the family report about drug testing, psychological assistance and engagement with a course focussed on men’s behaviour change, could have reassured the mother about the benefit to [x] of time with the father, yet none were prioritised by him, leading the mother to confirm her belief that the father must have things his way or not at all. the father’s messaging, directly to the mother [in early] 2019, as well as to her friends and family after that date, including in his email to her immediately after the birth, is family violence within the act. his admissions as to controlling conduct through limiting her friendships and going through her phone, is family violence within the act. the mother’s evidence about her experience was cogent, detailed and compelling, and was unassailed under cross examination. in a contest between the parent’s evidence about the alleged physical violence in [mid]-2018, the mother’s evidence would be accepted. the father admitted to substantial abuse and harassment of the mother post separation but rationalised this as evidence of his poor mental health and, later, his attempts to know about his child. the definition of family violence in s4ab focuses on the impact on the victim and not on the mental state of the perpetrator. from prior to the commencement of proceedings, the father knew that the mother did not want him to know her address. once proceedings commenced, the father had positive evidence from the mother that she wished her exact location to remain private. that request was granted by the court and the mother was not required to provide her address. none of the father’s requests to be provided with those details were granted. but the father did not stop trying to find the mother’s address and continued to give her the message “i know where you live”, though his affidavit material and in his comments recorded in the family reports. those circumstances are important context for the court’s assessment of the father’s evidence around his knowledge of her address at different periods of the litigation, and his ‘comfort’ or ‘content’ in knowing the address despite her protestations. the father’s attempts included interrogating the background of photographs of the child to confirm address details, the disturbing questioning of the mother as to the steps available to find her location, and the inclusion in his trial affidavit of his assessment of the mother’s current location based on the comments made in court in september 2021 and who knows what other enquiry or steps the father may have taken to discover or confirm the mother’s whereabouts. disturbingly, a large percentage of the father’s submissions, presumably on instructions, address the right of the father to know the child’s address, school etc. the father’s approach to this issue grounds a finding that the father has historically stalked the mother and will likely do so again. the mother was physically assaulted, harassed, threatened, stalked and subjected to surveillance. her fear of the father is rationally formed on her own experience and the father has done little to provide evidence of change. the outcome of findings as to family violence is twofold. it rebuts any presumption that the parents are to share parental responsibility, conceded in any event, and it provides the context for the mother’s clinical anxiety around dealing with any order for [x] to spend time with the father. while assessed as low risk in a supervised setting by the court child expert, the father’s prior conduct must raise a risk that he will return to such conduct again. the evidence of the impact on the mother of orders for time is covered in her own affidavit, in the reports and oral evidence of [dr q], in the report and oral evidence of the family consultant and in the evidence that was available at the interim hearing. of some significance is the mother’s fears specifically as to the safety risk of supervised time occurring, namely: that the father may place someone not known to her in the area of the supervision centre to follow her home to find her address. on the factual history, that fear is rational, that the father may make comments to the child that are negative about the mother, thereby confusing [x]. the father was uncontained in his attitude towards the mother in his text and email communication to her and others. he was uncontained in his attitude towards the mother in the family report interviews in november 2020 and november 2022. there is no evidence to suggest he will be able to contain those views around [x]. that in their normal conversation, the father may seek, or the child may volunteer, information that identifies the mother’s address or the child’s school. again, on the factual history up to and including the final hearing, that fear is rational. added to those fears are the limited evidence of a positive benefit to [x] of the time occurring and the significant evidence of a detrimental impact on the mother’s psychological health. the mother has undertaken extensive work with psychologists over many years to assist her in processing her experience of the father’s behaviour and in accepting the potential for orders for time. [dr q’s] evidence is useful due to its longitudinal engagement as evidenced in her two reports, one at the commencement of her work with the mother and the other very recent and after 2 years of treatment. while [dr q] was able to hypothesise one last therapy that could potentially assist, namely emdr, she was otherwise of the opinion that any orders for time between [x] and the father will cause harm to the mother and negatively impact on her parenting. to refer to this likely outcome as “personal temporary inconvenience" minimises the evidence of risk to the mother’s mental health as well as the consequential impact on [x]. the evidence of the court child expert, [ms hh], identified two potential benefits to [x] of [mr abberley]. the first was that for [x]’s sense of identity and understanding of his family, he should know that he has a biological father other than the man he has as his psychological father, with that information being given to him sooner rather than later to avoid a potential detriment to his self-concept in the future. the second benefit was less certain and more hypothetical, in that some children are assisted to have a real person to whom they attach the theoretical concept of biological parentage. she was unable to say if [x] was such a child but if so, said that a couple of identity visits a year, if able to be managed by the mother, would potentially provide that benefit to [x]. crucially, for such time between [x] and the father to be positive, it would need the mother’s positive support or else risk being harmful for him. like [dr q], [ms hh] was concerned about the mother’s ability to cope with any orders for time between [x] and the father and indicated that if the mother could not positively support recognition contact then it should not go ahead. based on the mother’s evidence, the court would be satisfied that she would attempt to comply with orders made for time but would have little confidence that her attempts to positively support recognition contact would be successful. the mother amended her orders to make clear that she will be telling [x] about his biological father in the manner discussed in [ms hh]’s evidence, and that to assist [x] with understanding his identity, she will facilitate the provision of cards, letters, or a parcel from the father to [x] twice each year. this was considered by [ms hh] as a good middle ground. primary considerations (section 60cc of the family law act) the father seeks routine orders for a rapid build-up of time to reach a point where it will be possible for [x] to develop a meaningful relationship with the father. while of course the court must assess that proposal, the orders sought by the father are impracticable in the circumstances of the matter and do not recognise the detrimental impact such a regime would cause to [x]’s primary carer. following the interim hearing determination in october 2021, the father was on notice of the kind of evidence he should bring about his circumstances to assist the court to assess a positive benefit to [x] of time with the father. the result of the father’s failure to do so means that the court is asked to assess that benefit on little more than biology. orders as recommended by the court child expert and those proposed by the mother do not provide for a meaningful relationship between [x] and the father. the history in this case, set out in helpful detail in the interim judgement, are analogous to the factual matrix set out in lim & zong. in that case, the potential benefit to the child when weighed against the risk to the child’s primary carer, resulted in orders for no time. [ms clement] asserts that [x] spending time with the father presents an unacceptable risk by way of aspects of the father’s functioning, about which the court has no independent evidence, but primarily by way of the impact on her arising from his past behaviour. the court is referred to cases such as keane and keane and mandall & camdyn (no 2) for recent discussion of the inextricable link between the welfare of the child and the welfare of the child’s primary carer. it is noted that the father’s harassing messages and stalking behaviour as asserted by the mother must be seen in the context of her acknowledged vulnerability to mental health decline and the impact this could have on [x]. the mother says that the risk to the child cannot be adequately mitigated such that any time between the child and the father could be considered ‘safe’. however, in the event that the court were to make orders for supervised time, the prior conditions such as drug testing and psychological reporting should be continued. other considerations section 60cc (3) the child does not have a current relationship with the father. the court would likely be concerned as to the impact on his relationship with his mother in the event that orders as sought by the father are made. the father, in spite of protestations to ensure support of the mother, demurred from accepting responsibility for child support until a declaration was obtained by the mother [in late] 2020, following which he stopped working. his evidence around signing the birth certificate and grudgingly accepting responsibility for child support was far from satisfactory. the mother asserts that the court would be concerned as to the father’s conduct during the litigation in this matter, commencing shortly after the child’s birth, including his orders sought, the type of material filed in his case and the steps taken (and not taken) by him. by not following the steps set out in the interim orders, the father has not taken every opportunity to spend time with the child. by not taking any steps to follow the recommendations of the court child expert, the father has not shown a positive attitude to the child, to the responsibility of parenting or to [x]’s other parent:
i think he has already been given that chance and he didn't do it and that has made it worse for me, not better. he has already been offered that – exactly that last time to get the psychological help, produce a report and do the six months clean tests in order to start time and he has had a year and a half to do that he chose to do nothing so that to me spoke strongly to the fact that this is not a priority, especially he was self represented for a lot of it. it feels like he's just dragging me through court for as long as it takes to waste my time and resources, like he originally promised he was going to do.
response to father’s submissions in his submissions, the father asserts that the mother does not comply with court orders. the orders operating on the mother were: order 11 of the orders of 2 december 2019 requiring a photograph to be provided weekly. this was complied with until march 2023 when the mother became too affected by the process of providing weekly photos to continue. in circumstances where no time was occurring, it’s hard to see how the order was of benefit to the child. orders 1-3 of the orders of 18 march 2020, each of which were complied with by the mother, orders 2, 3 and 6 of the orders of 22 march 2021 providing for registering for supervised time (complied with), attending for supervised time (complied with on one occasion) and attendance at a parenting course. these orders were the subject of successful review by the mother, leading to the orders of 20 october 2021. the mother accepts that she was late in her compliance with order 4 of the orders of 20 october 2021 providing for her to undertake a parenting course within 28 days of her relocation. she covered that delay in her evidence at tx p159. in the circumstances of this case, the mother’s lack of compliance with orders pales to insignificance next to the father’s total disregard for orders. comments within the father’s submissions that imply that the mother will not tell [x] about his biological father, to the extent that they are relevant to the determination of the court, ignore the evidence led by the mother, both in her minute of orders sought and in her oral evidence. the submissions, for example at [27], relating to the mother and her partner having a history of drug abuse improperly reflect the evidence in the case. at paragraph 51 of ex #[h]1, [ms hh] reports [mr gg] as referring to using recreational drugs and alcohol when young. use, not abuse. the mother reports using drugs with the father in their relationship, but to a lesser extent than the father, and never since becoming pregnant with [x]. she has provided a clean hair follicle drug screen in accordance with the orders of 18 march 2020. the father has not. their histories of drug use are not nearly in the same league. generally, the submissions seek to attach to the mother particular motivations, inclinations, interests or thought processes not accepted or proved in evidence. to the extent that they are relevant to the determination the court must make, the mother does not concede the beliefs attributed to her in the father’s submissions. submissions made at [57], [114] and [115] mischaracterise the evidence around the payment of child support. far from taking a ‘healthy interest’ in the father complying with his statutory obligation, the mother was happy to never receive anything from the father if, at the same time, it did not impact her entitlement to family tax benefit. the father’s submissions make multiple references to the positive contact that has occurred so far. there has been one visit of 15 minutes more than two years ago when [x] was [one year] old. the idea of ‘building’ on that positive time stretches the evidence. the submission made at [86] is contrary to the evidence that the mother could not, without his involvement, put the father on the birth certificate as advised to her by the hospital staff. whatever inference is attempted by the criticism within the submission is not available. by contrast, the father seeking orders to be included on the birth certificate and then refusing to complete the relevant form out of some sense of spite towards the mother, speaks volumes. conclusion in circumstances where there is no current relationship between [x] and the father and where the history of the father’s conduct, his drug use, and psychological functioning raised questions as to risk, it was for the father to bring evidence of a benefit to [x] of developing a relationship with him. he did not do so. whatever limited, hypothetical benefit to [x] of knowing his biological father may exist, it is outweighed by the evidence of the real risk of detrimental impact on his primary care giver that will in turn detrimentally impact upon [x]. the orders sought by the mother allow [x] to obtain a benefit of knowing that he has a father and obtain some understanding of him, without the corresponding risk to the mother’s mental health. the orders as sought by the mother should be made.
written submissions of the independent children’s lawyer
parental responsibility the parties agree that the mother should have sole parental responsibility for the child. however in his amended initiating application filed 27 june 2023, the father seeks orders that the mother seek his views prior to making any major long-term decision for the child. the mother and the icl propose that the mother should hold sole parental responsibility that is unfettered by any requirement to consult with the father. there is no evidence in either parents’ affidavit material specifically directed to this proposal (noting that the mother’s trial affidavit was filed prior to the father amending his application). the question of parental responsibility was not the subject of any significant evidence at trial. the parents agree that they have had little direct communication since the commencement of proceedings and their communication historically has been very difficult. the father deposes regarding his communication to the mother around the time of separation that he is ‘disgusted by my vulgar and out of control emotional messaging’ and he ‘will always regret the awful things [he] wrote and said’. the mother makes other serious allegations of family violence in her trial affidavit, much of which is denied by the father. nonetheless, the icl submits that the conduct that the father conceded to in his trail affidavit and under cross-examination is sufficient to rebut the presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility. the mother relies on expert evidence from her treating psychologist that should the child spend time with the father, this will cause ‘significant distress to [the mother]’ and ‘trigger her trauma symptoms significantly’ (page 34 of the affidavit of [dr q]). the recommendation of the family report writer [ms hh] at paragraphs 66 & 67 of her report was that the mother should hold sole parental responsibility for the child as it ‘appears that [the mother’s] capacity to focus on [x]’s needs would be hindered if she was required to communicate and negotiate with [the father].’ under cross-examination by the father’s counsel, the mother maintained her position that she could not communicate with the father and held ‘fears around having regular contact’ with the father. at trial and in submissions, the father suggested that the mother’s alleged fears regarding the father are not genuinely held or, to the extent that they are genuine, they are irrational. at the time of writing her report, it was the view of [ms hh] that the father ‘appears to lack insight into [ms clement]’s level of fear’. the icl submits that the weight of the evidence does not support a conclusion that the mother’s reported anxiety regarding communicating with the father has been exaggerated. while the court may or may not be able to form a view as to the factual basis of the mother’s feelings, the evidence of [dr q] supports a conclusion that the mother’s feelings are genuinely held and have persisted despite long-standing therapeutic intervention. in those circumstances, the icl concurs with the view of [ms hh] that an order requiring the mother to consult with the father is likely to have a negative impact on the mother’s parenting capacity. presuming that the court makes orders similar to those as sought by the icl or alternatively orders for limited recognition time as suggested by [ms hh], the father will have no real involvement with the child’s life. the father’s knowledge and experience of the child will be severely limited as a result. even if the father was in a position to provide the mother with valuable input regarding major long-term decisions for the child, the evidence strongly suggests that the mother is unlikely to be open to considering the father’s perspective. in those circumstance, the icl questions how a requirement for the mother to consult the father would benefit the child. should the court nonetheless consider that a requirement to consult may be of some benefit to the child, the icl submits that the likely risks to the mother’s parenting capacity would outweigh such potential benefits. allegations of risk the mother alleges that the father perpetrated significant family violence against her during and after the relationship. the father made concessions in his trial affidavit and under cross examination regarding his communication and conduct towards the mother towards the end of their relationship and for a period of time after the child’s birth in 2019. the matters conceded by the father lend substantial support to the mother’s account of the father’s behaviour towards her. there is no dispute that the father failed to undertake both hair-follicle testing and urinalysis testing as required by the interim orders of 20 october 2021 (except for completing one urinalysis test [in late] 2022 that was positive for [illicit substance] use). the mother asks that the court infer that the father continues to use illicit drugs. her evidence under cross-examination was that such use poses a risk to the child even in the context of professionally supervised time due to the potential impact on the father’s psychological functioning. the mother says that she is fearful of the father and highly anxious about the possibility of him having time with [x], even if professionally supervised, because of the father’s previous behaviour towards her. at trial, the mother’s evidence was that her concerns are heightened by the lack of evidence regarding the father’s mental health and drug use. she contends that despite her significant efforts to address her anxiety regarding the father, she has doubts about her capacity to comply with orders requiring that time occur should they be made. at trial, the mother gave evidence that the possibility that the father would discover her address caused her significant anxiety. the mother also gave evidence regarding her fear that the father would use supervised contact to obtain the mother’s current address (by way of having someone wait outside the contact centre in order to follow [x] home or some other unknown means). in summary, mother alleges that the father is a significant risk to the child, both directly and indirectly by way of the impact on her as the child’s primary carer. notwithstanding some questions put on the father’s behalf at trial and a suggestion in the father’s submissions that the mother’s history of drug use has ‘not been explored’, the father does not appear to press any concern that the child is at risk in the mother’s care (except that she is unwilling to facilitate the chid having a relationship with him). the father denies that he poses any risk to the child. he proposes orders for the immediate commencement of professionally supervised time with a transition to unsupervised day-time time in four months, provided that the father has produced urinalysis results that are negative for all drugs except [illicit substances] (with urinalysis requests by the mother being made no more than once per month). the father does not propose any order regarding him accessing further assistance for his mental health. proposed care arrangements & benefit to the child the father’s ultimate position is that he should spend alternate weekends and half school holidays with the child. the mother and the icl seek orders that the father spend no time with the child and only have written communication with him twice per year. the family report of [ms hh] reflects her view that ‘there appears to be a high likelihood that, if [ms clement] were ordered to facilitate time between [x] and [mr abberley], she would not adhere to orders’ and ‘due to [ms clement]’s inability to facilitate the relationship between [x] and [mr abberley], it seems that the only option is for [x] to spend “recognition time” with father’. [ms hh] went on to recommend that should the court find that recognition time was in the child’s best interests, that this occur at a supervised contact centre, once every six months. the possible benefits to the child if he was to spend recognition time with the father and the conditions under which the child would actually benefit from such time were canvassed at length with ms hh at trial. ms hh’s evidence under cross-examination by the icl was that the child would benefit from spending time with the father in person as this would give the child a ‘more concrete understanding of this person who is his father which might help him in terms of his sense of identity and making sense of his world.’ under cross-examination from counsel for the mother, [ms hh] concurred with counsel’s summation that the benefit to [x] in having recognition time was ‘a potential benefit but it’s difficult to know or crystalise [the benefit].’ [ms hh] clarified that she also considered that it would potentially harm the child not to know his family history. following a discussion of the psychological treatment the mother had already accessed, [ms hh] went on to say that ‘the mother’s view [...] was that she does not think it is in [x]’s interests to have any relationship with his father. i think while she holds that view it’s very unlikely that she will develop the skills to support the relationship.’ [ms hh] then concluded that ‘there’s no reason for [the mother] to develop skills for something she sees as harmful to her child.’ the mother amended her position to include orders allowing the father to send the child written communication after considering the evidence of [ms hh] gave on the first day of trial. this included [ms hh]’s firmly expressed opinion that it is was vital for [x] to some knowledge of his biological father and her view that ‘if the mother is not able to be supportive of that recognition time, [written communication] might be a good middle ground.’ the evidence of the mother’s treating psychologist [dr q] regarding what mother could do to alleviate her anxiety was that ‘i think [ms clement] becomes triggered and extremely anxious and overwhelmed at even the thought of [x] having contact with his father’ and ‘i don’t think anything would reassure her of [x]’s safety.' in his trial affidavit and during cross-examination, the father maintained his position that the child will benefit from being allowed to know him as his father and developing a meaningful relationship with him. in submissions, the father argues that ‘the father is willing to accept that there may be an impact on [the mother] in having to deal with him and supports the solution that [the mother’s partner] [mr gg] facilitate visitations.’ this proposal was made by [ms hh] in her report. the family report records [mr gg] stating that he does not support [x] being told that [mr abberley] is his biological father as he considers that ‘i’m dad and always will be.’ [mr abberley] went on to say that he is ‘terrified’ of the child spending time with the father, but that he would facilitate the child spending time ‘if [ms clement] asked him.’ [mr gg] was not put on affidavit in the proceedings and did not give evidence at trial. [ms hh]’s evidence when questioned by the icl was that she did not identify any risk that [mr gg] would speak inappropriately to [x]. whether [mr gg] would actively attempt to influence the child or not, the strength of [mr gg]’s views regarding the father suggests that his involvement would not be enthusiastic or significantly supportive. the balance of [ms hh]’s evidence reflects that for a regime of recognition time to benefit the child, it is necessary for both the mother and [mr gg] to recognise that benefit and be willing (and able) to act on that knowledge. father’s conduct during the proceedings the father’s non-compliance with the regime of drug testing ordered by the court over a period in excess of 18-months is concerning on several fronts. the father’s initial reason for his non-compliance with the interim orders for hair‑follicle testing made on 28 october 2021 was that even at the time those orders were made he was unable to comply with them due to a medical condition. the father’s initial reason for non-compliance with urinalysis testing was that he could not afford the costs involved. notwithstanding this, the father’s current proposal is that he undertake a four-month regime of urinalysis testing once supervised time recommences. the father has not taken the opportunity to spend time with the child via the pathway open to him in the current interim orders. though the father asserted a variety of reasons why he was unable to take up that opportunity in later correspondence, the father agreed under cross-examination by the icl that he did not advise the court or the parties of this inability at the time the orders were made or at any other time up until october 2022, some 12 months later. the father’s evidence under further cross-examination by the icl was to the effect that he was not willing to take on the practical and financial difficulties of taking drug tests because he felt that his time with the child was not guaranteed. relevantly, the forceful submissions of the father’s counsel include the following statements: ‘the mother has made it clear that she has no interest in assisting with creating any father/son relationship’ and ‘the mother cannot be trusted to comply with orders of the court.’ on the assumption that his submissions reflect the father’s personally held views, it is difficult to see how the present situation is materially different to what the father has been facing for the last 18 months. though the father now asserts he will take ‘any time that [he] can get, the evidence otherwise suggests that father will decline to spend time with the child unless it occurs in a manner acceptable to him. conclusion based on all of the evidence read in the matter and the testing of the evidence by way of examination and cross examination, the icl submits in summary as follows: where the potential benefits of the child having in-person time with the father are outweighed by the likely impact on the mother’s parenting capacity, it is in the best interests of the child to spend no time with the father and that the mother hold sole parental responsibility with no requirement to consult the father. to ensure that the child is told that the father is his biological father as recommended by [ms hh], it is appropriate that the mother’s proposal on how to share this information with the child be included as an order rather than a notation. the icl also proposes an order requiring the mother to inform the father that when this has occurred. the icl considers this necessary given that the mother’s position up to the second day of trial was that the child should not be told about the identify of his biological father. where the father remains of the view that the mother is exaggerating her fears of him in order to frustrate him having a relationship with the child and to alleviate the mother’s anxiety regarding receiving communication from the father, an order should be made limiting the content of that communication. consequential orders should then follow regarding how and when the father’s communication is provided to the child and specifying that the father be informed if any communication is not provided.
written submissions in reply of the applicant father
a) it is not child focused, it is about accommodating the mother. there is no criticism of the lengths the mother has gone to geographically separate [x] from his father but significant criticism about the father wanting to know about his child. b) there is no evidence of risk to [x] by having contact with his father. there is no danger to the mother or the child for the father to know the address of the child and details of health and schooling. c) any challenge to the mother’s motive or actions is met with the suggestion that the father lacks insight into the mother’s needs and is stalking her. d) the mother has been allowed to effectively control the narrative with unfounded allegations. expert have been urged to change their position not because of anything the father or child has done but to accommodate the mother’s resistance to proposed suggestions. e) due to the mother’s immovable position, the highest the icl and the mother can make in relation to concerns about the father relates to reactions by the mother of the father trying to find out about his son. the mother goes to great lengths to hide the child and then criticizes the father for trying to find him. the mother sees this as stalking whilst it is clear that the father has no interest in the mother but wants a relationship with his child. the mother refuses to entertain options where she has no contact with the father when the child and father are to meet. f) offers to minimize her involvement with creating a relationship between father and child is met with resistance or in the alternative giving her full control of how this is to happen in private. the suggestion that the mother will advance a relationship between [x] and his father in secret is fanciful. social workers and institutions should play the dominant role. g) whilst the father’s conduct is examined at a micro level, the mother’s unilateral decision to exclude the child from any relationship with the father or his family is not only substantially ignored but is the premise for her application to exclude. there is nothing material since final separation that warrants the orders being advanced by the mother and icl. for example, any risk of denigration comes from the mother and not the father. h) there is no plan to resolve the mother’s inability to cope with the idea of the father and child having a relationship: her solution is simple, the father should be excluded from the child’s life. any alleged negative impact of the relationship is not brought about by the contact between child/father but the mother’s reaction to any such contact.

outline of principle
... maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents, obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement having been incurred.
... it must not be assumed that one parent (the father) cannot move and that the mother must, in every case, subordinate her ambitions and wishes, not to the needs of the child, but to the wishes of the father to pursue his life in a place of his choosing. it is the interests of the child which are paramount, not the interests or needs of the parents, let alone the interests of one of them.  4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. "[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms." because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be "best" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing.
on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.” on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.   the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(2))  ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s.60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues:
the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility.  ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words “meaningful involvement”. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting:
the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision-making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements.  ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]–[199]):  6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) — (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than “1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays” or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve “both” parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children.  ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system”. “meaning” is defined as “having intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)”. a second definition is “conveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive”. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines “meaning” (in generalised use) as “significance”. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as “full of meaning, significant”. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as “expressive or significant: a meaning look”. [26] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.
we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o’ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]:
the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a “meaningful relationship” with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court’s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child’s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider “the benefit to the child” of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j’s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original)
the full court also observed at [191]: “the first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression ‘meaningful relationship’ is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a ‘meaningful relationship’ ”.
