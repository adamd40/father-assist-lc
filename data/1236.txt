report of ms bc
recommendations, if any, in relation to any support that should be provided to [x], the mother and/or the father with respect to [x] being informed that [mr marella] is his birth father and his reintroduction to the father, noting that it is understood that [x] currently believes his father is [mr as] and he may be using a different surname than [marella]. 19. as outlined above in regard to first part of the inquiry. it should be noted that [mr marella] has inquired and been advised by [x’s] school authorities that [x] is known as and referred to as [x marella] in all aspects of his school life. there appears to be contradictory information about whether [x] views his younger half-brother’s father, [mr as], as his biological father. in her report, [ms ay] indicated that [x] has a close relationship with his maternal grandfather who he refers to as ‘dad’ which might suggest that he does not view [ms marella’s] partner/prior partner as his biological father. any general/mental health supports to be provided to [x] in light of his current circumstances a referral to a child psychologist may be beneficial for [x] which has been suggested by [ms ay]. [mr marella] indicated that he has accessed a clinical child psychologist who has indicated they are willing to provide a service to assist [x] and provide [mr marella] with strategies to help [x’s] adjustment, if [x] were moved into his primary care. a referral to the ‘[bd program]’ children’s group work program may benefit [x]. it is an intervention program that strengthens emotional wellbeing of children and young people who are dealing with change, loss and grief in their life. the program, if available in [city c], is generally offered each school term and there may be a period of months before it becomes available for [x]. the likely impact on [x] of the mother failing to comply with court orders and/or failing to participate in the proceedings and whether this impacts and/or alters any recommendations made by the court child expert [ms marella] has clearly indicated to the court that she will not comply with court orders that involves a re-introduction of [mr marella] to [x]. [ms marella] did, however, comply with orders to participate in a therapeutic intervention to introduce the concept of a biological father which included making [x] available for seven sessions and participating in an individual session. the benefits to [x] in relation to learning about [mr marella] and spending time with him and developing a relationship with [mr marella] are considerable. providing [x] with an opportunity to know [mr marella] may help develop a better sense of his identity, his sense of self and potentially increase his feelings of self-worth and value. it will also expose [x] to a wider network of family members and the potential for close relationships with his extended paternal family including his grandparents, aunts/uncles and cousins which will develop and be available to him into adulthood. [mr marella] is culturally of [country ak] background and [x] may gain a better understanding of his culture and heritage on his paternal side. if [mr marella] is correct, it is feasible that if not currently the case with the passage of time, [x] may inadvertently learn via school peers, by overhearing comments in the maternal households, or through local community members that he has a biological father and extended paternal family members that he has not been given an opportunity to know. if the case, it may impact on his feelings of trust and security within regard to [ms marella] and whatever explanation she may provide to him is unknown. children who do not know a parent sometimes develop fantasies about that parent which may become quite grandiose and intense. in addition, children sometimes experience a void or sense of lacking which they may carry into adulthood. the mother’s capacity to support a relationship between [x] and his father, given the history of the relationship between the parents. the writer is not in a position to comment directly on the mother’s capacity to support a relationship between [x] and his father. the report from [ms ay] appeared to indicate that [ms marella] was triggered by the mention of [mr marella] being introduced as [x’s] father and that she emotionally dysregulated when this occurred. it further appears [x] has been adversely affected when he was required to participate in counselling with [ms ay]. as stated, [ms ay] reported that [ms marella] ‘become very emotional’ when the concept of introducing [mr marella] was raised and when this occurred ‘[x] needed to be removed from the room and supported by secondary staff’. [ms ay] reported that [x] would become distressed when [ms marella] was asked to stay outside, ‘his behaviour was hypervigilant’ and he ‘shut doing continually requesting to go home’. the general care and impact on [x] of him remaining in the mother’s care. the writer is not able to comment on the general day to day care parental care provided to [x] by [ms marella]. in her report, [ms ay] indicated that when [x] presented to her for counselling, ‘all observations and information provided from the mother confirmed [x] was meeting all his developmental milestones according to age’. she reported ‘he was well groomed, good hygiene and appropriate size and physical stature’. currently, [x] does not have an emotional connection with [mr marella] and in his world view his family comprises of his maternal family members. the positive impact of [x] on remaining in [ms marella’s] care is considerable, she has provided his primary care since infancy and he will be able to maintain his sense of security, stability and ongoing warm relationships with his mother, younger half-brother, [az], and his maternal grandparents and extended maternal family members. without further intervention and based on information available to the writer [x] will probably be raised in a stable home environment where he feels loved and emotionally safe and secure over the longer term free from exposure to high parental conflict and the adverse impacts of ongoing litigation on his mother and her parenting and likewise on him. furthermore, the protection of [x’s] relationship with [ms marella] may best provide a strong and safe foundation for [x’s] emotional wellbeing and development. a protected and safe, secure and nurturing childhood will generally allow a child to grow into young adulthood with stronger personality functioning and less burden of trauma, which may provide them with a better opportunity for healthy life outcomes and good adjustment. it may also be a better foundation from which to commence and maintain an adult relationship with the father. the father’s capacity to meet [x’s] physical, emotional and psychological needs if [x] was placed in the father’s care. [mr marella] has not demonstrated that he is able to sole parent [x] or any child to date, he lacks parenting expertise and his capacity to parent appropriately is untested. the reality is that [mr marella] has not been given an opportunity to parent [x]. [mr marella] presents as a competent and responsible adult and he has demonstrated during litigation that he is highly motivated and committed to being a father to [x]. [mr marella] has accessed numerous professional services and programs including parenting education programs and a post separation parenting program, as outlined in his affidavit material. [mr marella] spoke about having communicated directly with [x’s] school authorities about [x] and his needs. he indicated that he had already sought a referral for a child psychologist to assist [x] and him to care for [x], if he is moved into his care. in regard to his mental health, [mr marella] has sought and received treatment for his mental health and sustained this over time. his psychiatrist has provided updated reports to the court which indicates that they have no concerns for his parenting capacity. [mr marella] intends to live with the paternal grandparents with [x] and they are available for support and assistance should and when this is needed. in addition, the paternal aunt and uncle have indicated a willingness to provide support to [mr marella]. [mr marella] indicated that this will help him and provide some respite from the full time care of [x]. from [mr marella’s] account, which appeared genuine, he would use his best endeavours to support [x’s] needs. [mr marella] acknowledges the significant challenges that he will face and the likely adverse emotional impacts on [x]. he said that he appreciates that [x] will likely exhibit a range of problematic behavioural and emotional responses about being compelled to live in a completely unknown environment with adults that he does not know and where he does not want to be. [mr marella] reported that he will show [x] care, love, compassion and reassurance and access all possible supports available to him to help [x] to adjust. on the other hand, [mr marella] is unlikely to appreciate the depths of the challenges he may experience and the level of distress, anguish and emotional and behavioural difficulties [x] may display. managing such a situation will be a very demanding parental burden for the most resilient adult. [mr marella] and the paternal grandparents’ coping may become rapidly exhausted and the demands of [x] may be difficult for him to manage. the impact upon [x] of being removed from the mother’s household and placed with the father. for [x] to be abruptly and forcibly removed from [ms marella’s] care, his primary caregiver and likely significant attachment figure will be a significantly disturbing experience for [x] and likely cause him to experience trauma and potentially overwhelming loss and grief. in reality, the scene itself of the removal will be drastically alarming for [x] and may require police involvement. [x] will be taken from his secure base, his familiar home environment and moved into an environment where the parties are completely unknown and unfamiliar to him. it appears that [x] does not know that there is a biological father, [mr marella] however even if this were the case, there is no existing relationship. to remove a child from their family of origin will result in a significant loss for the child and it is not taken lightly including in child protection matters where generally this occurs as a last resort when the child is considered at unacceptable risk and there is no other available means to mitigate such risk. [x] will have a substantial experience of loss and life adversity which has the potential to significantly affect his emotional and psychological functioning in the short and longer term, as well as his ability to form and maintain important relationships during his life. there may be life-long adverse impacts and poor life outcomes related to [x’s] experience of loss. how [x] might react is unknown but he could present with behavioural and emotional dysregulation, either externalising or internalising (acting out/acting in) and significantly test limits. [x] will likely experience confusion, potentially feelings of abandonment or rejection by his mother, anxiety and worry, depression and in the worse scenario he might self-harm. in regard to his education and cognition, there could be decreased academic performance, preoccupation and inability to concentrate. there might be impacts on his social/peer relationships, particularly if he has compromised ability to regulate his emotions and there might be adverse impacts on his levels of social intelligence and empathy for others. [x] may carry a significant emotional burden over time where he feels he is to blame for being placed with [mr marella]. given [x’s] current reference for what is safe and trustworthy is [ms marella] and his maternal family members if [x] has a concept that [mr marella] is trying to cause him harm and if he forms the view that [mr marella] is not safe and trusting this will likely add to his experience of trauma. in addition, while it is speculative about how [x] will respond if he externalises his feelings, it is feasible that not only will [x] act out at school and with [mr marella] but he might try to run away either from school or [mr marella’s] home, putting at risk of physical harm.
written submissions of the applicant father  the parties separated on 1 november 2018.   [x] has not spent any time with his father since november 2018. (c) final orders were made on 16th november 2022 after a final hearing having taken each and every priority into account for [x] to spend time with the father through a process which included a process of making aware of who his father is and reintroduce him to his father. after the final hearing, the mother stated that [x] did not know who his father is or in the alternative that [x] believed that the mother’s partner was his biological father. the mother sought that there be no contact between [x] and the father. the father presents evidence that [x] does know that he is his father and as predicted by [dr h] that [x] would eventually question who his father is and why he has no contact and importantly that he will suffer loss and sadness as a result. (d) the father and the icl present evidence that the mother has relocated to queensland in defiance of the court order not to move more than 50 km from [city c]. the inference that is available to the court is that [x] has reached that point in his development when knowing his father has become important to him and this may have motivated the mother’s relocation to queensland to avoid the consequences of a healthy and meaningful relationship developing between [x] and the father.

[ms ay’s] comments that the mother was not emotionally available to [x] and she had to settle him when he was upset. in addition stating in the presence of [x] “we do not talk about his dad”. the inference available to the court is that this statement in [x’s] presence had the effect of stifling and or forbidding [x] from asking questions or inquiring about his father. this statement also flies in the face of the of the notion that [x] believes that the mother’s partner is his biological father.

(k) the mother has failed to comply with the orders on multiple occasions as set out in the father’s affidavit dated 22 november 2023. the court is required to make a determination of the child’s best interest by reference to the primary and additional factors referred to in section 60cc. it is contended that the court must balance the primary considerations of the child having a meaningful relationship with both parents and the need to protect the child from physical and psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect, or family violence.   final orders were made on 16th november 2022 after a final hearing having taken each and every priority into account for [x] to spend time with the father through a process which included a process of making aware of who his father is and reintroduce him to his father. after the final hearing, the mother stated that [x] did not know who his father is or in the alternative that [x] believed that the mother’s partner was his biological father. the mother sought that there be no contact between [x] and the father. the father presents evidence that [x] does know that he is his father and as predicted by [dr h] that [x] would eventually question who his father is and why he has no contact and importantly that he will suffer loss and sadness as a result.

it is contended by the father that the mother’s complete refusal to engage in the court process, in particular comply with orders of the court that provide for [x] to have a meaningful relationship with his father is not in the child’s best interest and amount to the child being exposed to psychological harm. the father contends that there is a risk of psychological harm to the child if he is prevented from having any contact with the father and accordingly prevented from having and developing a meaningful relationship with the father. the court has the benefit of the single expert report prepared by [dr h] dated 22 september 2020. [dr h] identifies the following:   at 1292, and assuming the current arrangements continue:
“... as he ([x]) becomes older in primary school and as an adolescent, i believe that he would start to wonder why he hasn’t been able to see his father and hasn’t been able to develop a relationship with his father and paternal grandparents. therefore, this would be a significant sad loss and confusing for [x] in the long term not to know his father.” (b) at 1296 (if the parties and a court wait until [x] is 10 years of age to reintroduce contact with the father): “... this nevertheless would be sad for [x] not to know his father for another number of years but would protect [ms marella] from the fear and stress involved with arranging contact with [mr marella].” (c) on page 2 of his report under the heading “executive summary” the following: “[mr marella] now has successfully undergone treatment and appears to be mentally well and i believe does not present an unacceptable risk to [x] or [ms marella].” “however [ms marella] has still high degrees of anxiety and fearfulness about [mr marella]. the challenge now is for [mr marella] to maintain his mental stability and for [ms marella] to overcome her fear and anxiety in order to allow [x] to gradually develop a relationship with [mr marella] whom he hasn’t seen since november 2018.” the mother and the court have had the benefit of [dr h’s] report since september 2020. despite this, the mother has embarked on a course designed to deprive [x] of having any relationship with his father. the inescapable inference is that the mother’s move to queensland can leave the court in no doubt that if the mother’s cooperation is required to act in [x’s] best interests that she will defy any order of the court no matter what it contains. in respect of the mother’s case that the father poses an unacceptable risk of harm to the child given his previous mental health-related issues, it is submitted that the court has a plethora of evidence before it that would support the father’s contention that he has been compliant with the directions of his treating medical practitioners and that the father has demonstrated his ability to effectively manage his mental health issues. the father has provided an up to date report that supports the father’s stable and uneventful mental health for some time. the mental health assessment report from the father’s psychiatrist, [dr o], filed 11 february 2020, states the following: (a) the father’s diagnosis is major depression (in remission) with partial symptoms of ptsd.   at 1296 (if the parties and a court wait until [x] is 10 years of age to reintroduce contact with the father):   on page 2 of his report under the heading “executive summary” the following:   the father’s diagnosis is major depression (in remission) with partial symptoms of ptsd.   [dr o] states that the father:
“... has progress well with the ... treatment regime ... and achieved a remission from his major depression ...”. “he has also become able to cope with his ptsd symptoms and his current mental stateis assessed to have remained stable.” “it has also been my opinion that [mr marella] has shown a good and healthy attachment to his son and he would not in any way present a danger to him if he were to be granted access to his son.” “i do not believe that [mr marella’s] tpd will have an adverse impact on his capacity to care for his child, [x]. he has been maintained on the least effective dose of medication for his condition which will not in any way interfere with his ability to care for his son.” and more recently he has reiterated a similar opinion in his report attached to the father’s affidavit dated 22 november 2023 [dr h] makes further findings that the father does not pose an unacceptable risk of harm to [x] and in respect of the management of his mental health, at line 1194, [dr h] states:
“i am not aware that he has ever presented a serious threat or danger to others,” it is also noted that the father has recommenced employment with the flexibility of working from the relevant office in [city c]. this is further evidence that the father’s mental health is stable and has been for some time. the father also relies on the affidavits of his parents, [mr ae] and [ms ab]. the father’s parents identify to the court that they are available and happy to assist [mr marella] in caring for [x’s] physical, emotional and financial needs and the court will note the father, in paragraph 78 of his affidavit, states that whilst he is currently residing in [city z] in rental accommodation: “... i reside with my parents in [city c] regularly. i intend to reside with the paternal grandparents until such time that i can obtain alternate accommodation in [city c] should [x] live with and/or spend time with me.” it is also noted that the paternal grandparents have filed undertakings with this court dated 28 june 2021. it is submitted that the court would not be satisfied that the mother has complied with the assessment of a psychologist. the considered decision of the court to date has been that [x] will benefit from a relationship with his father and reflects [dr h’s] opinion. in addition it is noted that at the time of his report [x] was 5 years old [x] is now 8 years old and in the space of young person/and soon a young adult. it is submitted that the mother has evidenced a clear intention to minimize the father’s role in [x’s] young life. in addition the mother has also evidenced a clear and willful intention to have no regard for the orders of this court. it is submitted that orders placing the child in the father’s care, noting the affidavits of the paternal grandparents and the undertakings they have previously filed with the court, will result in the child maintaining a close and loving relationship with the father whilst also protecting the child from any risk whilst the child remains in the mother’s care. it is an inescapable inference that depriving [x] the opportunity to know who he is will undermine his very identity and his ability to develop a confident sense of self without feelings of abandonment by his father. it is submitted that the court can infer that the mother will instill fear in [x] as he inquires into why he does not know his father on the basis that his father is a threat to him and the maternal family. this unhappy outcome is likely to cause [x] to lack the confidence to trust his instincts and derail his ability to develop into a confident resilient young adult. the facts that surround this outcome evidence a willful and sustained abuse of [x]. it is submitted that the mother’s belief that the father is a threat to [x] is the result of the maternal grandfather’s grief about the tragic death of his mother at the hands of his father who was an alcoholic and domestically violent. the available inference for the court is that maternal grandfather and the mother have transferred their generational grief to the father through a disproportionate emotional response to these earlier tragic events and have wrongly interpreted the father’s brief mental health difficulties as posing an ongoing treat, if it ever was a threat, to [x] and the mother. the evidence of the father sought treatment and followed the advice of his professional treating psychiatrist to the extent that he is now employed for some time will persuade the court that he has the capability, resources and the insight to manage a change of residence for [x] regardless how it is executed. true it is that the court has a difficult decision to make about the future parenting arrangements for [x] but it should not be afraid to make a decision that will serve [x’s] welfare for many years to come versus a short period of discomfort for [x]. in addition such action will have the affect of averting the psychological abuse perpetrated by the mother who acts with the confidence that the court does not have the metal to call her bluff. the father places his faith that the court will act in [x’s] best interest and take the necessary step to place [x] in his primary care relying on the evidence that he does not pose a threat to [x’s] welfare and on his undertakings that he will promote and facilitate [x’s] relationship with his maternal family as soon as it is feasible. the mother does not prosecute her case. at best she has informed the court that she has no intention of following any orders made by the court where they do not agree with her own beliefs. the father has spent significant money prosecuting his case for [x] to know and spend time with him on the basis that orders would be complied with when made in [x’s] best interests. it is submitted that the mother’s lack of engagement and her not presenting [x] to the court expert to assess how [x] may or may not react to being placed in his father’s care for a period of time until it is feasible for him to reengage with his mother and grandparents has significantly reduced the value of the latest report by the court expert. the expert has had to rely on the unknown young person and has opined in a vacuum as to how the theoretical 8 year old would react to the proposed changes to his living circumstances and has opined that the theoretical young person could experience loss and grief that may overwhelm them. this opinion is based on the belief that [x] does not know who is father is which on the father’s evidence is not the case. it also is guided by the reports of [dr h] that are now some three years old whereas [x] has advanced in his development and understanding of who he is. for instance had the expert explored this area of [x’s] understanding with him in person the expert may have come to a different conclusion. yet again the mother has willfully stymied the courts attempt to understand the issues surrounding [x’s] future welfare. it is submitted that with professional assistance the father who is a competent and responsible adult will ensure that any grief, loss or confusion experienced by [x] will be minimized. the father’s position is that as soon as it is feasible he will facilitate time with the mother and the maternal family thus further assisting [x] to adjust to his new circumstances. it is noted that the effect of returning [x] to the [city c] area is likely to be eased by his familiarity with his school, his maternal grandparents and the community with whom he is familiar. it is within the mother’s powers to return to the [city c] area to ease any loss that [x] may experience. it is likely that in the father’s care [x] will experience a minimum of psychological distress and the court can be confident that the father will facilitate any measures that [x] may suggest or request to ease any loss he may experience. it is noted that the mother by virtue of her relocation to queensland has separated [x] from his maternal grandparents whom the father acknowledges are significant attachments for [x] as are his school connections in [city c]. it is submitted that [x] is a significant, unnecessary, and unacceptable risk of psychological harm in the mother’s household as set out earlier and that this has been exacerbated by her relocation some 2000 km away which in turn extinguishes any opportunity for [x] to reconnect with his father. it is submitted that the expert’s opinion in this case is based on the obvious deficiency created by not having interviewed [x] or the mother and therefore cannot but speculate what the actual or likely effects that changing [x’s] place of residence will have on [x]. nor can she opine reliably what the effects that the mother’s relocation to queensland has and or will have on [x] in the circumstance where he is separated from his maternal grandparents and his school friends and the area that he has grown up with in addition to his awareness that he knows who his father is and what effect that the mother’s narrative that his father is dangerous will have on his development. if not now, when? once [x] has settled in queensland returning him to [city c] will have the effect of disrupting his social adhesion to his new surroundings as his connections to [city c] will necessarily diminish. the father asks the court to take this opportunity to return [x] to an environment that he is familiar with before he forms attachments in queensland that will necessarily increase the possibility of distress for [x] were the court to delay his recovery to the father’s care.

outline of principle
we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o’ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]:
the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a “meaningful relationship” with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court’s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child’s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider “the benefit to the child” of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j’s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original)
the full court also observed at [191]: “the first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression ‘meaningful relationship’ is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a ‘meaningful relationship’ ”.  7] for our part, we echo the view expressed by the trial judge of the serious nature of depriving the father of contact in circumstances where that appears to have been engineered by the mother, without any fault on the part of the father at all. this cannot be in a child's best interests. [178] it also does not appear to us to be appropriate for a parent to be able to manipulate the family law system to such an extent that the other parent's hope of ever seeing the child again, rests upon the possibility that she may wish to seek him out in later adolescence or adulthood. [179] we think that a family court would not be doing its duty if it were to simply give in to these sorts of considerations, except in the most extreme case and only then, when a positive determination is made that the welfare of the child requires it.
given the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the court must consider the conduct of the parents, not with a view to rewarding one or punishing the other, but to ascertain from such conduct whether the welfare of the child will be better served in the custody of one or the other.

affidavit of the applicant father dated 23 november 2023 (emphasis in original) i am the applicant for a recovery order in relation to the child of my relationship with [ms marella] (“[ms marella]”). 2. we were married [in] 2012. our child is [x] (“[x]”) born [...] 2015. he is 8 years of age. 4. i have no other children. 5. [ms marella] has one other child with her partner [mr as]. [ms marella] and i separated on 1 november 2018. the divorce was decreed [in early] 2020, and it became effective [in mid] 2020. our child has been living with [ms marella]. i have not seen [x] since 8 november 2018. annexed to this affidavit is a copy of a parenting order made by the federal circuit and family court of australia on 16 november 2022. x has been living with the mother and has not been spending time with me as per the orders. annexed hereto and marked with the letter “a” are a copy of the orders. i have been offered highly flexible employment opportunities at both [bf company] in [city c] nsw and [bg pty ltd] in [city z], allowing me to choose between full-time or part-time work, which ensures a stable environment for prioritising and nurturing my child's well-being under my care with adaptable work hours and locations. from my understanding, [ms marella] is engaged in [social media work], although the extent and nature of her [...] work are not entirely clear. it does display that she is in paid partnership with [a brand]. i understand she is also receiving single parenting payments despite her current relationship status. annexed hereto and marked with the letter “b” are copies of paid instagram posts. [x] has [medical equipment] that necessitates a [...] monitor next to his bed while he sleeps. this machine receives information from his [equipment] as he sleeps, and sends information to his [...] specialists. medical records indicate a history of [health conditions], resulting in prior [...] surgery, during which a [medical condition] was discovered [x] had been enrolled at [bh school] until november 2023. however, due to recent relocation to [city bb] in contravention of current orders dated 16 november 2022, i am currently unaware of the specific school [x] is attending in [city bb]. recovery order sought i have not seen [x] since 8 november 2018 as the mother and [x’s] maternal family prevented me from seeing him, disregarding orders that mandated my reintroduction into [x’s] life. moreover, on november 2023, [x] was taken to [city bb], queensland, from [city c] without my prior consent. this information was relayed to me by friends in [city c] and confirmed by [bh school], where [x] was previously enrolled. on 9 october 2023, i received a text message from [mr bj], whose daughter is in [x's] year at school. he informed me that his wife, while at work, was informed by a new client that the mother is planning to move to [city bb]. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter "c" are the text message from [mr bj]) throughout [x's] time at school, parents of children in his year have maintained contact with me due to their knowledge of him being my son. on october 11, 2023, [ms bk], whose son is best friends with [x], informed me that her son [bl] had directly asked [x] about the move, to which [x] confirmed that he was indeed moving. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter "d” for the text message from [ms bk]) on 1 november 2023, [ms bk] [...] messaged me again, this time informing me that her son [bl] received an invitation to [x's event] scheduled for november 3, 2023, indicating that after the [event], [x] would be relocating. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter "e" are text message from [ms bk]). on 2 november 2023, [ms bk] once more messaged me, revealing that [x] had mentioned to his best friend [bl] about the move to [city bb]. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter "f" for the text message from [ms bk]) on 3 november 2023, i received a screenshot from [ms bk] indicating that the mother was informing other parents at the [event] that she was moving to [region bm]. this contradicted previous information and led me to believe that she was deliberately misleading others to hide her actual location. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter "g" for the text message from [ms bk]) on 14 october 2023, i observed through local [city c] facebook pages that the mother was conducting a garage sale at [bn street, suburb bo] nsw [...], her parents' address. notably, several items, including some of my belongings that have yet to be returned to me, were put up for sale. this reinforced my concern that the information about their intended out-of-state move was accurate. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter "h" are screenshots of the facebook posts of the garage sale) on 1 november 2023, i noticed on local [city c] facebook pages that the mother's partner, [mr as], was selling a significant number of his business tools, old stock, and a [vehicle]. this further confirmed to me their intent to relocate out of state. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter "i" are screenshots of the facebook posts of the sale) on 6 november 2023, i received a text message from [ms bk], whose child is in [x's] class, indicating that the teacher informed the class about [x's] absence, stating that he is no longer enrolled at the school and has moved away. following this, i promptly emailed the principal to inquire about [x's] departure, however, the principal declined to provide any information regarding [x's] relocation. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “j” are copies of the text message and the email from the principal) on 13 november, 2023, i received correspondence from the independent children's lawyer (icl) confirming that after making inquiries with [x's] school, it was disclosed that [x] was absent from school on that day. the school authorities also informed the icl that, to their knowledge, [x] had relocated to [city bb]. on november 19, 2023, i attended [an event hosted by] my close friend, [mr bp]. the event took place in [city c], nsw. during [the event], i saw [ms bk], mother of [bl], and [ms bq], mother of [br]. [bl] and [br] are friends of [x] and all three have been classmates and have celebrated each other's birthdays over the years. while seated with [ms bk] and [ms bq] at the party, their sons, [bl] and [br], frequently returned to our table for refreshments. they were aware of my identity as [x's] father, a fact their mothers had informed them of beforehand. moreover, they had some prior knowledge of me before our encounter at the [event]. both boys inquired, 'is [x] coming to the [event]?' i replied, 'not this time,' and asked them, 'are you enjoying the [event]?' later during the party, [bl] and [br] approached me to ask about [x]. [br] asked, 'why did [x] move to [city bb]? when is he coming back?' he said, '[x's] sad he left his friends and school.'. [bl] and [br] then shared disheartening details, highlighting [x's] feelings of missing out. [br] added ‘[x's] missing out. he never got to take school photos with us, he really wanted to.' [bl] added that 'he's sad because he missed the school disco parties,' [br] continued to say '[x] didn’t come to my birthday party. he said his mum wouldn't let him go.'" i inquired with [bl] and [br] if [x] had ever mentioned me. [bl] mentioned that [x] knew about our connection because he informed [x] that his mum and i are friends. additionally, [bl] mentioned that other kids at school have talked to x about me and my efforts to see him. [br] mentioned that he informed [x] about my past association with his dad, mentioning our shared hobby of [sports]. this connection dates to the time when his father, [mr bs], and i were [sporting] companions years ago. although our paths diverged due to life commitments, we recently reestablished contact as our sons became close friends. i have sought an urgent recovery order, with police help if necessary, so that my child may be returned to my care immediately. location order as to my application for a location order, [ms marella] has been in receipt of a single parenting payment from centrelink. variation of parenting order due to the gross irresponsibility of [ms marella’s] actions, i am also seeking an order for sole parental responsibility, and an order for costs. psychiatric assessment of other party over the course of our relationship, i witnessed distressing instances where [ms marella] physically disciplined [x], including smacking him forcefully, yelling at him, and forcibly moving him to a corner by grabbing his arm. when i confronted [ms marella] about her treatment of [x], her response was, 'i had to, to keep him in line.' these actions deeply concerned me as they appeared to have a distressing impact on [x]. in moments of [ms marella’s] anger directed at [x], i observed him seeking refuge with me, attempting to hide. i want to emphasise that i never resorted to physical discipline with [x], nor did i raise my voice at him, except in situations where his safety was at risk. in fact, on a particular morning around [mid] 2018, witnessing [ms marella’s] heightened aggression towards [x], i felt compelled to take photos to document the distressing impact her behaviour had on him. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “k” are copies of the photos) i wish to draw attention to specific instances where [ms marella] exhibits significant emotional distress, often reacting vehemently, becoming hysterical, and visibly upset when my name is mentioned in the presence of [x]. these behaviours have been observed during interactions witnessed by mental health professionals. i believe these reactions stem from traumatic events within [ms marella’s] family history, notably the tragic loss of her grandmother due to familial violence. this trauma has instilled in [ms marella] a deep-seated fear, leading her to believe that a similar fate might befall her, causing extreme emotional reactions even in situations tangentially associated with perceived threats. additionally, i have been attending psychology appointments and have received an evaluation from [dr bt], my treating psychiatrist. [dr bt’s] assessment underscores my consistent dedication to maintaining mental health, adhering to prescribed medications, and active participation in therapy sessions. his report affirms my stable mental state, as evidenced during examinations and consultations. furthermore, [dr bt] emphasises my continuous concerns for [x's] well-being and asserts that i pose no harm to the child. he advocates for [x's] placement with me and my supportive family in [city c], nsw. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “l” are copied of the report) i present this information to emphasise the necessity of a comprehensive psychiatric examination for [ms marella], akin to the assessment i have undergone. this step ensures a comprehensive evaluation of both parties, prioritising [x's] best interests and welfare in these proceedings. breach of orders and non-compliance over the course of these proceedings, the mother has continually displayed a flagrant disregard for the court’s authority by breaching an inordinate number of orders. her consistent non-compliance has stymied all orders for a relationship between myself and [x] and has denied me due process in these proceedings. the mother has consistently exhibited a pattern of non-compliance with court orders, repeatedly failing to meet deadlines for filing crucial documents and disregarding court appearances. these persistent breaches encompass various orders, including late or absent filings of affidavits, failure to submit required materials, and non-attendance at court hearings. this ongoing trend of delayed or absent submissions and disregard for court appearances has persisted across multiple orders, undermining due process. the mother openly declared non-compliance with the court's orders. the mother has failed to comply with the parenting orders made on 16 november 2022. the mother breached the order restraining [x's] residence change by relocating over 2000km away. the child [x] [x] holds an incredibly special place in my heart, and my love and care for him remain unwavering. despite the challenges in our circumstances, my commitment to fostering and nurturing his relationships is steadfast. i deeply value [x's] connection with his maternal grandparents, recognising the importance of their presence in his life. i am devoted to facilitating and encouraging these relationships, ensuring [x's] continued bond with his grandparents. additionally, i understand the significance of his friendships and schooling environment. i am dedicated to maintaining his connections with friends at school, supporting his social interactions and preserving the familiar and nurturing environment he has in his educational community. [x's] happiness, well-being, and the preservation of his meaningful connections are paramount to me, and i will consistently strive to uphold these vital relationships. all the above facts are within my own knowledge except those which are deposed to from information only, my means of knowledge and sources of information for which appear in this affidavit.
appendix b
affidavit of the applicant father filed 8th november 2023 (emphasis in original) i, [mr marella] of [bu street, suburb bv], in the state of new south wales, make oath and say that: i was born [in] 1989, i am currently aged 33 years, and i am the applicant father in these proceedings [ms marella], born [...] 1991 and aged 32 years is the respondent mother (“[ms marella]”). [ms marella] and i were in a relationship that commenced in late 2008 and concluded on 1 november 2018. divorce ordered [early] 2020 which took effect [in mid] 2020. the child [ms marella] and i have one (1) child together, being [x], born [...] 2015 (“[x]”). 7. i have no other children. 8. [ms marella] has one other child with [mr as]. there has been an attempt to persuade the court that [x] believes his father to be [mr as] and that he does not know of my existence. i know that this is not the case. specific issues report on 19 october 2023, i attended an appointment in [city af] with the court child expert, [ms bc]. after my appointment with [ms bc], informed me that the mother breached another court order by declining to attend the day before, with [x]. [ms bc] informed me that she was surprised when she tried to call the mother that she actually answered the phone. the mother informed [ms bc] that she is not attending, and that this has been going on for the last five years and that the court has enough evidence already because [ms marella] “speaks directly to the judge and she feels the judge hears her” (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “a” is the specific issues report dated 30 october 2023). i am particularly concerned by the nature of this comment, in light of the fact that the mother has breached in excess of forty court orders with no repercussions. after reviewing the report on 2 november 2023, i became concerned that a number of key issues were not addressed. to my knowledge, the terms of reference were provided to [ms bc], by the icl, without the opportunity for input by either myself or my legal representatives. i brought with me evidence that the mother intends to move to [city bb] despite a court order that [x] remain living in [city c]. further, i brought up that i have sent two cards and one paternal family tree on [ms ay’s] request so she could show [x]. i told [ms bc] that people in the community have been seeing the mother, [x] and [mr as] living in [temporary accommodation]. i also told [ms bc] that i have been seeing [dr bw], who specialises in children’s mental health and will provide guidance to me if needed for [x] and that i have arranged a forensic child psychologist for [x]. i believe all of the information i provided to [ms bc] should have been considered in the report. i also made it clear to [ms bc] that i have never and am in no way running a no contact case. should [x] come into my care he would have the benefit of both parents. i know how beneficial it is for [x] to have both parents in his life and i will continue to support [x] in a close relationship with his mother, sibling and any maternal family he wishes. [ms ay’s] report since [x] has started school, i have been informed of his troubling behaviour. as proceedings have gone on, this behaviour has been getting gradually more violent. as [ms ay] reports, “it was recommended that he required higher levels of support through child psychologists” (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “b” is [ms ay’s] report dated 4 august 2023. yet neither the mother, nor the icl have done anything to get [x] these supports. it was brought to the court’s attention that the icl had been communicating with the mother without including myself or legal representation, and now i believe [ms ay] and the icl have been communicating without including myself or my legal representation in their communications. for [ms ay] to state “for [x] to have a smooth transition he will require emotional support from his maternal family without prejudice” seems to me, very contradicting and biased towards me. [ms ay] formally puts before the court that the mother is deficient at supporting [x], in particular “other barriers for [x] included – lack of communication by [ms marella], who did not offer any emotional support or truth as to why [x] needed to attend”, “any reference to the biological father would trigger [ms marella] who would become very emotional” and that “[x] needed to be removed from the room and supported by secondary staff”. furthermore, “[ms marella] would be emotionally unavailable for [x] and unable to present to support his needs” and any attempts to bring direction back to family and for [x] to participate “was threatened by [ms marella] which interrupted the therapeutic process”. tracey goes on to say “[x’s] requirement to have parents to be emotionally available to support questions, confusion and curiosity were not available”. [ms ay] lays out directly that the mother is incapable, unsupportive, not child focused and that her own staff had to console [x] because the mother could not do so (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “b” is [ms ay’s] report dated 4 august 2023). the mother claims the court had assessed her enough that she need not attend the appointment in [city af] with the court child expert, yet i note the mother has never completed a full in person assessment as ordered by the court. there have been four reports done in this matter. the mother attended a video assessment with [dr h] as noted in his report dated 22 september 2020, where she claimed strange and unproven fears. another video assessment by [ms n] as noted in her report dated 14 february 2022, who on the stand withdrew her assessment of the mother. another was ordered with [ms k] in person and a report dated 9 april 2022 was produced, but the mother refused to attend the entire assessment as noted by [ms k] “an attempt was made to undertake cognitive assessment of [ms marella] while she was in [city z] some days after the interview, however [ms marella] did not make contact for this arrangement, despite repeated communication between the icl and [ms marella’s] representative”. the only current report that assesses the mother is [ms ay’s], which suggests the mother to seek psychological care and clearly states her incapability in caring for [x’s] needs. to my knowledge the icl did not provide me or my legal representatives any input of the questions to be put to [ms ay] about her report. child forensic psychologist since there has been no progress by the mother or the icl in obtaining a psychologist for [x] as [ms ay] suggests, i have taken this matter very seriously. on 4 october 2023 i made enquires with a forensic psychologist [ms bx] from [city b], who specialises in working with children and has extensive experience and qualifications to match. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “c” are the emails to [ms bx] dated 4-17 october 2023). [ms bx] is happy to assist with helping [x] and i am willing to proceed in getting [x] to start seeing [ms bx]. i would also make myself available for any appointments the psychiatrist recommended. in order for [x] to attend, [ms bx] has made it clear that while the mother has sole parental responsibility she needs to sign the service agreement so we can all be involved. mother’s intention to move out of state on 9 october 2023 i received a text message from my friend [mr bj], who’s daughter is in [x’s] year at school, that his wife was at work and a new client informed her that the mother is moving to [city bb]. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “d” is the text message from [mr bj] dated 9 october 2023). since [x] began school, i have had parents of the children in his years make and stay in contact with me about [x], as they know that he is my son. on 11 october 2023 a mother by the name of [ms bk] whose son is best friends with [x], informed me that her son [bl] had asked [x] if he is moving and [x] stated yes he is moving. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “e” is the text message from [ms bk] dated 11 october 2023). on 1 november 2023 i received a message from [ms bk] that her son [bl] is invited to [x’s event] on 3 november 2023 as after the [event x] will be moving away. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “f” is the text message from [ms bk] dated 1 november 2023). on 2 november 2023, i received a message from [ms bk] again, that [x] told his best friend [bl] that he is moving to [city bb]. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “g” is the text message from [ms bk] dated 2 november 2023). on 3 november 2023, i received a screenshot from [ms bk] that the mother was telling the other parents at the [event] that she is moving to [region bm]. i believe the mother did not tell the parents the truth, to further hide her location. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “h” is the text message from [ms bk] dated 3 november 2023). mother’s garage sale on 14 october 2023 i noticed on our local [city c] facebook pages, that the mother was holding a garage sale at [bn street, suburb bo] nsw [...], her parents address. i noticed a number of belongings for sale, including some of my belongings which are yet to be returned to me. this further heightened my fears that the information i received that they are moving out of state was true. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “i” are the facebook posts of the garage sale, screenshotted on 14 october 2023). [mr as] business goods sale on 1 november 2023 i notice on our local [city c] facebook pages that the mother’s partner, [mr as] was selling off lots of his business tools of the trade, old stock, [a vehicle] etc. again, this to me confirms their intention to move out of state. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “j” are the facebook posts of the garage sale, screenshotted on 1 november 2023). contempt of federal court orders [in late] 2023 the local pound of [city c] nsw called my parents to inform them that my dog [...] was in the pound. [the dog] is my dog, microchipped and registered in my name. this dog was also included in my list of possessions before the court in my property matter. it was ordered that my ex return my belongings, but she is yet to give me everything on the list provided to the court, and in particular my dog. the pound called my parents on [that date] to collect my dog and so my parents collected her on my behalf, after i spoke with the pound officer. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “k” is the letter to the [city c] nsw police from jack amond, from amond legal, dated 20 october 2023, 5 july 2023 property orders, my property belongings list, and the nsw pet registry certificate of ownership). around an hour later the [city c] police called my parents that [ms marella] is at the police station with “paperwork” to show the dog belongs to her. [ms marella] knows her paperwork is misleading and in contempt of the current property orders, as the nsw pet register states [the dog] is in my name, that is why the pound contacted my parents. at no point did not the mother oppose my ownership during property proceedings. the officer threatened/intimidated my parents to return the dog, even though my parents stated that the dog is in fact my dog and i have the documents to prove it, and that i have the federal circuit court documents showing the dog is mine as it formed part of my belongings list before the court. the police threatened to charge my parents if they did not return the dog. fearful of arrest my parents took my dog back to the police station. my parents showed the officer the papers, but she refused to look at them and said “take it to court”. this behaviour by the mother to manipulate the nsw police and go against federal circuit court orders, clearly displays the mother’s disregard for court orders. i now have a legal matter against the nsw police for contempt of federal circuit court orders (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “k” is the letter to the [city c] nsw police from jack amond, from amond legal, dated 20 october 2023, 5 july 2023 property orders, my property belongings list, and the nsw pet registry certificate of ownership). supports for the mother it was ordered by the court on 16 november 2022 that “20. within 7 days of the date of these orders, the mother is to attend upon her general practitioner and provide them with a copy of the assessment completed by [ms k] dated 11 april 2022 and is to obtain a referral and mental health plan for attendance upon a clinical or forensic psychologist. this psychologist is to be nominated by the mother’s general practitioner or failing such nomination, nominated by the independent children’s lawyer” (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “l” is a copy of the orders). the mother did not provide proof of compliance with this order in its entirety. the mother wrote to the icl on 19 december 2022 stating she had attended upon her general practitioner and had a psychologist. however, the mother has failed to provide confirmation from either her general practitioner that she has attended upon them, provided them with a copy of the assessment completed by [ms k] or obtained a mental health plan. i have written to the icl asking her to address these issues with the mother and the court but she does not. (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “m” are the emails to the icl dated 21 march 2023 to 30 march 2023). it was further ordered by the court on 16 november 2022 that "21. for the purpose of order 20, the mother must (a) make an appointment with her clinical/forensic psychologist and provide the details of her psychologist to the father via his solicitor, (b) comply with the recommendations as to ongoing attendance and treatment made by the clinical/forensic psychologist, and (c) provide a copy of the following documents to the psychologist: (i) these orders, (ii) the expert report dated 22 september 2020, (iii) the family report dated 14 february 2022. (iv) the assessments of [ms marella] completed by [ms k] dated 11 april.” no evidence has been supplied that the mother has complied with these orders. the mother has provided details of a psychologist but has provided no evidence that she has made an appointment with them, complied with recommendations regarding attendance and treatment, nor provided them with the ordered reports and orders. i also note, per the ahpra website (and which i have confirmed with them via telephone), [ms by] is neither a clinical nor a forensic psychologist (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “n” is the information provided by ahpra). my solicitor has written to the icl asking her to address these issues with the mother and the court but she does not (annexed hereto and marked with the letter “o” is the email to the icl dated 10 july 2023).
