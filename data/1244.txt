and the court notes that
ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge o’shannessy
... it was clear that [the mother] was deeply committed to [x] and held her role as his protector very seriously. it was evident [the mother] remained distressed from past events and expressed distrust as to [the father’s] motives in re‑entering [x]’s life. despite this, [the mother] remained open to feedback regarding her son having a meaningful relationship with his father and stated she would be happy for this to occur, as long as [x] is safe. [the mother] reported that very gradual increases in spend time and seeing that [x] feels secure and happy would allow her to feel comfortable with spend time increasing. during the feedback meeting, [the father] again articulated his strong desire for increased spend time with his son. he reported to be open and willing to negotiate time spend arrangement and presented an idealised view of co-parenting moving forward. [the father] acknowledged his limited role in his son’s life to date and conceded that they would have to start from the beginning. this included small amounts of spend time such as a half, one or two days. [the father] had difficulty taking personal accountability for events in the past and stated ‘i did wrong, she did wrong’. he expressed the view that he wanted to ‘forget the past’ and move forward. ... pending the outcome of the visitation reports, a cautious approach in this matter is recommended. this includes time spend proceeding at a slow pace as not to overwhelm [x] and not to trigger a sudden increase in anxiety with his mother. it is likely that both [x]’s and his mother’s anxiety would be exacerbated with spend time moving to being unsupervised. while this would not prevent time spend and a meaningful relationship being established between [x] and [the father], it will be important that this is managed sensitively. [the mother] access ongoing support and counselling given the obvious distress triggered during the recent court proceedings. as [the mother’s] emotional distress is likely impacting [x], it will be important she has access to support.
... [x] indicated that he likes living with his mother and that he listens to her. [x] stated he likes attending supervised spend time with his father and commented its “good seeing dad”. when asked, [x] stated he would like to spend more time with his father. ... as [the father] entered the playroom [x] looked up from playing [video games] smiling at his father. [the father] walked up and hugged [x] who responded with a somewhat restricted hug. ... ... at the end of the observation, [the father] hugged [x] and then asked for a second hug to say ‘goodbye”. [x] responded to his father’s hug and did not necessarily reciprocate or embrace his father in the same manner. ... ... although he stated at interview that he enjoys spending time with his father, the observations indicated [x] has a superficial relationship that would benefit from spending time together in a safe environment, free from family violence, to allow the father child bond to deepen. to support the development of this relationship, [the father’s] participation in a program, such as, [g program] would assist with his understanding of the impact of family violence on his relationship with [x]. ... [x] has expressed a wish to continue spending time with his father, as per the current arrangements and possibly increase his time spent with his father. the writer is of the opinion that [x] does not have the developmental maturity to fully understand the complex dynamics of the alleged abuse, the impact of the reported inconsistent time spent to date between him and his father. hence, the writer recommends the court place limited weight on his views and consideration be given to [x]’s expressed wish to want to spend more time with his father within their developing relationship and rebuilding of trust between them. it appears [x] has begun to internalise and identify [the father] as his father, referring to him as such during interview and [the father’s] report that [x] called him “dad” for the first time during most recent supervised visit. [x]’s relationship with his father is in its early stages of development in the context of fractured caregiving experiences with both parents in early childhood and not having had contact with [the father] from age 3 years until approximately age 7 years, when supervised visits commenced. the writer did not have access to any supervisor reports. ... the challenge in this matter to finalise parenting arrangements is that [x]’s relationship with his father is at a very early and tenuous stage of development. hence, the writer respectfully suggests that it is too premature to make orders for substantial time between [the father] and [x]. ... the superficial nature of the relationship noted during observations and [x]’s desire to spend more time with his father is indicative of early relationship repair. ... recommendations based on the information gathered in this assessment, the following is recommended: [x] to continue living with [the mother]. consideration be given whether shared parental responsibility is viable ... the court may wish to consider [the mother] having sole parental responsibility to ensure timely significant decisions regarding both children’s long term care, welfare and development are made for [x] in a timely manner. that [the father] have a further eight to ten supervised visits that could occur either weekly or fortnightly, for two to three hours each visit and the final two supervised visits be of four hour duration. a supervisor’s report would assist in determining [x]’s experience of the supervised visits. spend time could then progress to unsupervised visits of four hours duration. that [the father] completes the [g program]. ... that both parents complete a parenting orders program. consideration be given to this report being made available to any professionals assisting the parties and [x].
