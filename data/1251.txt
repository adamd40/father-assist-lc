the trial
chronology of relevant events
the relationship
post-separation parenting of x
i am understanding now that whilst there was no physical violence there was a simmering emotional abuse perpetrated by me...
either take [x] and move back to [city j], or stay in [city k] and get back together with me. i don’t want you in [city k] if you’re not with me. i don’t want to be a part-time parent.
the difficulty with young children is that when a parent does not turn up for a contact visit, then the child does not blame the parent but tends to blame themself.
incident at the sports centre in early 2020
so you’re going to be a quitter and quit when it’s too hard.
x was only four years old. and this comes back to my observation about the father and his harsh, authoritarian parenting style and his lack of empathy. four (4) year olds are not quitters.
...so i can reverse the [grenville] infection –
this being a reference to the mother’s surname of [grenville]. it was disparaging. it was totally inappropriate.
i am not agreeing, because you don’t get to call the shots. this is not an argument. this is a robust conversation. you’re walking away because you’re a quitter, just like you quit the marriage.
see this? there are no court orders to stop me leaving with him. i can just walk away.
give me two minutes with my son!
do you agree that by taking [x] in this way that you were immersing him in the dispute?
to which the father responded “no”. i do not understand the father’s answer. he is an intelligent, educated man. he knows better. there is a blind spot with the father when it comes to basic insight if he cannot acknowledge that that is exactly what he did.
hi [ms grenville] that episode was horrible and cannot be repeated. i am highly emotional and frustrated with my level of contact with [x]. i have journaled dozens of requests for more snippets of care, and 95 per cent you have denied – even robbing me of easter egg fun which you got to enjoy with him – even choosing day care over me. it’s just not fair, and that is what led to yesterday’s flashpoint. i have been very patient with you, even as you have abandoned all logic and empathy for me. as [mr l]–
i am not sure who ‘mr l’ is –
said the other day, you’re unrecognisable as a person. your betrayals and lies have been, frankly, shocking. i am meeting with my lawyer on monday to begin the process of fighting for my parental rights. until there are legal consent orders you can do whatever you like in regard to withholding [x] ... and so can i. i have spoken to the police about the process. if i don’t give [x] back and you call the police, they pop in and make sure he is okay, but they do not intervene otherwise. this is problematic, as you can imagine, as trust has evaporated between us, and your track record suggests you will do whatever you want with no thought of me and what is fair. so consent orders are vital for peace of mind, yours and mine, as any breach is illegal. in the months it takes to come to agreement on a parenting plan i am appealing to you that in the meantime you do the right thing and cooperate with weekly access. i am off every wednesday, for example, but i am flexible and happy to discuss what suits you. let’s be civil, and fair and get this done.
second trial of overnight time  crying. can you talk to him?
father keeps x for longer periods than agreed
is everything okay?
at 5.30 pm:
how far off are you?
at 5.46 pm:
you’re 45 minutes late. what’s going on? is [x] okay?
it’s [x]’s bedtime, can you please drop him home.
he’s good. see you tomorrow.
can you give me an address of where you are.
oh, no, [ms grenville]. he did the same thing to me with mum. he’s not here. i am so sorry.
the co-parenting arrangements continue to be difficult
no. give [x] some time, he’s still very disturbed by the thought of you not returning him. hopefully, he comes good, and we can get back on track. it’s a shame. thought we were getting somewhere.
you really don’t get it. it’s going to be a rough year for you.
i pause here. zero empathy and a threat. the mother responds:
you just want to fight with me and to make my life miserable.
the father responds:
your choices, your life, your misery: connect the dots.
i didn’t say i was miserable. i just said you want me to be.
i lodged a police complaint about you not turning up yesterday, i will do this each time you don’t turn up.
hi [ms grenville] there is a property consent order, kid, on the family court site –
and his email goes on to talk about property. the email then goes on as follows:
regarding [x], [x]’s anxiety is very high after about two hours into the eight-hour saturday routine. he continually asks if it is 4pm yet, and he wants to go home. i have had extensive chats with [ms f]–
that is a reference to his daughter ms f –
about the 40 per cent care split experience she had, she recalls that it was stressful and not fun at all. [ms f] is now seeing a psychologist for depression/anxiety. i don’t want to make the same error with [x]. if i could grab him every now and then for a burger or take him to the beach one to two hours max, then i feel that’s the least disruptive approach, at least until he gets a few years old. happy to discuss any of the above content in person any time. regards, [mr renna].
since you’re refusing to be reasonable, care remains the same till our court date on jan 31 when you can try and defend all your lies.
the father’s anger / lashing out at the mother
nice picture of the son from the family you wrecked. thanks.
communication is appalling between us. i ask questions, seeking collaboration, and you give me a lecture, i guess that’s why we can’t agree on anything. lucky you found a [worker] of similar intellect, if that doesn’t work out, you could try a bloke from [...].
withholding him again, obviously. so evil.
at 4.08 pm the mother responded:
we are on the footpath. he was just upset, so i was calming him down.
and at 4.10 pm:
if you loop back around he is here.
not handing him over on time. another screenshot for the judge.
when the mother responded at 4.12 pm:
we were coming down the stairs as you were here –
he said:
tell the court, you evil mother.
why have you done all this? you have wrecked [x]’s life. he’s a nervous mess and always will be now. why? you flicked a faithful husband, lost $1 million house and wrecked our kid, hope it was worth it.
again, the father was focused on the relationship having broken down between he and the mother rather than on what was best for x. and, of course, once again, the mother was left to pick up the pieces. now, that is not to say that the mother should not have been at the handover on time, but these things can happen, and we are literally talking about a few minutes. the father’s reaction was completely over the top.
i need to switch to thursday 4pm [x] care till our september court appearance, are you going to obstruct this move? looks better for you in court if you pretend to be a reasonable human.
the obvious contempt that the father was demonstrating to the mother is clear enough. the mother responds:
yes. i am happy to swap wednesday 4pm to the thursday 4pm. [x] is free to start from next thursday, 31 march.
so you’re withholding my son again for the third time in seven weeks. court date is coming #burkemead#60grand -
this being a reference to the mother’s then legal representatives and to the legal costs that she was incurring.
no, i am not withholding. i have wednesday afternoon set aside for [x]’s time with you. unfortunately, this thursday doesn’t work for us, but i am happy to clear the schedule for thursdays in the future.
i was not in the unit when you messaged tonight. [x] was crying in the stairwell. although, according to my neighbour who witnessed your drop-off, my arrival to the front of the house was seconds after your drop-off/departure, it is not the point. in the event of an emergency for either parent it is in [x]’s best interests that we both sight the receiving parent on changeover. this is not the first time there have been issues with the drop-off. how about we either, meet at the front of the house, or you wait until i wave from the front balcony once i’ve received [x]. let me know what you would prefer. thanks. [ms grenville].
how about you be home at drop-off time, you neglectful parent, and maybe keep your phone on you. it will be half-care soon, so he will finally get at least some proper parenting.
once again, the father was being contemptuous towards the mother, in my view.
so last week you weren’t home for [x]’s return, and this week you’re not down here at 4pm for handover. court will sort you out.
the mother was on the footpath with x, again, she had, apparently, been running a couple of minutes late. her message to him was sent at 4.02 pm, literally two (2) minutes after the handover time. the mother said in the message:
we’re on the footpath. i was waiting for your message.
and rather than coming back to get the child, as he could well have done, the father’s response was to text the mother to say:
another step in you wrecking [x]’s life. well done. see you in court.
again, the father was ‘biting off his nose to spite his face’.
another no-show, eh?
and the mother responded at 4.04 pm:
we’re here on the footpath. [ms p]–
this being the mother’s niece –
was on the toilet –
again, instead of coming back to get the child, as he could have done, the father texted the mother to say:
i realise you’re not real bright, but you’re destroying [x] bit by bit with this crap. see you in court. another 50k to burke mead –
with a laughing-face emoji.

family report of ms d released 20 february 2023
the law
best interests
not sure why you continue to ignore me, i don’t recall us having any altercation. i note that you continue to catch-up with my ex, though –
this is a reference to the mother –
which i consider to be a massive betrayal. your lack of loyalty to your own father is disgusting. best of luck navigating life with zero integrity, looks like you and [ms grenville] are similar in that regard.
what a disgraceful thing for the father to say to his own child.
okay. first off, that’s an absolutely disgusting message to send to your daughter. just goes to show you haven’t changed. and, by the way, i am full-grown adult. i can speak to whoever i want whenever i want, i don’t need your permission. [ms grenville] was a huge part of my life and the mother of my brother, and i will always have contact. i will not stand to be talked down to like this.
and, to pause here, ms f is right: she is entitled to have a relationship with the mother if she wishes. it is not an ‘all or nothing’ situation. the world is not entirely black and white. it is, clearly, to x’s advantage to have an opportunity to see his half-sister if she wants to spend that time with him, which clearly she does. and i agree with ms f that the father was talking down to her, this is his modus operandi – his air of superiority.
yes, you are an adult. you are free to do whatever you want. you are free to be a disloyal, rude, inconsiderate human if you want, hope that works out for you. don’t bother contacting me again.
the father looked momentarily baffled, and then stated he objects in principle to her occupation and indicated he had not given her situation any further consideration. given that [ms f] is not much more than a child herself, the father’s response is devoid of care and empathy.
i agree.
they are dumb cunts who we don’t need in our lives. i told them to fuck off.
...witch of a wife.
the mother met the father’s younger sister ms u, but only saw her twice. apparently, the father did not like ms u’s parenting approach for her own children.
please start co-parenting properly with me –
as well as attaching a link to a social-media post which reads:
the biggest danger for children of divorce is when a parent refuses to co-parent.
once again, he was blaming the mother for all of the problems. this was a message that he sent her in mid-2023.
good morning. are you motivated to continue this dialogue? i am seeking a short meeting with you to discuss a potential solution. i am not sending this proposal via email as you’ll likely try and use it against me, as you have done in the past. your fee for court is 40k: mine is zero. don’t mistake my compassion for weakness. i am trying to save you that money so you can spend it on [x] and, hopefully, purchase him some housing. i am free most days. regards, [mr renna].  ’s mother is renting –
which, of course, links in with that email -
and has no partner. the constant coming and going of random short-term boyfriends is a concern as, statistically, the risk of abuse to minors in these environments is elevated.
dad says not to believe anything [ms f] says as she isn’t very bright because she didn’t finish year 10... dad said the judge is going to make me stay with him overnight... dad didn’t want to play with me. he said you’re a robber and a liar. he said that you got your brothers to help you move while dad was at work, and you left a card after stealing all his things... dad asked if i want a mum and dad or just a mum. he then said i don’t have a dad if i only spend two hours with him.
dad wants more time. he said, “maybe i may as well drop you home now because you want to live your whole life with your mum.” i told him i just want nothing to change. he wants more time with me, but he makes me not want more time, it doesn’t make any sense.
the mother asked x if ms r was home at the time of that discussion, and x replied:
she came home from the dentist, but i didn’t tell [ms r] what happened and why i was sad. i know i said i wasn’t scared of dad, but i am scared of him.
at bedtime i get these nervous thoughts at sleep time.
he worries about someone breaking in or trying to take him. it is clear enough that x needs love and support, not harshness and disciplinarianism, he needs to be kept away from the adult disputes, not put into the middle of the adult disputes. i have addressed family violence issues already, and i do not need to address those any further. i should add, though, in this respect that the father even went as far as to threaten the mother that he would be applying for an avo if the mother stayed in contact with ms f after separation. again, the father was interfering in the relationships between other people, and no such avo application was ever made.
