views of the children as expressed in the family report dated 24 january 2023
the applicant’s position in respect of the children spending time with or having involvement with the respondent
i don’t have any more strength to recall whatever happened, i don’t have any energy to deal with more stress, including him. i cannot pay attention to my children if these kinds of things keep going every now and then.... ... i won’t be able to provide the care that in good situation i can provide them, it will affect my day to day life, day to day care towards my children ... i am always triggered by the thought that he is involved directly in our life, gives me anxiety and depression.  e applicant] reports she has made her decision, and no one is going to change that. [the applicant] reports she is refusing to have 'that man' (referring to [the respondent]) in her life. [the applicant] reports if she has to attend the contact centre when [the respondent] is here, he is a big trigger for her and makes her mad and causes her stress, so she will hand the children to the police or [dcj] as he has already disrupted her life enough already and wants nothing more to do with him. the manager explained that whilst using the contact centre, she will not have to deal with [the respondent] or have anything to do with him or see him that is what the contact centre is for. [the applicant] reports she can try but she knows it will be too much and then she will give the children to [dcj] and walk away. the manager informed [the applicant] the ways in which [the contact centre] can assist with her anxiety through referrals and support her through the process but what would [the applicant] do if the children come home and say they had fun or talk about [the respondent] as they will see him. [the applicant] reports [the respondent] is a real trigger for her and makes her do crazy things that is how she ended up with an advo. [the applicant] reports she would never hurt her children but if the children want to have a relationship with [the respondent] and have contact with him or talk about him, she will give the children to police or dcj, and walk away. [the applicant] reports [the respondent] already walked away from her once and she will not give him another chance, she wants nothing to do with him. [the applicant] reports she is a good mother and does everything with her children. [the applicant] described keeping them safe, feeding them and looking after them. [the applicant] further reports if the court wants [the respondent] to be back in their lives' they can take the children from her and she will live her life stress free. ... [the applicant] expressed being stressed and not wanting to discuss [the respondent] and that he triggers her and makes her crazy like no one else can. when talking about [the respondent] it was noted that [the applicant] would refer to him as 'that man' and when the manager referred to [the respondent] as the father of the children, [the applicant] became agitated twitching in her seat stating 'don't call him that'. [the applicant] reports wishing she had never met [the respondent] and resents him for wasting a big part of her life and now she is stuck with the children and he just disappears and takes no responsibility for the children and she has no freedom. [the applicant] reports she has had to give up everything for the children, now, [the respondent] thinks he can just reappear in their lives. [the applicant] stated 'when the children needed their nappy's changed and were hungry and needed to be fed and looked after he disappeared.' now they are older and can do that themselves [the respondent] has reappeared and thinks he can be part of the children's lives. [the applicant] reports she is not going to let him do this to her and if he is going to be part of the children's lives, she is going to walk away and enjoy her own freedom and she won't let him do this. they (referring to the court) can either take the children and give them to the police or [dcj] or to [the respondent]. [the applicant] reports she has made her decision and no one is going to make her change her mind. the manager asked [the applicant] has she ever thought of hurting herself or the children and [the applicant] laughed and stated 'no i would never do that i am a strong woman i’m not crazy, but i won’t have this man in my life i will walk away from everything and live my life stress free'.
i advise the matter is temporarily deemed not suitable but will be placed on hold due to the following reasons. [the applicant] during her intake assessment stressed very strongly that she will hand the children over to the police or [dcj] if she has to have [the respondent] in her life. [the applicant] reports she is not willing to have any more stress and he is a trigger for her. ... [the applicant] reports she cannot even come to the service if he is in the same building. [the applicant] reports this would still be too much for her, but she will do what she has to do, and she has made her decision and [the contact centre] nor the court can change her mind. [the applicant] stated she is willing to try but if it’s too much which she knows it will be, she will hand the children over and then the courts and [dcj] can do with them what they want. ... [the applicant] also reports if the children were to mention his name or enjoy any time with [the respondent] she would not be able to cope with this and she would hand the children over. ... [the contact centre] therefore is deeming the matter temporarily not suitable due to emotional impact and trauma this would have on the children if [the applicant] was to relinquish their care to [dcj] for having contact with [the respondent].
oral evidence of the family report writer
one difficulty might be, and this is speculation, is that if the psychologist has made a diagnosis that was incorrect and then tries to treat for the incorrect diagnosis such as treating for ptsd and finding it resistant when it is actually not ptsd, it’s grief and loss about the distress of losing a marriage, then it might feel to the psychologist that they are not getting anywhere.
i am going to be cautious about the word trauma, if she has genuinely experienced coercive control and family violence, that would be a reasonable assertion. if she hasn’t, and it is grief and loss, it can feel traumatic, but i wouldn’t want to equate that with something like post traumatic stress disorder.  .] so, what i observed overall, ... is that [the applicant], i think she is experiencing something real to her but i think that she shows a lot stronger affect in relation to hurt and disgust than fear, in relation to [the respondent]. so, i felt like that is her almost ramping herself up. i think at some level she believes it, well i know i think she believes it, but i felt like it was to let me know ‘i'm really serious about this’, but i didn't come away from any of the assessments i've had with her with the impression that she is fearful of the father so much as disgusted and hurt. [...] so, in this matter it is possible that [the applicant] has experienced family violence and has fear but what came across to me more strongly is that she's having anxiety around the distress about the breakdown of the relationship and that is what came through in her presentation more strongly to me.  .] so, ... what happened here was she's bringing everything and the reaction appeared disproportionate to what she's talking about and i do think there was an element of which she was trying to convey to me the strength of her global feeling about him and it came out to me as somewhat false, somewhat almost revved up by her. but i think that there's a genuine experience in there for her. what i think she hasn't done is sufficiently work out which part is about grief and loss and shame in the community because within her culture you don't get divorced and which is about actual risk.
i got the impression that the things that are causing [the applicant] to feel that she could not tolerate the children having a relationship with [the respondent] are a lot more about the breakdown of the relationship and her perception that he was unsupportive than the physical violence. that doesn't mean the physical violence if it happened is not part of it. but she had a lot more strength of emotion in her tone and her body language around those issues than the actual allegations of violence.
