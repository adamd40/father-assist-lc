standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
issues for determination
issue 1: the impact of the husband’s contribution of three properties and an interest in a business at the commencement of the relationship.
issue 2: the impact of the husband’s contribution of $223,000 received by him from workers compensation payments.
issue 3: whether the husband’s income is higher than he claims and whether he had the capacity to pay the mortgage on the [bb street] properties rather than allowing the mortgage to fall into arrears of approximately $9,726.43.[45]
83. i do experience back pain on a daily basis, which at times can be debilitating. my doctor (ie. [dr xx]) has now prescribed me the following medications for my back pain: -   [1] (which l take one [...] tablet per day of a night) (b) [2] (which i take two tablets per day when required during the day) (c) [3] (which i take three [...] tablets per day. i started on these medications last month but prior to that i took [pain killers] (which are not prescribed), which i have taken for a number of years.   [2] (which i take two tablets per day when required during the day)
86. i take the prescribed medications as an anti-inflamatory and for pain relief. the tablets do make drowsy and so in the event that i secure alternate employment, i will need to factor in that i cannot drive when i am drowsy and this will dictate what employment i will be able to become involved in.
issue 4: whether the husband should be solely responsible for the outgoings relating to the properties and the company until they are sold.

property adjustment: the law
property proceedings under part viii and the approach in hickey and stanford  identify the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, liabilities, and financial resources at the time of trial, and then determine whether it is just and equitable to adjust their interests pursuant to s 79(1),[52] (2) consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)–(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[53] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[54]   consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)–(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[53] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[54]   consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[53] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[54]   ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[54]
identifying the parties' legal and equitable interests
by reference to the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, is it just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79?
section 79(4)(a)–(c) — assessment of contributions
...it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. (emphasis added) to similar effect, in cabbell & cabbell [2009] famcafc 205, the full court stated at [54] that in considering the parties' contributions, it is necessary to trace the use of those assets and consider the foundation that they laid for the subsequent accumulation of wealth by the parties. that is, in evaluating the parties' contributions, it was necessary for the primary judge to have regard to the context of the husband's initial contribution and specifically, to the opportunity that initial contribution created and the impact of that initial contribution on the subsequent wealth of the parties as at the date of the hearing. (emphasis added)
... in our opinion, in most cases, a damages verdict arising from a personal injury claim, whenever received, is a contribution by the party who suffered the injury. it should not be considered in isolation, for the reason that each and every contribution, which each of the parties makes to the relationship, must be weighed and considered at the same time.[63]

conclusion regarding the matters referred to in s 79(4)(d)–(g)
final assessment: a just and equitable exercise of discretion?
... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[104]
