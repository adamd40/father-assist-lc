application by the wife ] in mcdonald and mcdonald [1976] famca 29, (1976) flc 90-047 at 75,201, the full court identified the distinction between “those parts of an order which determine and vest property rights and those which provide for the machinery to carry out the order effectively”. the full court added:
in our view, there is ample power to modify the machinery provisions of a property order provided this does not affect the substantive property rights or cause undue hardship to either party. ] the full court returned to these issues in ravasini and ravasini [1982] famca 62, (1983) flc 91-312. the court said at 78,126:
there is no question of the power of the court to make what we would with respect suggest is more properly called a consequential order. the real questions are what is the proper definition of a consequential or machinery order and where is the dividing line between a consequential order which may be varied or modified and a substantive order which the act gives no power to the court to modify or vary. ] at 78,127, the court said:
in determining whether or not an order may be varied as a machinery order, the enquiry must be firstly as to what part of the order is the substantive order and what part or parts of it merely follow that order as a necessary consequence. a court in making a property order might do no more than order that the property be sold and the proceeds equally divided. that is the substantive order. if the court at that time has before it sufficient evidence of the facts and circumstances it may go on and make appropriate “consequential” orders providing the machinery whereby the substantive order is to be carried out.   she is 60 years of age, and the husband is 88 years of age, (b) the parties met in 2002, were married in 2003, and there is one adult child of the relationship, (c) in 2008, the
