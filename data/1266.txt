reasons for judgment
judge betts
overview
...should the court find that the father is an unacceptable risk.
this is the most draconian application the mother could possibly make, which dovetails very neatly with her proposal that the father spend no time with y. at the hearing, the mother abandoned her ‘risk case’, although she still maintained that the father posed problems for her and that x’s best interests would still be better served by her being able to relocate to sydney.
the hearing
chronology of events
the father
the mother
the relationship
he’s not your dad. he’s a cunt. he doesn’t belong here.
following one such argument, y stopped calling the father “daddy [mr bilson]”.
post-separation
...perhaps having a one-night stand with him just to piss you off.
she also said in a text message that she:
...should take a photo of my fanny or naked photo then send it to him to see what he thinks next.
from now, if you want to spend time with your son, i can meet you up at the park for a couple of hours. you don't need to come to my house. i’ll meet up somewhere. if you can’t make any agreement with me, then bring me to court if you want. full stop from now. if you don’t wake up to yourself, then i’ll block you. stop hassling me with all your bullshit messages.
this was the mother's response to the father's regular messages to her wanting to see x.
these proceedings
1st child inclusive conference
drug and alcohol testing, mental health challenges
just wanting to check up on [x]’s health and wellbeing and make sure there have not been any more instances when he has “stopped breathing”.
...understanding that he must be smarter and not let his frustration undermine his behaviour.
changes to the time – it becomes unsupervised
covid-19
what the mother told the day care centre  bilson] tried to get fifty-fifty access of [y]. he abused [y]the day [x] was born. [mr bilson] had [y] at home, and he said he urinated on her head.
more conflict
the father’s time with x significantly increases
...probably more than i would have agreed to if covid did not occur.
that is to say, the mother agreed to the extension of time, but it is quite clear that she was somewhat reluctant and that such increase would not have happened but for covid. 1st family report
1st family report
father ‘pushes the envelope’
further dcj investigation
father begins filing covid applications
ndis
2nd child inclusive conference
the litigious path continues, another avo is taken out  often shows regression in both expressive and receptive communication during times of transition from his father’s to his mother’s care. this has been evident since i commenced working with [x].
2nd family report
christmas day 2022
last covid application, father’s ‘tit-for-tat’ behaviour
events in the leadup to the final hearing
...then biting his right hand, then had asked me what finger he bit of mine. i then showed her, and she bit his right index finger. she then told us to just smack him.
i will bite you when we are home, [x].
the law
the reality is that maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents: obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have been incurred.
the mother also reports that [x] has returned with a very sore penis every monday since [late] 2022 after returning from spending time with the father, which has led to her taking [x] to the hospital more than three times. she reports [x] to have discharged pink urine on occasions too, which medical examinations to date have not been able to diagnose. the mother reports having videorecorded [x] during one hospital presentation to evidence [x]’s crying and level of pain in case she was ever questioned about this. when asked directly if she’s insinuating that the father may have sexually harmed [x], the mother expressed that she’s not accusing the father but just wonders why [x] presents in this way on returning from spending time with the father.
there are many examples of the father’s problematic style of communication in independent material from various sources, including threatening, intimidating, disrespectful, insistent and self-righteous behaviour and ways of communicating that raised concerns for others.
you [people] make up your own rules. you don't know what you're talking about. i want to speak to someone who knows what they're talking about.
it was disrespectful and rude.
you obviously don't know the law.
he suggested the paediatrician contact a lawyer.
have you had another meeting with the mother that i have to subpoena info for, or can we just be up-front?
however, under no circumstances will threats of defamation, insults or other negative behaviour be tolerated towards our staff. we understand the emotional side of parenting. however, as an independent company, we withhold the right to decline service to individuals who don’t treat our staff with respect.
