dr f’s report
in addition to the above, [ms cygnis] stated that [mr cygnis] has expressed delusional thought content over the years in relation to: [australian politics], trade unions, police, and the lgbtqia community. ... with respect to [mr cygnis’] alleged acts of aggression during the marriage, [ms cygnis] referred to: verbal tirades, throwing objects, slamming things, pushing past [ms cygnis], driving erratically and aggressively, making threats to others online, writing threatening and abusive letters to government officials, suggesting that he has a ‘right’ to ‘execute’ others. ... in addition to the aforementioned alleged physical aggression, [ms cygnis] also claimed that [mr cygnis] was sexually abusive towards her throughout the union. she described [mr cygnis] being ‘fixated’ on having sex with her at specific times and if [ms cygnis] was resistant to this, she claimed that he would force himself on her sexually. this included forcibly restraining [ms cygnis] at times and [ms cygnis] stated that she was often tearful and visibly upset during such encounters, which would apparently go ignored by her husband. [ms cygnis] identified that [mr cygnis] raped her many times during their relationship and whenever she raised this with [mr cygnis], he would apparently refer to his ‘right’ to have sex with her whenever he wanted as they were married. ... [ms cygnis] explained that her relationship with [mr cygnis] deteriorated during late 2018, which she believes was associated with a worsening of his mental health. the “final straw” for [ms cygnis] came when she opened a letter outlining a substantial and long-standing tax debt. [ms cygnis] apparently confronted [mr cygnis] about this, who explained that he was the victim of a government conspiracy, in addition to allegedly blaming [ms cygnis] for the debt. it was at this point that [ms cygnis] decided to end the union. ... according to [ms cygnis], [mr cygnis] does not participate actively in any responsibilities as a parent. for example, she reportedly communicates with him after every medical appointment but he does not respond, nor does [mr cygnis] attend parent-teacher meetings or engage with the school via the app on which she has encouraged him to register. [mr cygnis] also apparently refused to contribute financially, although he apparently does so now but otherwise, [ms cygnis] claimed that [mr cygnis] leaves all the responsibilities of parenting to her. ... [ms cygnis] identified that [mr cygnis’]relationship with the children is very important and she claimed that this is the primary motivation in her continued family court application, which she believes is in the children’s best interests. as such, [ms cygnis] stated that she will ‘fully support’ [mr cygnis’] relationship with the children and to this end, she claimed to ‘cover’ for [mr cygnis] with the children, she reportedly encourages his involvement with [x] and [y], in addition to supporting the paternal family’s involvement with the children. to this end, [ms cygnis] stated that ‘they are not my children, they are our children, they love him and want a relationship with him and i will support this’. however, [ms cygnis] added that this relationship needs to be safe for the children, in addition to which she does not want any relationship with [mr cygnis] to have an adverse influence on the children’s mental health. [ms cygnis] commented that the children are ‘too little to have to manage their dad’s mental health by themselves’. ... [ms cygnis] told me that she had prepared the children for the assessment with me by telling them that i am someone who helps in ‘tricky family situations’. she had apparently researched me online and showed the children what she found, including my photo and discussing my professional biography with them. in addition, [ms cygnis] stated that she told the children just to answer any questions i asked of them. further, [ms cygnis] stated that she does not talk to the children much about the situation with their father. however, she claimed to have told the children that [mr cygnis] ‘is not making safe, kind choices’ and so the children need other adults in their lives to help keep them safe. [ms cygnis] stated that a family violence order remains in force protecting her from [mr cygnis] and this apparently expires in [early] 2022. [ms cygnis] claimed that [mr cygnis] has not been involved in any ‘major breaches’ of this order but she did report a number of instances of what she conceptualised as more minor breaches. for example, she claimed that [mr cygnis] has tried to speak to her by telephone before or he has approached her car. [ms cygnis] commented that when [mr cygnis] is in ‘an emotive state’, he cannot seem to remember the conditions of the family violence order, nor does he consider his actions to any great extent or the consequences of his behaviour for himself or others. ... interpersonally, [mr cygnis’] responses to the test items of the pai suggest that she is other-focussed to an extent that she may be considered naïve or gullible. to this end, [ms cygnis] seems to have a strong need to be liked by others and this will make it difficult for her to be assertive or display anger in relationships, for fear of rejection. as such, [ms cygnis] may tend to be dependent in her close connections with others, as well as being prone to being easily taken advantage of. further to this, [ms cygnis] endorsed having a large and supportive network of people in her life, which is a positive prognostic indicator. ... [mr cygnis’] manner was somewhat odd and i note that his account was highly detailed in some areas, whilst [mr cygnis] seemingly struggled to respond to questions in other areas (for example relationships). i formed the view that this is consistent with his asd diagnosis, which will be discussed further below. it is also noted that in responding to questions, [mr cygnis] appeared to take repeated opportunities to malign [ms cygnis]. overall, his account was confusing and contradictory and [mr cygnis] often did not answer the question asked of him or he needed repeated prompting to do so. ... when asked to describe himself socially, [mr cygnis] offered that he is ‘more intro/extro’, by which he explained that he can be shy and have difficulties relating to others socially but with people he knows well or with family members, he is comfortable and can be quite extraverted. [mr cygnis] stated that he does have friends in his life and he stated that some of these relationships have persisted over the long term. however, [mr cygnis] also claimed that friends have moved in and out of his life depending on his circumstances as well. after marrying [ms cygnis], [mr cygnis] stated that he invested more in the couple’s mutual friendships. however, he claimed that none of these people has contacted him since the separation. consequently, [mr cygnis] described feeling somewhat lonely and isolated at the present time, even though he claimed to be used to having to make new friendships, in addition to stating that there are people in his life on whom he is able to rely for support. ... with respect to the symptoms of adhd that [mr cygnis] has experienced, he identified the following: difficulties with cognitive organisation, poor concentration. [mr cygnis] denied any of the other hallmark symptoms of this condition, such as hyperactivity and restlessness. comment: this would suggest to me that attention deficit disorder, inattentive type is a more likely diagnosis than adhd. in terms of asd symptomatology, [mr cygnis] told me that he tends to ‘hyperfocus’, which he explained means he can become fixated or obsessively focused on something he is interested in to the extent that he will be ‘oblivious to everything else’. [mr cygnis] stated that he can focus on something for hours, during which time, he can lose track of time generally, in addition to which [mr cygnis] offered that he can become irritated if others distract him or disconnect his focus. [mr cygnis] was unsure of any other symptoms of asd that he has suffered but on specific questioning, he reported to struggle at times to understand social cues. further to this, [mr cygnis] described being an ‘odd person’, who has always felt different to others and whose mannerisms are ‘not normal’. moreover, he claimed to have difficulties maintaining eye contact and responding in communication in a timely manner. he does however, feel confident in being able to read others’ emotions. ... [mr cygnis] denied a history of auditory hallucinations per se but he did report occasions when he can hear a high pitched tone. [mr cygnis] struggles to identify whether this tone is real apparently and will, at times, check alarms or other such devices to ensure they are not emitting the sound. [mr cygnis] also described being overly sensitive to electrical currents, which he claimed he read in a book is a ‘fairly common’ sign of asd. comment: i have not heard this before and although this may be something he has read, it is important to note that such phenomena are not diagnostic or included in the diagnostic nomenclature related to asd. with respect to other possible symptoms of psychosis or thought disorder, [mr cygnis] denied any history of magical thinking, derealisation, depersonalisation or ideas of reference. he also denied any experience of delusional thinking however, when questioned more specifically, [mr cygnis] stated that he does have some firm views, although he does not believe that these are ‘extreme’ and rather, that [ms cygnis] has ‘extrapolated things’ and ‘made it 100 times worse’. [mr cygnis] stated that he is ‘entitled to hold views and discuss them’. he claimed that he is ‘entitled’ to be opposed to same sex marriage but [mr cygnis] denied ever making threats to kill anyone or to suggest that homosexuals would infiltrate schools and abuse students. [mr cygnis] acknowledged being in possession of an old [weapon], which was allegedly his father’s originally and he claimed to carry this as ‘a symbol of working hard’ as a connection with his family values. when asked about his engagement with social media, [mr cygnis] normalised this and suggested that his behaviour online is the ‘same as everyone else’. he acknowledged being banned from [social media] before but claimed that most people have. [mr cygnis] stated that the people he was engaged in a debate with online who disagreed with his views, ‘kept flagging’ him so an ‘automated algorithm’ banned him. [mr cygnis] claimed that [news] is as important to him as it is to anyone however, he has no interest engaging actively on a [harmful] level apparently. [mr cygnis] denied ever making comments that it would appropriate to kill someone however, he did acknowledge questioning the leadership at the time of an election, as a result of which [mr cygnis] claimed to have been targeted with death threats online. he also made comment about being targeted by a ‘[government] movement’ as a result of his views, in addition to suggesting that [ms cygnis] had been ‘counselled’ by people in her workplace by ‘people that way slanted’ to ‘attack’ him. with respect to any evidence [ms cygnis] had for these claims, he made reference to his [social medial] settings being reset without his knowledge and his account also being hacked by others. [ms cygnis] also claimed that threats made towards him by others online were subsequently deleted so he had no capacity to make a complaint or take any action. in response to specific questioning, [mr cygnis] also acknowledged that he can rant and rave for hours about something but he denied that this is ever with any malintent or aggression. rather, [mr cygnis] attributed this to the hyperfocus that considers characteristic of his asd. ... in addition to his treatment with [mr k], [mr cygnis] offered that he has been assessed by psychiatrists, [dr e] and [dr l]. [mr cygnis] claimed that these assessments were motivated by the fact that both his general practitioner and [mr k] allegedly expressed concerns that [ms cygnis] would ‘use these allegations to get at’ him in family court and therefore, his case would be bolstered by seeing a psychiatrist and not just a psychologist. [mr cygnis] told me that he had one session with [dr l], which was ‘great’ but [dr l] did not offer any diagnosis for him. [mr cygnis] then saw [dr e] and he stated that this occurred after [ms cygnis] ‘tried to destroy ([mr k]’s) reputation’ because he did not agree with her and [mr cygnis] believes that [ms cygnis] wanted him medicated. [mr cygnis] added that he believes [ms cygnis] ‘wants (him) in the least capable position to look after the kids’. [mr cygnis] understands that [dr e] agreed with [mr k]’s assessment of him but suggested the level of asd severity should be lessened. ... [mr cygnis] demonstrated a sound understanding of the role and responsibilities of parenthood, including demonstrating insight into the range of needs that children present with. like his parents, [mr cygnis] acknowledged that he has used mild corporal punishment as discipline, although he apparently only did so with [x], as [y] was ‘too young’ at the time he was living in the family unit. [mr cygnis] stated that he needed to smack [x] on only a small number of occasions because both children ‘adored’ him and therefore, his ‘disapproval’ tended to be enough to intervene in any misbehaviour. in response to specific questioning, [mr cygnis] also told me that there is no specific religious framework for the use of corporal punishment. he stated that the bible indicates that parents should smack their children but that this should be done ‘in a loving manner’. ... position in relation to the current court matter - according to [mr cygnis], the family court did not become involved until about 18 months after the union between the parties ended. [mr cygnis] claimed that prior to this, [ms cygnis] controlled the time he spent with the children and she was apparently inconsistent in her expectations of him in achieving this. she also denied him extra time with the children when he asked for this. [mr cygnis] also claimed that [ms cygnis] took his entire salary during this period and would only allow him $80 per week for living expenses. even so, [mr cygnis] stated that he never sought legal advice, although he did apparently try to initiate counselling/mediation with [ms cygnis] but she reportedly refused to participate. ... [mr cygnis] acknowledged that about 18 months ago, the court granted him four hour blocks of time with the children but he only takes two hours. [mr cygnis] then told me that [ms cygnis] has lied to the children’s school about the court orders, as well as actively attempting to ‘separate’ him from anyone who ‘could stand up for (his) side’. [mr cygnis] also reported that the court ordered that his time with the children be supervised. he claimed to have been unaware that he was being supervised before this. comment: i find this unlikely as one of his sisters was reportedly present at every visit that occurred at his parents’ house. [mr cygnis] added that [ms cygnis] made the situation so ‘awful’ for his sisters that they refused to be present for any more visits, which forced the need for professional supervision. comment: [ms cygnis’] account suggested that [mr cygnis’] sisters had to discontinue supervision due to their own personal commitments and routine. [mr cygnis] then told me that he does not take the full entitlement of his time with the children because [b contact centre] cannot facilitate the necessary hours and he cannot afford to pay for additional supervision time with another service. [mr cygnis] referred to this a ‘horrible abuse financially’ by [ms cygnis]. ... ideally, [mr cygnis] reported that he would like ‘fair access’ to the children that is ‘not controlled’ in any way by [ms cygnis]. he claimed that it is ‘disgusting’ the way he is being treated. [mr cygnis] added that he would like ‘the most time possible’ and in as natural a manner a possible, which includes having no supervision. [mr cygnis] then stated that he would like a shared care arrangement, even though he claimed that this would not be feasible given he works on a full time basis and therefore, could not manage to be flexible enough to cope with the children’s routine, such as attending school pick ups. ... i also asked [mr cygnis] about [ms cygnis’] allegations of sexual abuse at his hands during their marriage. [mr cygnis] told me that [ms cygnis] has completely fabricated these claims and that doing this is a ‘normal allegation for women to make in family court because it forces the game to be against the man’, which he stated is ‘part of the feminists’. ... when i asked [x] to describe his mother, he told that he dislikes when people yell and he ‘appreciate(s)’ that his mother does not yell much. in addition to being ‘nice’, [x] also commented that his mother ‘handles’ his sister well when [y] is in a bad mood. [x] stated that there is nothing he dislikes about his mother. with respect to his comment about disliking people yelling, [x] offered that when [mr cygnis] used to live with the family, he remembers hearing his father yell of a nighttime, which ‘freaked (him) out’. [x] also commented that he felt ‘threatened’ by his father’s yelling sometimes. in particular, [x] recalled two salient incidents. he reported that on one occasion, he was sitting at the dinner table, when [mr cygnis] was ‘getting bad’ and his father allegedly ‘threatened to hurt’ [x] with an [object]. [x] said he was a year 1 student at the time and he felt ‘very scared’. [x] did not want to discuss the other incident in his memory with me. comment: i do not know why [x] was unwilling to discuss this incident with me and i do not know the incident he was referring to. ... [x] reported that [mr cygnis] does not live with the family anymore, which he claimed is because his father was ‘not safe’ and suffers with a ‘mental illness’. [x] commented that it is a good thing that [mr cygnis] is not living with the family anymore because he is now ‘safe’ and no longer has to feel ‘scared’ but he conceded that he does miss his father. [x] told me that he spends two hours with [mr cygnis] each fortnight but he also claimed that at times, this period is shorter because his father is late. [x] told me that he did feel unsafe living with his father at times, although there were also fun times apparently. in terms of when things felt unsafe for [x], he referred to his father ‘shouting and screaming at us’ and ‘threatening to do stuff’. however, [x] also noted that [mr cygnis] often worked long hours and therefore, he did not see him too often. as such, [x] claimed that [ms cygnis] was the parent who was most available and most involved with the children and their routines and care needs. [x] stated that his father is ‘never scary’ when he visits with him at [b contact centre] and he does not know why this is. however, [x] told me that the visits are ‘perfect’ and he suggested that perhaps this is because [mr cygnis] is aware that he is being supervised and therefore, ‘wants to be good’. [x] added that he very much likes to visit with his father and in particular, he likes to play games with [mr cygnis]. x also reflected that he does not get to see his father often and he would like to see him more if possible. specifically, [x] identified that he would like to see his father on a weekly basis for perhaps three to four hours. [x] also noted that he would like to see his father’s house and spend time there, perhaps on an overnight basis. [x] reported that he and his father share similar interests, like building [games] and playing online games. he also likes that his father knows how to play games he likes. with respect to anything he dislikes about his father, [x] referred to [mr cygnis] being unsafe previously. further, [x] commented that he has ‘some trauma stuff’, which he blames his father for. for example, [x] again commented that he does not like being around yelling, which makes him feel afraid. he described feeling physiological and cognitive symptoms of anxiety at these times, which [x] stated are ‘annoying’. he told me that he talks to his psychologist about this, which he finds helpful. [x] summarised in stating that he would like to remain living with his mother but he would like to see his father more often. ... [y] described how [mr cygnis] likes ‘gaming’, in addition to which he likes to play with the children, as well as knowing what they did at school. [y] told me that she made something for her father for father’s day and he liked it. she also spoke about how [mr cygnis] plays with her when he spends time with the children at [b contact centre]. [y] does not dislike anything about her father apparently. [y] stated that [mr cygnis] does not live with them as a family unit because he ‘has mental health and is not being safe’. she added that [mr cygnis] now has his own house to live in, which she commented is ‘good’. she claimed that she would like to see her father’s house but [y] is unsure whether she would want to stay in this house. i asked [y] what she meant about her father not being safe and she explained that she is the ‘second born so i don’t remember much but he would say i’ll smack your bottom until it’s blue or red or whatever’. ... [y] told me that her mother informed her that [mr cygnis] ‘blamed everything on mummy’ and she is also aware that [x] becomes upset sometimes because he remembers more than she does about their father. as such, [y] described how [x] ‘gets into pieces and we have to put the pieces back together so he’s fine’. [y] added that her mother knows how to put [x]’s pieces back together. ... in response to other allegations made by [ms cygnis] in relation to his expressed beliefs, in the aforementioned affidavit, [mr cygnis] offers the following:
i do have strong political and religious beliefs which i have in the past expressed to other people i work with and on social media. unfortunately, i concede that i have entered into debates that have led to arguments where i have become emotional about it and angry. following my diagnosis of autism and adhd relatively late in life ... i appreciate that i possibly became entrenched in arguments as a result of my condition. if i understood my mental diagnosis and potential triggers i would have been able to avoid situations on social media. counselling every week and month has helped me to identified (sic) situations were (sic) my autism and adhd may be triggered are (sic) where i can take appropriate steps to remove myself from a situation and clam myself through deep breathing and other techniques provided by counselling.
comment: this is not reflected in [mr k]’s report as outlined above. ... opinion/summary: [mr cygnis] and [ms cygnis] were involved in a relationship that spanned over a decade and resulted in the birth of two children, now aged six and ten years. the relationship between the parties broke down during 2019 and the children have remained in the care of their mother, whilst they have supervised and weekly contact with their father. it seems there is little doubt that [ms cygnis] has been the children’s primary caregiver and attachment figure throughout their lives. [ms cygnis] has applied to the court in order to protect the children from risk she perceives their father poses to them on the basis of his uncontrolled and as yet inadequately diagnosed mental health condition and she is seeking to have the primary residence remain with her, with sole parental responsibility. [mr cygnis] makes counter-allegations about [ms cygnis’] ill mental health and abusive behaviour and although he ideally would like shared care of the children, he claims that this is not realistic for him and therefore, he would like to spend as much time with the children as possible, whilst sharing the parenting responsibility with his ex-wife. the accounts of the relationship between the parties differs between mr. and [ms cygnis]. [ms cygnis] reported that she had concerns about [mr cygnis’] mental health and behaviour from early into their dating relationship and that these concerns worsened over time to the extent that she ultimately made the decision to leave the marriage. [ms cygnis] claimed that [mr cygnis] was physically, verbally, psychologically and sexually abusive to her throughout the marriage, which she contextualised as a function of his mental health concerns. [mr cygnis] suggested that whilst [ms cygnis] was a loving wife and their relationship was happy, [ms cygnis] was also physically, psychologically and verbally abusive towards him during the relationship and after the union ended, as well as being deceitful, manipulative and duplicitous. many of the parties’ claims are in fact almost identical but seek to place blame with the other for the abusive behaviour. there is now no workable relationship or effective communication between the parties and although [ms cygnis’] account was rather balanced and ultimately, supportive of [mr cygnis], [ms cygnis’] account was suggestive of a high level of anger and resentment towards [ms cygnis]. [ms cygnis] reported to have had a reasonably stable upbringing, although the relationship between her parents did not continue and she was exposed to some domestic violence between her mother and stepfather. even so, she reported to have made the developmental transition with relative ease and she continues to enjoy the support of her family today. she was apparently a well-adjusted child and student, who achieved well at school and went on to tertiary study. [ms cygnis] has established a stable career [as a professional] and it is apparent that she has maintained independence, has participated productively in the community and is reportedly well supported by prosocial peers. further to this, [ms cygnis] does not have a history of antisociality or substance abuse and despite some adjustment related emotional distress at times in her life associated with significant life stressors, she denied any notable mental health concerns or functional disturbance at any time. [mr cygnis] also reported to have come from a stable and supportive family unit where he was not exposed to any abuse or neglect and his developmental needs were well catered for. [mr cygnis] was reportedly an intelligent child, who demonstrated some affective dysregulation as a child and who began to struggle more cognitively as he moved into adolescence. specifically, [mr cygnis] reported to have struggled academically, with poor organisation and attention to detail and this continued into university, with [mr cygnis] ultimately failing his degree. even so, [mr cygnis] has established a stable career [as a professional] and he has maintained gainful employment and productive living, although i note that there is a history of workplace difficulties for him, with [mr cygnis] claiming to have been bullied, harassed and treated unfairly by others. there is also no history of criminality or substance abuse for [mr cygnis] but his mental health is of concern. as noted, [ms cygnis] reported to have had concerns about [ms cygnis’] mental health for years. she observed his rigid thinking and obsessive focus and over time, suggested that [ms cygnis’] thinking became obsessional, fixed, bizarre and likely delusional. according to [ms cygnis], these concerns impacted on [mr cygnis’] behaviour, such that he was unavailable at times to his family, he was aggressive, he would rant and rave for hours, he would make threats to others, including his family, he would have difficulties in the workplace and he engaged with social media online in an obsessive and unhealthy manner. there is some support for her claims given the account of [mr cygnis’] sister, the documentation provided to me from his previous employer and the reports of [mr cygnis] being banned from [social media]. i also note [x]’s account of [mr cygnis] yelling and being aggressive, including threatening him with [an object] allegedly on one occasion. some years after his general practitioner also expressed concerns about [mr cygnis’] mental health, he consulted with clinical psychologist [mr k], who subsequently diagnosed [mr cygnis] with adhd and asd and these diagnoses have been since supported by psychiatrist, [dr e]. [mr cygnis] believes these diagnoses are apt and help explain his functioning. however, it is noted that the only real symptom of adhd that [mr cygnis] complains of is poor cognitive organisation, whilst the primary asd related concern is of rigid, obsessional hyperfocus. [mr cygnis] did report some mild challenges socially as well however, he did not endorse any of the other hallmark symptoms of either adhd or asd. i also note that if [mr cygnis] suffers from adhd, he would likely have experienced difficulties academically from early on in school and it is unusual he did not report this, although it may have been that once the work became more complex in secondary school, he started to struggle more. it seems evident that cognitively, [mr cygnis] is prone to hyperfocus and to poor organisation and whilst there is an apparent history of affective and behavioural dysregulation, as well as some impulsivity dating back to early childhood, i am not convinced that [mr cygnis] suffers with either adhd or asd. certainly, if he does have an attention deficit condition, i would suggest that this is of the inattentive type rather being related to hyperactivity, which is the more classic presentaton. further, if asd is an accurate diagnosis, i agree with the opinion of [dr e] that considers [mr cygnis’] condition to be mild, without serious functional impairment. [ms cygnis] expressed concerns about possible delusional thought patterns for [mr cygnis], which he denies. however, he did report holding some fixed views, in addition to which some of the comments he made to me at interview could also suggest possible delusional or paranoid ideation (for example, [ms cygnis’] claim that [ms cygnis] may have been manipulated by a group in government to end their marriage and treat him poorly). further, [mr cygnis] did endorse some auditory hallucinations and if the examples of his social media posts contained in affidavits are accurate, then he has expressed views in the past that are concerning and suggest possible delusions. in addition to the above, with specific questioning at interview, [mr cygnis] endorsed experiencing some likely manic or hypomanic symptoms at times. i am unclear from the reports of [dr e] and [mr k] whether possible manic episodes were explored with [mr cygnis] on assessment. taking into account the information available to me, i propose the differential diagnosis of [a mental illness] for [mr cygnis]. this condition is characterised by alternating periods of mood disturbance and disordered thinking. it is unclear what is an accurate diagnosis for [mr cygnis] but i am doubtful about adhd and asd being appropriate, although [mr cygnis] does present with some features of these conditions. i am concerned however, that the behavioural and affective dysregulation and the concerning patterns in [mr cygnis’] thinking, in relation to which he seems to have little capacity for insight or self-management, represent another condition. i also note that there are indicia in this case of personality disordered traits for [mr cygnis], which include difficulties interpersonally, distorted beliefs about others and a tendency to dysregulation and impulsivity. however, these would not be of sufficient severity to warrant formal diagnosis in my opinion, although add to an understanding of the clinical picture. whatever the precise diagnosis for [mr cygnis] is, it is clear that he is someone who has been odd and had difficulties since early in life. these have caused him problems in relationships and in the workplace and of more relevance to the present matter, have also resulted in alleged aggressive, dysregulated and threatening behaviour. [mr cygnis] denies these claims but it seems that in addition to [ms cygnis’] account, there is some other evidence that lends weight to the claims that [mr cygnis] does have a history of concerning and seemingly aggressive/abusive/dysregulated behaviour. the primary issues in this case pertain to the allegations of a) mental health concerns for both mr. and [ms cygnis], b) aggressive and abusive behaviour by both parties and c) [ms cygnis’] reported efforts to alienate the children from their father and exclude [mr cygnis] having any responsibility or active involvement in the children’s lives. with respect to the former, for the reasons outlined above, i am of the opinion that [mr cygnis] suffers with a mental health condition, the precise nature of which is unclear but i favour [a mental health condition] with some traits associated with personality disorder, as well as neurocognitive difficulties. these concerns are enduring and have been present since early in life and have caused [mr cygnis] difficulties in various domains of functioning, both internal and external to the family. i note that he is not treated with any psychotropic medications, which i also find somewhat unusual given the diagnosis of adhd with ongoing cognitive disorganisation. further, [mr cygnis] has been engaged in a treatment programme with his psychologist for some years and although he describes this positively, in my view, the reported treatment plan does not align well with the diagnoses made by [mr k]. rather, [mr k] outlines a programme of general psychological support, including a focus on self-regulation skills, psychological flexibility and cognitive challenging, which will be beneficial for [mr cygnis] but do not specifically address the symptomatic concerns common in either adhd or asd. despite the aforementioned intervention, [mr cygnis’] views remain fixed and rigid and his opinion about [ms cygnis] and her behaviour is angry and resentful and i note that [dr e] expressed concern about this in his report of some years ago. to this end, it does not appear that psychological treatment with [mr k] has brought about substantial change in thinking, although it does seem that [mr cygnis’] capacity for affective self-regulation has improved. even so, i note that he is no longer living in the stressful environment of a difficult marriage and the responsibilities of parenting so it remains unclear whether [mr cygnis] would again be prone to affective and behavioural dysregulation under conditions of stress, which i suspect will likely be the case given his past functioning. [mr cygnis] alleges that [ms cygnis] suffers from ill mental health, citing prior postnatal depression following the trauma of [x]’s birth, in addition to a [mental health] condition. [ms cygnis] denied a history of serious mental health concerns, although she did endorse some situational related anxiety and low mood associated with significant life stressors and in relation to which she appears to have acted proactively through seeking psychological support. it is my assessment that there is no clear evidence that [mr cygnis’] account of [ms cygnis’] mental health is accurate. there is no documentation to support this, the children describe their mother as kind and well-regulated and [ms cygnis’] functioning in other domains outside of the marriage supports the picture of someone who is well-regulated, well-adjusted and stable with respect to their mental health and interpersonal functioning. as such, it is my opinion that whilst [ms cygnis] may have suffered with an adjustment disorder at times in her life associated with significant stressors, such as the breakdown of her marriage and the [...] birth of her first child, such responses are normative, were not enduring and were not associated with any serious distress or functional impairment. similarly to the reasoning outlined above, it is my opinion that some weight should be placed on the accounts that [mr cygnis] has been prone to dysregulated, aggressive and at times, abusive behaviour towards others that has been frightening to [ms cygnis] and to [x], as well as causing [mr cygnis] difficulties in his relationships with his sisters and also in the workplace. i do not place much weight in [mr cygnis’] account of [ms cygnis] engaging in acts of aggression and abuse. it is also interesting that [mr cygnis] and [ms cygnis] provide accounts of the same incidents at times but these differ in who is identified as the responsible party. where there are discrepancies, i favour [ms cygnis’] account as being more likely accurate. as noted, [mr cygnis’] capacity for self-regulation has reportedly improved through psychological treatment but i suspect this is also likely a function of his not being in a high stress situation. it is my opinion that [mr cygnis] remains at risk for affective and behavioural dysregulation, which may also result in aggression, especially during periods of ill mental health and this will continue to present a risk to the children both psychologically and possibly physically. lastly, [mr cygnis] alleges that [ms cygnis] is working to alienate the children from him and discourage him from having any active involvement with or responsibility for the children. this assessment does not find convincing evidence for this allegation. rather, [ms cygnis] provided a balanced account at interview and she expressed support for [mr cygnis] and his role in the children’s lives. the children’s accounts to me did not reveal any evidence of manipulation or alienation and it appears that [ms cygnis] has actively worked to create opportunities for [mr cygnis] to have contact with the children since the parties separated with the exception of one period after which [mr cygnis’] behaviour was reportedly inappropriate with the children on a visit supervised by his sister. further to this, it would seem that [ms cygnis] has likely created opportunities for [mr cygnis] to be involved in sharing parental responsibility but he has not been forthcoming in this, including failing to contribute financially until ordered to do so by the child support agency. however, it does appear that [ms cygnis] has influenced the children’s views about their father and his mental health, such that they both have a story about [mr cygnis] that he suffers with ill mental health and engages in behaviour that is unsafe. i am of the view that [ms cygnis] has sought to create a narrative for the children to understand what has happened with their family and with the time they spend with their father. she has seemingly tried to do this in an honest way but in a manner that the children can make sense of, so as not to create more distress for them about the loss of their father in the family unit, who they both clearly love. i do not consider this evidence of alienation but rather, skilled and supportive parenting. in sum, it is my opinion that [mr cygnis] poses some risk to the children as a function of poor mental health and a proclivity to dysregulation. i also have concerns about his capacity to regulate in the presence of the children given his strong and fixed negative views about [ms cygnis]. i have no doubt that both parents in this case love their children and want the best for them, in addition to which both present with sound understanding of their role and responsibilities as a parent. however, [ms cygnis’] skills and capacity as a parent are more highly developed, which, no doubt, is at least in part a function of her greater experience in caring for the children. however, she is also the parent who is more capable of self-regulating and prioritising the children’s needs and experiences over her own. i also have concerns, as did [dr e], about how [mr cygnis] will cope with the children as they age and become more independent, especially if their views and wishes differ from his own. both children in this matter present as dynamic and engaging. however, [x] has a reported history of anxiety that his psychologist believes is a function of trauma related to his father. further to this, [y] is a loud and somewhat dysregulated child, who apparently has a history of some aggression. as such, both children need responsive, attuned and capable parenting and it is my opinion that [ms cygnis] is more capable of this than [mr cygnis], in addition to which she is also the parent who is more willing to be flexible and accommodate the children’s needs. both [x] and [y] clearly love their father and enjoy the time with him and both children also told me that they would like to spend more time with [mr cygnis] but both also express a preference for remaining in their mother’s care, where they feel safe, supported and cared for. terms of reference: you requested that the following terms of reference be addressed specifically in this report: the nature of the relationship and emotional attachment between the children and each parent – the children appear to have a close and connected bond with both their mother and father and the observations i made indicate that the children enjoy the time with each of their parents and are responsive to both [mr cygnis] and [ms cygnis]. however, both children identify their mother as their primary source of support and the one they would turn to if they needed anything. they also express a preference for remaining in the care of their mother, who has been their primary caregiver and attachment figure. whether, as a result of the assessments conducted, the expert considers there are any matters that may give rise to any concerns that the children are at risk of physical or psychological or other harm or abuse, in the care of either parent – i have discussed this in some detail above. in sum, there are a range of concerns in this case that give rise to the potential for [x] and [y] to be at risk psychologically and perhaps also physically in their father’s care. i do not consider [ms cygnis] to pose a risk to the children. i am mindful also of [ms cygnis’] allegations of [mr cygnis’] sexually abusive behaviour towards her during their marriage but this occurred within the context of an adult relationship and therefore, it seems unlikely that there is also tangible risk to the children sexually, although i acknowledge i did not assess this specifically, as i did not consider it relevant. assess the relationship between the children and each parent – this has been discussed above. each parent’s attitude towards the other and the likely effect of that attitude, if any, on the children, and the children’s relationship with the other parent – [ms cygnis’] account suggests that she maintains a balanced and generally supportive attitude towards her ex-husband. however, she has concerns for [ms cygnis’] mental health and the impact that this may have on the children and is therefore, seeking that any contact and relationship that the children may have with their father will be safe in order to protect the children. it is my opinion that [ms cygnis] is capable of facilitating and encouraging the children’s relationship with their father, as long as she considers it is safe to do so. [mr cygnis’] expressed attitude towards [ms cygnis] was angry and resentful and he took repeated opportunities throughout our interview to malign [ms cygnis] and speak in disparaging and critical ways. his views in this regard are fixed and highly negative and i understand that he has had difficulties regulating in the past, such that he has expressed his views about [ms cygnis] to others, including to or in front of the children. based on his presentation and account to me, i am of the view that [mr cygnis] will struggle to support [ms cygnis] as his coparent and to regulate his behaviour so as not to speak disparagingly or critically of [ms cygnis] in front of the children. each parent’s willingness and capacity to support the children’s relationship with the other parent and any other significant people – this has been addressed above with respect to both parents. however, it is also noted that [ms cygnis] expressed being supportive of the paternal family and their role in the children’s lives. the psychological health of each of the mother or the father and the impact of the same on each of the parent’s capacity to provide for the wellbeing of the children – i discussed this issue in some depth in my “opinion” section. in sum, there is no convincing evidence that [ms cygnis] is suffering with or has suffered with any notable or destabilising mental health concerns, including the [mental] symptomatology that [mr cygnis] reports for [ms cygnis]. as such, there is no evidence of any limitation or concern in [ms cygnis’] mental health that would, in any tangible way, impact adversely on her capacity to care for the children appropriately. [mr cygnis], on the other hand, does present with mental health concerns, although the exact nature of these is somewhat unclear. it is however, evident that he has little insight into his mental health, in addition to which [mr cygnis] has seemingly struggled to regulate both affectively and behaviourally in the past. i would expect this would be a future risk as well and may expose the children to both psychological and behavioural risk/harm. i also note that [x] is already demonstrating signs of anxiety, which is understood to be a response to traumatic experiences relating to [mr cygnis]. each parent’s capacity to provide for the children’s physical, emotional, social, psychological and practical needs, now and in the future – [ms cygnis] is the more skilled, capable and experienced parent however, [mr cygnis] also presents with sound understanding of the responsibilities of parenthood. he has some insight into his children’s needs but is also less willing to prioritise the children’s needs over his own. for the reasons outlined above, i also have concerns about [mr cygnis’] capacity to provide for the children’s needs for emotional, psychological and physical safety, especially if his mental health is poor or as the children age and become more independent. any wishes expressed by the children in relation to each of their parents, their living arrangements and any other factors which the expert considers are relevant to the weight that ought to be given to those wishes, including: the children’s respective age and maturity, the degree of appreciation by the children of the factors involved in the issue before the court and their longer term implication, the strength and duration of the wishes, whether or not the children’s wishes have been informed or influenced by any attitude, behaviour or conduct of either parent, or any other person in that child’s life – the children in this case are now aged six and ten years and both impress as eloquent and insightful children, especially [x]. the children both express love for their father and a desire to spend more time with [mr cygnis] and see his home but both [x] and [y] also indicate that their preference is to remain living with their mother, with whom they feel safe. they have been provided a narrative by their mother to understand what has happened with their family and although this obviously makes reference to [mr cygnis] being unwell mentally, [ms cygnis’] story is, in my view, honest, child-focussed and appropriate for children of this age. therefore, whilst [ms cygnis’] account has influenced the children, i do not consider this to be a function of any malintent on [ms cygnis’] behalf. further, this narrative for the children has given them some, developmentally appropriate, appreciation of the issues relevant to the court. for all these reasons, it is my view that some weight should be placed on the children’s wishes in considering any order made by the court. any recommendations as to professional medical and/or therapeutic/medical intervention, if any, the parties or the children should engage in – this will be discussed further below, under the subheading “recommendations”. any other matter which the expert considers to be significant to the court’s determination about what orders should be made in the best interests of the children and, any recommendations that the expert may wish to make in relation to the orders the court should make – i will discuss my recommendations in this matter below. there are no additional matters that the court should consider in my opinion that have not already been addressed in this report. recommendations: taking into account the significant range of information available to me in this case, including the interviews, assessments and testing with both parties, the interviews with the children, observation sessions, collateral sources of information and review of a substantial amount of documentation, i make the following recommendations as being in [x] and [y]’s best interests: that the children’s primary residence should remain with [ms cygnis]. that [ms cygnis] should hold primary parenting responsibility for the children. that [x] and [y] continue to have regular time with their father. i would recommend that this time occur on a fortnightly basis for up to four hours, consistent with the current orders. i am also of the view that based on [ms cygnis’] current functioning and insight, the time that he spends with the children should continue to be supervised. i do not believe however, that this needs to occur in a formal service setting, such as [b contact centre], but it may occur more organically in the community or perhaps in [mr cygnis’] home if an appropriate supervisor was available. that, in addition to the aforementioned visits, [mr cygnis] has telephone, or ideally video call, contact with the children up to three times in the week that he does not see them and twice in the week that he does. that [mr cygnis] should continue in psychological treatment, with [mr k] if he prefers and i would recommend that a copy of this report be provided to [mr k] to guide the intervention. that [mr cygnis] be assessed by a psychiatrist with a view to the suitability of psychotropic medication treatment. if this has not been considered before by either [dr e] or [dr l], i would recommend the differential diagnosis of [a mental illness] be addressed. again, i expect it would be helpful for any assessing psychiatrist to have a copy of this report to provide some context. that the parties communicate with one another via the family wizard app in relation to the children and that [ms cygnis] ensures that [mr cygnis] has access to information about the children’s education, medical needs and other important issues. that [x] continues to access psychological therapy in order to assist him with his anxiety and that [ms cygnis] refers [y] for assessment also in relation to her functioning and behaviour. that [mr cygnis] is able to have some involvement with the children’s school and activities as appropriate but that there should be limited contact between the parties at any such events. that consideration be given for facilitating time between the children and their father on significant dates, such as christmas, easter, birthdays and father’s day.
dr e’s report
iii. his ability to protect the children from abuse and/or neglect: it was [mr cygnis’] view that he had always been a good and loving dad. he asserted that he had been a good provider and a father for the children. he spoke of the close engagement with his son, [x], who shared his father's interest [...]. despite his asd, he viewed himself to be emotional attuned to the children's needs. [mr cygnis] asserted that he had provided the children with a consistent, stable and safe environment. he had worked full-time. the children provided with stable accommodation, food and their day-to-day needs. in addressing the issue of protecting the children from abuse and neglect, [mr cygnis] expressed his frustration at his exclusion from their current home environment. he asserted that [ms cygnis’] actions amounted to coercive control by restricting his contact over the past 15 months. the children had been consistent in their wishes to spend more time with him. they had expressed such wishes during the supervision at [b contact centre]. he expressed frustration that, as a man, there had been an assumption by the system that he was the perpetrator. he had been unable to obtain support as a victim from domestic violence helplines. [mr cygnis] asserted that the children were worried by the mother's behaviour. he asserted that her behaviour amounted to that of a woman who packs up the children and drives to the bridge. on the surface, the children looked like they had been well cared for but when he had tried to obtain additional information from the school, [ms cygnis] had repeatedly cut him out. it was noted that this account was disputed by the mother and that the paternal aunt had supported her in her views. it is a matter for the court to determine the factual basis-of the parties' competing claims. the only concern identified in this assessment related to his views of the mother given her actions to exclude him from the children's lives. this was identified to be a common response from fathers placed in such circumstances. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, the likely causes of [mr cygnis’] mental illness, disorder or mental health problem, including comment on any predisposing, precipitating or maintaining factors: both the asd and adhd are neurodevelopmental conditions which have been present throughout his life. he has difficulty coping with change. he has experienced a long history of stress related to bullying in the workplace. [mr cygnis] readily identified his stress as being reactive to the loss of his children, the loss of the family. the legal proceedings had provided additional stress at a time when he was already overloaded. he asserted that he was the victim of financial abuse, psychological abuse and physical abuse which had been perpetrated by [ms cygnis]. he asserted that he had ticked off every box on the abuse wheel. he spoke of his motivation for [ms cygnis] to get help for the sake of the children. he was frustrated that this had failed to be addressed by the court process. despite his challenging circumstances, he denied symptoms of an adjustment disorder with depressed or anxious mood. he identified his emotional response as proportional to his stressful circumstances. his social functioning had been significantly affected as [ms cygnis] had driven a wedge between himself and his youngest sister, [ms j], and his long-term friends of the church. nonetheless, his occupational function has been maintained except for the reduction in productivity given the need to attend medical and legal appointments. his depressed mood had been mild but he had experienced profound feelings of helplessness and hopelessness. although he felt the emotion, he reported that due to dysfunctional tear ducts he was unable to cry. he denied thoughts or acts of self-harm, suicidality or thoughts of harming others. given his circumstances. he had felt anxious, nervous and worried. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, the expert's prognosis for [mr cygnis’] mental illness, disorder or mental health problem, with and without treatment, including: an assessment of the likelihood of future mental health problems, and the long-term sequelae of any diagnosed mental illnesses, disorders or other mental health problems: the prognosis for [mr cygnis’] mental health issues was identified to be good. it was likely that he would continue to experience challenges regarding his social engagement and restricted daily activities. nonetheless, he had adapted to such issues over time. that said, he will remain vulnerable to episodic catastrophic reactions, including frustration, irritability, anxiety and depressed mood when challenged by circumstances outside his rigid cognitive set. this may pose challenges as the children grow up and the family circumstances change. although he has benefited from treatment to date, such vulnerabilities will continue to need to be managed as they will not be cured. his paranoid view that the mother's actions were solely motivated by her desire to harm him was of concern. the report writer considered it likely that at least some of his concerns had been misattributed. this was likely to be related to the obsessional hyperfocus associated with the asd. previous preoccupations had been expressed via [social media]. it was probable that he will continue to experience related concerns. in any problem or diagnosis is identified, the ways, if any, the identified illness, disorder or problem impacts on [mr cygnis’] capacity to communicate with others, including the children, with and without treatment: the asd had impacted upon his capacity to communicate with others. while he had benefited from his current treatment and has remained committed to ongoing intervention, when experiences are outside his rigid cognitive set, he will continue to experience frustration and difficulty. he will continue to benefit from support regarding this. that said, his focus on the children's needs may ameliorate the impact of this in his interactions with children. the mother asserted that this had been a significant problem to date. [ms cygnis], however, denied that this was the case. it is, however, the report writer's view that the developmental challenges of puberty and adolescence's additional challenges will raise additional hurdles. it is predictable that he will require additional guidance and support at that time. the report writer's opinion regarding his interactions with the children was limited by the lack of opportunity to observe his interactions with the children directly. both direct observation and a review of the [b contact centre] supervisors' reports would assist to address this deficit. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, your opinion as to [mr cygnis’] insight into his mental illness, disorder or other mental health problem including his ability to prevent the children being exposed to his. mental illness, disorder or other mental health problem, and his ability to regulate his own emotions: [mr cygnis] demonstrated significant insight into his mental illness. he asserted that he had the capacity to regulate his own emotion. this was supported by his treating psychologist who has been significant evidence of his patient's response treatment. that said, this continued to be disputed by the mother. he lacked the insight to consider alternative motivating factors for the mother beyond her desire to cause him harm. this paranoid view remained. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, any treatment, therapy or management you would recommend to address it and, if so, in what form and for what period of time: i would recommend that his current therapy be continued. this would be ongoing. both [mr cygnis] and his treating psychologist were motivated to pursue this intervention. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, your opinion as to [mr cygnis’] capacity to comply with and implement any treatment, therapy or management: [mr cygnis] was motivated to pursue ongoing individual psychotherapy with his current therapist. he had continued to find this beneficial. he was also enthusiastic to take up music therapy and pet therapy, as proposed by his therapist. that said, he acknowledged that he had the capacity to pursue music activities himself. he was limited in his capacity to own a pet given the restrictions in his apartment block. he may benefit from offering his services as a local dog walker should he be unable to own his own dog. he had complied with therapy and implemented strategies to date. there was no indication that he lacked the capacity to comply with or implement the required therapy and management. although he was identified to be resistant to medication, this assessment did not identify any specific indication for pharmacotherapy. any other aspect of the psychiatric or psychological health of [mr cygnis] which in your opinion may have an effect on his ability to provide for the wellbeing of the children: this assessment did not identify any other aspect of his psychiatric or psychological health which impaired his parenting capacity. [mr cygnis], based on his self-report, was not identified to have any impairment in his capacity to provide for the well-being of the children. that said, the report writer noted that this was strongly disputed by the mother. her account identified persistent concerns regarding such matters. it is a matter for the court to determine the factual basis of the parties' competing claims. any other aspect of the psychiatric or psychological health of [mr cygnis] which in your opinion may present a risk (physical, psychological and/or emotional) to the children: this assessment did not identify any issues presenting a risk to the children. that said, this was strongly disputed by the mother, who identified persistent behaviour of concern. this was disputed by [mr cygnis]. he asserted that he was a victim of ongoing abuse and gaslighting perpetrated by the mother. his account was consistent with his affidavit material. he assertively dismissed the mother's allegations that he had placed the children at risk, or that he had assaulted her as claimed. an enquiry into his psychosexual development faileq. to identify any abnormalities. he was identified to have maintained a series of long-term relationships with former partners. he denied any history of abusive behaviour towards any of his previous partners, including the mother. he disclosed developmental exposure as an adolescent to sexual touching by his teacher, who was subsequently convicted of paedophilia. he did not, however, identify that this had affected his psychosexual development. he reported that he had managed this challenging circumstance in an assertive manner. that said, it is a matter for the court to determine matters of fact regarding the competing narratives about the couple's sexual relationship. this assessment did not identify that such matters placed the children at risk.
... [mr cygnis] discussed his grievances regarding family court process. he viewed this as typical of the experience of many men. he referenced the findings of the joint select committee into australia's family law as addressed by the senate committee [in 2021]. it remained his view that he had features of an autistic spectrum disorder (asd). he understood that [mr k] had retracted his previous diagnosis [...] and agreed that [another] was more appropriate. the report writer noted that this was supported by [mr k]'s assessment using the ados and adi and that [dr f] had failed to acknowledge this in her report. [mr cygnis] emphasised his respect for the professional reputation of [mr k]. mr k had subsequently retired from practice in [city m] and relocated [interstate]. he had thus transferred to a new psychologist, [ms n]. ... his affect (emotional responsiveness) remained odd and incongruous as he continued in his account. he talked about his friendships with his neighbours. he discussed his employment. he was readily engaged in the gym. he had recently commenced training with a personal trainer. he assertively denied having ever experienced symptoms of hypomania or mania. he specifically denied having experienced elevated mood, grandiosity, pressured and racing thoughts, and disinhibited behaviour. he viewed his behaviour to be "fairly normal". that said, he identified sensitivity to [...] fluorescent light buzzing. he would hyperfocus, which he related to his attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). he tended to be distracted. he denied symptoms of thought disorder. he viewed himself to have had "only typical adhd symptoms, like a squirrel, being distracted by a dog". ... he continued in his criticism of [dr f]' s praise of the mother for her approach to the children's care. this included the mother cutting him out of the children's lives and key events due to her lies and manipulation. this had continued despite the positive reports from [b contact centre]. he repeated that it was very frustrating. when asked about the strategies developed with [ms n], he explained that the overriding focus had been ongoing management of stress and anxiety regarding the family court process. he provided an account of the mindfulness techniques, which included deep breathing, cognitive behaviour therapy, listening to music, performing music and regular exercise. ... he spoke of the loss that he had experienced on the retirement of his previous psychologist. he provided an overinclusive account of this issue. when taken to the potential need for treatment for adhd, he stated that he remained functional. he did not see any need for medication to address his symptoms. he reported only minor issues with forgetting things and a little disorganisation there was some hyperfocus. he would become forgetful and disorganised at home but denied problems in the workplace. he denied that it generally impaired his level of functioning. he did, however, have a different way of thinking. ... whether [mr cygnis] currently suffers from a mental illness, disorder or other mental health problem using the dsm-5 diagnostic criteria: this updated assessment identified that [mr cygnis] continued to experience the issues previously identified. there had been no significant change in his mental state since the previous assessment. this review failed to identify symptoms diagnostic of [mental illnesses] as postulated by [dr f]. this view is consistent with the assessment previously conducted by the report writer, the views of both his treating psychologists, and the findings of a previous psychiatric assessment. as previously identified, [mr cygnis] continued to report symptoms indicative of autistic spectrum disorder (asd), which had continued into adulthood with comorbid attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). it should, however, be noted that such diagnoses do rely on the accuracy of [mr cygnis’] account of his lived experience. if any psychiatric disorder or other problem is identified, the severity of the psychiatric disorder or problem: these conditions were of mild severity. he did not identify significant adhd symptoms which impaired his level of functioning. as such, no indication was identified for intervention with medication. if any problem or diagnosis is identified in relation to [mr cygnis], the ways, if any, the identified illness, disorder or problem impacts on his functioning, with and without treatment: based on his self-report, [mr cygnis] did not have current adhd symptoms which impaired his functioning. if any problem or diagnosis is identified in relation to [mr cygnis], the ways, if any, the identified illness, disorder or problem impacts on [mr cygnis’] parenting capacity, with and without treatment, and in particular: his ability to provide for the children's emotional and intellectual needs, his ability to provide the children with a consistent, stable and safe environment that will meet their needs now and into the future, his ability to protect the children from abuse and/or neglect: my opinion remains unchanged in this regard. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, the likely causes of [mr cygnis’] mental illness, disorder or mental health problem, including comment on any predisposing, precipitating or maintaining factors: my opinion remains unchanged in this regard. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, the expert's prognosis for [mr cygnis’] mental illness, disorder or mental health problem, with and without treatment, including: an assessment of the likelihood of future mental health problems, and the long-term sequelae of any diagnosed mental illnesses, disorders or other mental health problems: my opinion remains unchanged in this regard. it was likely that he will continue to experience interpersonal difficulties and problems with affect (emotional) regulation. although medications [...] may be indicated in such presentations, this assessment failed to identify current symptomatology requiring such intervention. i found no indication that he was at risk of developing a psychotic illness or mood disorder. in any problem or diagnosis is identified, the ways, if any, the identified illness, disorder or problem impacts on [mr cygnis’] capacity to communicate with others, including the children, with and without treatment: [mr cygnis] had previously experienced issues in his workplace and in his relationships. his lack of empathy and insight into the impact of his behaviour is likely to continue to affect his interpersonal functioning. this is unlikely to change. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, your opinion as to [mr cygnis’] insight into his mental illness, disorder or other mental health problem including his ability to prevent the children being exposed to his mental illness, disorder or other mental health problem, and his ability to regulate his own emotions: [mr cygnis] continued to minimise the extent of his problems or his contribution to his family and interpersonal difficulties. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, any treatment, therapy or management you would recommend to address it and, if so, in what form and for what period of time: i am supportive of his current therapy with [ms n]. if any problem or diagnosis is identified, your opinion as to [mr cygnis’] capacity to comply with and implement any treatment, therapy or management: he was motivated to continue the current intervention. any other aspect of the psychiatric or psychological health of [mr cygnis] which in your opinion may have an effect on his ability to provide for the wellbeing of the children: my opinion remains unchanged in this regard. any other aspect of the psychiatric or psychological health of [mr cygnis] which in your opinion may present a risk (physical, psychological and/or emotional) to the children: my opinion remains unchanged in this regard. this further assessment did not identify any additional risk (physical, psychological and/or emotional) to the children. i am thus supportive of the graded introduction of contact as recommended by [ms g].
the joint report of dr e & dr f
a one-hour conference of experts was convened at 12pm on 19 july 2023 to address the difference of opinion between the two appointed court experts, [dr e] and [dr f]. it was noted that [dr e] had met with the father, [mr cygnis] in 2021 and 2023. [dr f] had assessed both [mr cygnis] and the family in a more comprehensive report at the start of 2022. [dr f] had not been provided with the most recent family report prepared earlier this year by [ms g] but she was provided with the most recent report of [dr e]. the primary difference in opinion between the experts was in relation to [mr cygnis’] mental health and the most appropriate diagnoses to describe this. the relevance of [mr cygnis’] mental health in relation to any possible risk to the children is also of note. [dr f] reiterated her concerns regarding the father's presentation. it was noted that there were inconsistencies in his account to the two report writers regarding his developmental history and mental health. he disclosed to [dr e], a history of developmental trauma, identifying child sexual abuse perpetrated by a teacher as an adolescent. [dr f] identified that he had specifically denied any history of sexual trauma. [mr cygnis] disclosed to [dr f] a history of hypomanic symptomatology which was denied when questioned by [dr e]. to [dr f], he had disclosed episodic pressured thinking, elevated levels of activity, pressured sex drive, pressured thinking, periods of increased creativity and grandiosity. this had led to her question about the possibility of a mood disorder or [a mental disorder]. it was evident that [dr e] had given greater weight to the history obtained from [mr cygnis], whilst [dr f] had considered [ms cygnis], who was not interviewed by [dr e], to be likely to be the more reliable historian. it was agreed that [mr cygnis] was an intelligent individual. given his evidently strong identification with the diagnoses of autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, [dr f] considered it possible that he had constructed his narrative to reflect these disorders. she noted that he reported to have researched these conditions and within this context, had potentially ascribed unrelated symptoms to these diagnoses. [dr e] agreed that this was possible. these diagnoses have been supported by his previous treating psychologist, [mr k]. it was understood that [dr e] had given significant weight to these findings. [dr f] however questioned the veracity of this opinion and gave limited weight to the assessment conducted by him. although she accepted that it was possible that there were mild to moderate symptomatology of autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, it remained her view that this did not adequately and fully explain his history of emotional volatility, poor impulse control paranoid/persecutory preoccupations, rigid and at times, possibly disordered thinking which had affected his functioning across both domestic and work domains. it was agreed that [mr cygnis] demonstrated rigidity of thinking. he was perseverative in his focus. he downplayed issues of concern regarding his functioning. [dr f] identified his paranoid and persecutory preoccupations. multiple sources had identified his long-standing tendency to rant and rave in a dysregulated manner. this had caused problems in the workplace, as documented in his experience at [o company]. he had consistently minimized such matters when interviewed by [dr e]. that said, [dr f] agreed with the findings of [dr e] and [dr l] that there was a lack of evidence to diagnose a psychotic illness or mood disorder. it was agreed that there was no indication that [mr cygnis] would present to a treating psychiatrist in a manner which would result in treatment with psychotropic medication. it remained [dr e]'s view that he did not have a condition which was likely to resolve with medical treatment. consideration was given to the possibility of [mr cygnis] having an underlying personality disorder with paranoid and narcissistic traits. this was considered possible. this would explain his long-standing paranoid preoccupations and interpersonal/behavioural difficulties. [dr f] remained concerned by the potential impact on [mr cygnis’] parenting capacity of such thinking and behaviour. [dr e] agreed that should such behaviour continue in the presence of the children that they would be potentially placed at risk. that said, he identified [mr cygnis’] apparent insight whilst assuring [dr e] that he would never act in such a manner in the presence of the children or undermine the mother. [dr f] questioned [mr cygnis’] capacity to follow through on such an undertaking given his previous behaviour, which includes his presentation and account at interview with her, the account of [ms cygnis], of [x] and of [mr cygnis’] sister. given her assessment of family, she remained concerned about the potential impact upon the children. although [dr e] identified that [x] was now 12 years of age and [y] 8 years of age, [dr f] identified [x] to be a vulnerable boy, who had already been exposed to a disruptive developmental experience due to his father's volatile mood and behaviour, which has resulted in considerable anxiety for [x]. [dr e] identified that both [dr f] and [ms g] having conducted a family assessment were better informed regarding the family dynamics.
ms g’s report
... [ms cygnis] alleged that [mr cygnis] would throw objects at her, push her and lunge at her. [ms cygnis] alleged that, when [y] was six months old, [mr cygnis] picked [y] up by her two fingers and would slap her while changing her nappy. [ms cygnis] alleged that [mr cygnis] threatened to stab [x] with a [weapon] after [x] tried to get his attention during dinner. [ms cygnis] was of the view that [mr cygnis] could not recall his alleged actions after they occurred “as he was in an overwhelmed trance like state due to [his preoccupation with government]”. [ms cygnis] alleged that [mr cygnis] would become angry and try to lunge at [x] when [x] tried to get his attention. [ms cygnis] alleged that [mr cygnis] sexually abused her resulting in bruises to her arms from being pinned down by [mr cygnis]. [ms cygnis] alleged that [mr cygnis] would send her lengthy messages accusing her of being with multiple men and that [mr cygnis] behaviour became threatening when he thought about her being in a relationship with someone else. [ms cygnis] alleged that, after separation, [mr cygnis] has attempted to touch her on the buttocks and has made sexualised noises towards her. [ms cygnis] described the incident in [late] 2022, which resulted in the current fvo. [ms cygnis] reported that [mr cygnis] attended [y]’s school concert and allegedly told other parents, while mimicking sexualised noises, that [ms cygnis] had been having sexual intercourse with multiple partners. [ms cygnis] alleged that [mr cygnis] told other parents that she has stopped him from seeing the children and that the government favour women in family law situations. [ms cygnis] was of the view that [mr cygnis] was unable to regulate his behaviour on this occasion, and reported that the school took action to prevent their children from witnessing [mr cygnis’] alleged behaviour. ... [ms cygnis] reported she would be concerned if the children’s time with [mr cygnis] became unsupervised as it may place the children at risk of physical and emotional harm, if [mr cygnis] is unable to regulate his behaviour. [ms cygnis] specified that she is concerned that [mr cygnis] may be aggressive, violent, or neglectful towards the children. [ms cygnis] appeared open to the possibility of [mr cygnis] spending unsupervised time with the children if [mr cygnis] took steps to improve his parenting capacity, including knowledge as to whether [mr cygnis] has a diagnosis of [a mental illness] as suggested by [dr f]. [ms cygnis] confirmed that the children’s time with [mr cygnis] has not progressed to unsupervised or overnight time due to the concerns she holds about [mr cygnis’] conduct. [ms cygnis] expressed concern that, if the children spent time with [mr cygnis] overnight, he may have difficulty managing the children’s routines and making decisions, as “i parent and inform him of things, he does not involve himself or respond”. ... [ms cygnis] said, “i truly want him [mr cygnis] to have a relationship with the children...if he was stable [mentally] and we were seeing the changes, i would do everything possible to enable that relationship. i won’t cross a line if they [the children] are unsafe”. [ms cygnis] reported that she always explains to [x] and [y] that [mr cygnis’] behaviour is “how he operates” and that she has never said a bad word about [mr cygnis] to the children. ... seen first, prior to the children’s observation, [mr cygnis] began to blame [ms cygnis] for him not being notified about his appointments. the following day, at interview, [mr cygnis] was calm and initially appeared nervous which subsided as the interview progressed. at times, [mr cygnis] would divert off‑topic and remain focused on [ms cygnis], however, was able to display insight into the children’s needs and answer the questions. [mr cygnis] said that he disagreed that the children’s time with him needs to be supervised and was of the view that the children’s time with him is only supervised because it is what [ms cygnis] wanted. [mr cygnis] advised that he is not spending time with the children every tuesday supervised by ‘[h contact centre’], as per the current order, due to the cost of the service. [mr cygnis] advised that all communication with [ms cygnis] is conducted through ‘our family wizard’ and that he chooses to not respond to [mr cygnis’] messages as, “when i respond, she [ms cygnis] manipulates it, twists it, and uses it in court. [mr cygnis] stated that receiving photos and videos of the children from [ms cygnis] is useful as it provides him with topics about which he can speak to the children. [mr cygnis] confirmed that his former partner [ms p] is able to supervise his time with the children and that the children have met her once at [y]’s birthday party. ... [mr cygnis] alleged that [ms cygnis] damaged his relationships with his family and with mutual friends to the point where “i had to restart my life and make new friends”. [mr cygnis] alleged that [ms cygnis] has, stolen his money from a joint bank account, limited his access to his possessions, provided false information to his general practitioner and placed malware on his mobile phone to listen to private conversations. [mr cygnis] alleged that [ms cygnis] has “stalked” his [social media] profile to find information to use in her affidavits, which reportedly involved looking through 18 months of social media posts. [mr cygnis] was of the view that [ms cygnis’] employment with [q company] means she has access to [sensitive information], who could have assisted her with the malware. [mr cygnis] was unsure whether [ms cygnis] would have access to weapons however, he noted that [ms cygnis] works with [employees] who carry [weapons]. [mr cygnis] denied [ms cygnis’] allegations regarding the incident at the children’s school in [late] 2022 and was of the view the fvo was an attempt by [ms cygnis] to “keep me away and rob me of the opportunity [to be involved with the children]”. [mr cygnis] alleged that [ms cygnis] had blocked him from exiting the school and that he did not provide any details to other parents about the court proceedings except to say that he and [ms cygnis] were in family law proceedings. [mr cygnis] advised he accepted the fvo on a non-admissions basis and alleged that the independent children’s’ lawyer deliberately delayed obtaining a subpoena from the children’s school about the incident until the fvo was in effect as “the evidence from the school supported what i had said [about the incident]”. [mr cygnis] agreed with [ms cygnis’] narrative that her sister had written to his church, which resulted in him no longer being in the church [activities]. [mr cygnis] advised that the church made the decision to remove him from [social activities] after they became aware [mr cygnis] was in a relationship that was not aligned with their values. [mr cygnis] alleged that [ms cygnis] had her sister notify his church in an attempt to disrupt his therapy, which uses [social activities] as a therapeutic tool. ... [mr cygnis] reported that he does not use drugs and consumes alcohol on social occasions, however, he remains under the legal blood alcohol limit. [mr cygnis] reported that he is diagnosed with asd and adhd and has been supported by a psychologist for the past five years. [mr cygnis] said he currently sees [ms n] once per month and they mostly focus on strategies to assist with his diagnoses. [mr cygnis] reported that he is of excellent physical health although alleged that, shortly after their separation, [ms cygnis] was “setting me up to have a heart attack so she can get my life insurance”. ... [mr cygnis] described his relationship with the children before separation as “loving, active and happy”. post-separation, [mr cygnis] described his relationship with the children as “absent, institutionalised and resilient” and that the children view him as “loving, supportive and fun”. [mr cygnis] identified his parenting strengths to be, the encouragement and support he gives the children, trying to understand the needs of the children, and provide for the children. [mr cygnis] said that he is pleased with how he has responded to the children when they have asked him questions and that at times, he deflects their questions so that he does not expose the children to the parental dispute. [mr cygnis] advised that he does not speak about [ms cygnis], as it is not helpful for the children to hear negativity. ... [mr cygnis] had difficulty identifying how he could improve on his parenting and attributed this to the current environment in which he sees the children. [mr cygnis] became focused on the court proceedings and [ms cygnis], however, was able to redirect his focus with some prompting and encouragement. [mr cygnis] identified that, due to his diagnoses, he openly displays frustration and that, the children may see this and feel that it is directed at them. [mr cygnis] reported that he would like to become more skilled at not becoming frustrated in front of the children. [mr cygnis] was of the view that it is unreasonable to expect him to behave in a neuro-typical manner when he is neuro-diverse and that he becomes more frustrated when he perceives he is being punished for something he cannot help. [mr cygnis] reported that he has attended circle of security and [cc program] in addition to seeking informal parenting advice from online resources and other parents. ... [mr cygnis] reported that, during the court proceedings, he had been told that, if he had a large enough home, he could have the children overnight, however, the family report completed by [dr f] “screwed me”. [mr cygnis] reported that he had to sell his [home] and that, due to currently renting a one-bedroom [home], it is unlikely that he would be able to care for the children overnight. [mr cygnis] acknowledged that, considering the children’s commitments, it would be unfair to expect the children to spend time with him every weekend. [mr cygnis] was of the view that the current arrangement, which is “institutionalised”, does not provide enough time with the children. [mr cygnis] proposed that he would like unsupervised time with the children every alternate weekend for a full day or half a day in addition to time during the week after-school. [mr cygnis] reported that he is open to different ideas about how changeovers could occur and does not want to engage with [ms cygnis], as “i want my abuser to be out of my life”. ... [mr cygnis] reported that if the current arrangement were to remain in place, he would be concerned that the children would become “fully institutionalised, estranged from me and feel the effects of fatherlessness”. [mr cygnis] stated he wants to continue to focus on the needs of the children and caring for them without focusing on the past, and that he does not want to speak to the children about what has occurred until they are adults and able to ask their own questions. ... [x] (subject child) [x] presented as an insightful child who appeared developmentally slightly above his chronological age. [x] presented as clear in his views however, at times, appeared hesitant to share his views due to being aware that [mr cygnis] would read his responses. [x] presented as a child who is competitive and focused on winning which may be indicative he is a child who places pressure on himself to succeed. [x] reported he is commencing year 6 in 2023 at [r school], where he enjoys [arts] and dislikes no aspect of school. [x] said that he has three best friends and they often attempt to play games but get distracted due to talking with each other. [x] said that, in his spare time, he enjoys playing video games, [sporting activities and the arts]. [x] identified that his family consists of “mum [ms cygnis], sister [y], me, [the dog], grandma and grandad [on both the paternal and maternal side], aunts and uncles, dad [mr cygnis] and mum’s boyfriend [mr s] and his children”. [x] described an age appropriate routine, which consists of attending school, attending before and after-school care, attending extra-curricular activities and going to bed at 9pm. [x] described [ms cygnis] as “very nice, fun and helps us through hard times as she is mentally strong”. [x] said that, when with [ms cygnis], they like to watch movies, play ‘[games]’ and talk. [x] said there is are no negative aspects of being with [ms cygnis], but that he would like to have more than one parent living with him (referring to [mr cygnis]). [x] advised that he had “no exact words” to describe [mr cygnis], as “i don’t see him that much and don’t know him as well”. [x] said that, when with [mr cygnis], they like to play [board games and sporting activities]. [x] was of the view that sometimes [mr cygnis] will “ramble on about things” and stated, “i have gone through a lot and a raise of tone [a raised voice] traumatises me a lot as dad [mr cygnis] used to shout a lot”. [x] was of the view that [mr cygnis] only listens to topics in which he is interested, and that he will tell lies to win at games or call people a cheater if he loses a game, including telling [x] that [x] is cheating. [x] said that he gets upset when [mr cygnis] says that people are cheating at games and that, when they spend supervised time together, [mr cygnis] is “on his best behaviour”. [x] identified that, when he is feeling sad, he speaks to [ms cygnis], and when he is feeling excited, he speaks to [ms cygnis], [y] and his friends. [x] said that he knows when [ms cygnis] is angry because she will raise her voice slightly, and that he knows when [mr cygnis] is angry because he “does a face, i don’t like it at all, he has an angry tone”. [x] said that, as a form of discipline, [ms cygnis] would remove his access to screen time or separate him and [y]. [x] said that [mr cygnis] used to smack him on the buttocks and make him write lines. [x] reported that him and [y] will ask [ms cygnis] questions about [mr cygnis] which [ms cygnis] will respond to, or she will mention [mr cygnis] “if things change with dad, such as rules”, but overall, [ms cygnis] “keeps a lot away from us” (referring to the court proceedings). [x] reported that [mr cygnis] sometimes talks about [ms cygnis] as “he [mr cygnis] thinks she [ms cygnis] has done bad things”. [x] advised he did not want to speak further about what [mr cygnis] has said about [ms cygnis], as he [x] is “an empathetic person, who does not want to upset either parent”. [x] wished that he could spend time with [mr cygnis] in [mr cygnis’] home, to have a “slightly” larger home for [ms cygnis], and for the family to be “how it used to be when mum [ms cygnis] and dad [mr cygnis] were together. [x] advised he would like to spend every second saturday with [mr cygnis] as per the current arrangement but have “45 minutes to one hour” extra time with [mr cygnis]. [x] said that he would like speak to [mr cygnis] over the phone three times a week on a monday, wednesday and sunday. [x] was of the view that his time with [mr cygnis] should remain supervised as, “when we see dad [mr cygnis] unsupervised, dad said something bad about mum [ms cygnis]”. [y] (subject child) [y] presented as a softly spoken, happy child who seemed developmentally slightly below her chronological age. [y]’s speech was, at times, difficult to understand as she spoke using ‘baby-talk’, which appeared to improve after her interview. [y] appeared reluctant to speak about either of her parents. [y] reported she is commencing year 2 in 2023 at [r school] where she enjoys [art subjects]. [y] said she has two best friends and that they talk “a lot”. [y] said that, in her spare time, she likes to play with her dog, her toys and her ipad, and dislikes having to pack up her toys after she is finished playing with them. [y] described an age appropriate routine where she attends school, attends extracurricular activities and listens to music before going to sleep. [y] identified that her family consists of “dad [mr cygnis], mum [ms cygnis], brother [x], me and my dog”. [y] described both of her parents as “fun” and “happy” and that when she spends time with either parent, they “have fun”. [y] reported that she does not feel sad, scared or worried when spending time with [ms cygnis] and [mr cygnis]. [y] said that when she is feeling sad, she will speak to her dog and [ms cygnis], and when she is feeling excited, she speaks to “everyone”. [y] reported that, sometimes, [ms cygnis] would speak about [mr cygnis] when [x] asks questions and that [mr cygnis] does not speak about [ms cygnis]. [y] said that she would like to spend time with [mr cygnis] and speak with [mr cygnis] over the telephone, as per the current arrangement. ... this brief observation suggests that [mr cygnis] has the capacity to provide affection, structure and guidance to the children, and remain calm when the children are displaying challenging behaviours. the observation identified concerns that [x] was attempting to provoke [mr cygnis], which may suggest that [x] is testing [mr cygnis] to determine how he will respond. ... this brief observation suggests that [ms cygnis] is able to re-assure, comfort and support the children. both children appeared to be comfortable and confident in the presence of [ms cygnis] and responded to [ms cygnis’] guidance and implementation of boundaries during times of sibling conflict. ... evaluation this assessment considers the future time-spending arrangements for [x] aged 11 years and [y] aged seven years. during this assessment, [x]’s narrative suggests that he was hesitant to speak freely about [mr cygnis] and [y]’s narrative suggests that she was hesitant to speak freely about both her parents. it seems that neither child, in particular [x], wished to upset either parent. akin to the report of [dr e] filed on 5 march 2021, [mr cygnis] accepts his diagnoses of asd and adhd, and he has followed the advice of [dr e] regarding continual psychological intervention. similar to [dr f]’s report, this assessment has identified that, at times, [x] attempts to push boundaries with [mr cygnis] by displaying challenging behaviours and mocking him. as the children become more independent, [mr cygnis] may have difficulty implementing boundaries and rules in response to the children’s challenging behaviours. in contrast to [dr f]’s report, [mr cygnis] denies that he poses a risk to the children and believes he does not meet the diagnostic criteria for [a mental illness]. despite [x] being reluctant to share information that may upset [mr cygnis], [x] presented as clear in his views and mature in his presentation. for this reason, it is suggested that increased weight is given to [x]’s views. during [y]’s interview, [y] appeared to have difficulty in providing information about her parents and her speech appeared to regress. for these reasons, it is suggested that reduced weight is given to [y]’s views. [y]’s presentation could suggest that she was fearful or worried about upsetting either parent or alternatively did not feel comfortable to share her views with the author, and regressed in her speech as a coping or avoidance mechanism. neither child presented as being pressured by either parent to speak negatively about the other parent. the primary concern in this matter is how much time [x] and [y] should spend with [mr cygnis] and whether this time should be supervised. related to this issue are the concerns about [mr cygnis’] mental health. the current arrangement for the children to spend supervised time with [mr cygnis] at the [b contact centre] supported contact program each alternate saturday for two hours, does not appear in the best interests of the children. while this arrangement provides the children with the opportunity to spend time with [mr cygnis], this arrangement limits the children’s ability to develop a meaningful relationship with [mr cygnis] due to the constraints associated with the time spent in a restricted and artificial environment. both parents discussed the possibility of [mr cygnis’] former partner [ms p] acting a supervisor of the children during their time with [mr cygnis]. [mr cygnis’] narrative suggested that she is uncomfortable with having [ms p] supervise the children’s time with [ms cygnis] due to not knowing [ms p] and not knowing if [ms p] is aware of the concerns she holds for [mr cygnis’] mental health. it is outside of the scope of this assessment to determine whether [ms p] would be an appropriate person to supervise the children’s time with [mr cygnis] and this may be a matter for the court to determine. unless the court determines [mr cygnis] poses a risk to the children, it seems unviable for the children’s time with [mr cygnis] to be supervised on a long‑term basis and it will likely be beneficial for the children to have increased time with [mr cygnis] including [mr cygnis] supporting the children to attend their extracurricular activities. extracurricular activities would provide a structured environment for the children to spend time with [mr cygnis] in the presence of other adults who have mandatory reporting obligations. both children are of an age where they could seek help and safety from another adult if necessary, particularly if they are together. it will be in the children’s best interests for [mr cygnis] to have a plan to work towards the children having safe unsupervised time with him. if the children continue to spend time with [mr cygnis] solely in a supervised contact centre, the children may begin to question why their experiences of their father differ to those of other children, which may damage their relationship with both parents. in addition, providing [mr cygnis] with a plan gives [mr cygnis] the opportunity to take ownership of his choices and an incentive to seek clarity regarding his mental health rather than blaming the circumstances on [ms cygnis]. due to the financial cost of formal supervision, there is the risk that [mr cygnis] may not always be able to afford the expense which may result in the children no longer being able to spend time with [mr cygnis]. both parents’ narratives suggest that, at times, they have historically, both used physical chastisement to discipline the children, and that [mr cygnis] would continue to use physical chastisement as a form of discipline. the impression gained was that [ms cygnis] was pressured by [mr cygnis] during their relationship to use physical chastisement to discipline the children. neither child reported that their parents use physical chastisement. this may be because [ms cygnis] does not use physical chastisement on the children and because the children’s time with [mr cygnis] is currently supervised. physically disciplining the children is a poor choice of discipline because it can detrimentally affect a child’s self-esteem, negatively affect their ability to trust a parent, and cause them to become fearful of a parent. in addition, there is a risk that [x] or [y] could be seriously injured through physical discipline. given [mr cygnis’] admission that he uses physical chastisement, he would benefit from attending a parenting course aimed at developing alternative strategies to discipline. both parents’ narratives suggest that [mr cygnis] has diagnoses of asd and adhd although [ms cygnis’] narrative alleges that [mr cygnis] may have an additional and unknown mental health diagnosis. it is not within the scope of this assessment to comment on the causes of [mr cygnis’] behaviours including whether [mr cygnis’] behaviours are associated with his diagnoses, are an indication of an alternative diagnoses or are an indication that [mr cygnis] is struggling with grief and loss associated with the end of his marriage. the brief observation between [mr cygnis] and the children did not identify concerns that [mr cygnis’] mental health may be negatively affecting his parenting capacity. if the children have been exposed to adverse parental mental health, this may have compromised the children’s emotional and physical safety, routine and stability. it seems that historically, [ms cygnis’] experiences of alleged family violence may have negatively affected her mental health and possibly her parenting capacity. [ms cygnis] reported having strategies in place to support her mental health and to bolster her parenting capacity, which would mitigate the risk of the children being exposed to any emotional vulnerability of [ms cygnis]. the children would benefit from [ms cygnis] continuing to engage with her psychologist. this assessment identified that [mr cygnis] can become hyperfocused on [ms cygnis] and, at times, he appeared excessively worried that [ms cygnis] may be trying to harm him. [mr cygnis] denied that he speaks about [ms cygnis] in front of the children therefore it is unclear whether [mr cygnis’] hyperfocus on [ms cygnis] is known to the children. if [mr cygnis] were to become hyperfocused on [ms cygnis] while in the presence of the children, it is likely that the children would have difficulty diverting [mr cygnis’] focus resulting in them hearing negative views about [ms cygnis]. if the children were to witness any emotional vulnerability experienced by [mr cygnis], this could negatively affect the children’s wellbeing, sense of safety and their relationship with [mr cygnis]. if [mr cygnis] ensures that he is aware of any diagnoses and follows recommended treatments, this will likely reduce the risk of the children being exposed to [mr cygnis’] emotional vulnerabilities. the children will benefit from [mr cygnis] continuing to engage with his psychologist. due to the contrasting views of [dr e] and [dr f], it may also benefit [mr cygnis] to obtain an updated psychiatric assessment. [ms cygnis’] allegations of family violence suggest that, during their relationship and post separation, [mr cygnis] may have used emotional abuse, physical abuse, sexual abuse and threatening behaviours. it is concerning that [ms cygnis] has alleged that, post separation, and as recently as six months ago, [mr cygnis] has continued to intimidate, harass and denigrate [ms cygnis], including making sexual noises in front of the children’s peers and other parents. [mr cygnis’] alleged recent behaviour towards [ms cygnis] has resulted in an fvo and [ms cygnis] reported continuing to remain fearful of [mr cygnis]. if true, [ms cygnis’] allegations against [mr cygnis] suggest a lack of insight into respectful boundaries, a lack of insight into the children’s needs, including the impact of his behaviours on the children’s developmental needs, and limited prospects of a productive co-parenting relationship. [mr cygnis’] allegations of family violence suggest that [ms cygnis] may have, during their relationship and post-separation, used emotional abuse, physical abuse, threatening and controlling behaviours. despite [mr cygnis] being worried that [ms cygnis] may be attempting to sabotage his relationship with the children, [mr cygnis] agreed that the current fvo is helping to limit his interactions with [ms cygnis]. if [ms cygnis’] allegations against [ms cygnis] are true, it suggests a lack of insight into respectful boundaries and a lack of insight into the children’s needs including the children having a meaningful relationship with [mr cygnis]. both parents present as parents who love [x] and [y] deeply and want what is best for the children. individually, both parents appeared able to appropriate respond and reassure the children. [mr cygnis’] presentation suggests that he is able to provide guidance and affection to the children, however may be at risk of having disagreements with the children particularly as they become older and exert their independence. based on the allegations made by [ms cygnis] and the findings of [dr f], the children may be at risk of emotional or physical harm should a disagreement occur and should [mr cygnis] have difficulty in remaining calm in his responses. [mr cygnis’] ability regulate his emotions, in order to prevent further escalation, will be best supported through [mr cygnis] having clarity regarding his mental health diagnoses, strengthening his parenting skills through parenting courses and the opportunity to integrate learning into practice. [ms cygnis’] presentation suggests that she provides stability, safety, encouragement and reassurance to the children, however, may need some assistance to implement rules and boundaries as the children become older and exert their independence. [ms cygnis] may benefit from attending a parenting course in preparation for the children entering adolescence. [ms cygnis] and [mr cygnis] present as having a limited and minimal co‑parenting relationship where there is no joint decision making regarding the children. unfortunately, neither parent appeared hopeful that their co‑parenting relationship could improve despite the use of a parenting communication ‘app’ and the completion of a post-separation parenting course. there is concern that the parents’ poor capacity to communicate about [x] and [y]’s needs may result in decisions about the children being delayed. [ms cygnis’] proposal that the children spend time with [mr cygnis] as per the current arrangement seems to be based on [ms cygnis] wanting to ensure the children maintain a relationship with [mr cygnis] while having safety through [b contact centre] providing supervision. a benefit of this proposal is that it would provide safety to the children while spending time with [mr cygnis] particularly in relation to any emotional vulnerability [mr cygnis] may experience. maintaining the status quo would likely provide the children with stability in that there would not be an adjustment to their time spending arrangements. a disadvantage of this proposal is that it limits the children’s time with [mr cygnis], which is not in alignment with the children’s wishes, it may limit the children’s ability to develop a meaningful relationship with [mr cygnis], and it minimises the likelihood of the children having [mr cygnis] actively involved in their everyday lives. [mr cygnis’] proposal that the children spend unsupervised time with him for up to one full day each alternate weekend in addition to three to four hours, after-school each week seems to be based on [mr cygnis’] view that he does not pose a risk to the children’s emotional or physical safety. in addition, [mr cygnis] wants to have meaningful involvement in the children’s lives including attending extra-curricular activities and completing homework. [mr cygnis] appeared to have insight into the children’s needs by recognising it may not be in their best interests for them to spend time with him each weekend due to their other commitments. a benefit of [mr cygnis’] proposal is that it will likely allow the children and [mr cygnis] to have increased meaningful interactions either at his home or in the community without the limitations of supervision. in addition, it will allow the children to have [mr cygnis] actively involved in their everyday lives, including attending their extracurricular activities, which appear to be important to the children. [mr cygnis] is likely able to contribute to the children’s growth, development and wellbeing by spending regular, predictable and quality time with the children. a disadvantage of [mr cygnis’] proposal is that, if [ms cygnis’] allegations and [dr f]’s concerns are true, the children’s emotional and physical safety could be at risk if they were to spend unsupervised time with [mr cygnis]. a further disadvantage of [mr cygnis’] proposal is that it does not mirror the children’s views. [x] is entering adolescence and his developmental priorities are for him to have a safe and stable home environment, gradually increased age appropriate autonomy in relationships, a meaningful relationship with both parents (if safe to do so) and parental support to pursue his own interests and values as he progresses towards adulthood. [y]’s developmental priorities are for her to have a safe and home environment, a meaningful relationship with both parents (if safe to do so) and the opportunity to attend activities, which encourage her to develop friendships. both children need protection from the parental conflict so they can enjoy being children and meet their developmental milestones. both children appear to be children who value structure, rules and boundaries. irrespective of what the court decides regarding the time spending arrangements for the children, the children may benefit from knowing what behaviours from [mr cygnis] are acceptable and unacceptable. it may be reassuring for the children and contribute to a sense of safety for them to have an agreement from [mr cygnis] that he abide by the expectations of his conduct. if [mr cygnis] were to stray from his commitment to maintain appropriate conduct in front of the children, it may damage the children’s relationship with [mr cygnis]. the parents and children’s respective psychologists may be able to assist in setting expectations in a child-friendly manner. as the children mature, they will likely exercise their own discretion about the time they wish to spend with [mr cygnis]. the children’s discretion will be based on factors including: the strength of their relationship with [mr cygnis], their perception of [mr cygnis], and their other commitments, such as education, employment and friendships. as the children develop, it is important that both parents respect the children’s views about the time they wish to spend with their parents. if the children’s views are not respected, it may negatively affect their relationships with their parents and cause the children an increased level of stress and anxiety, which in turn may affect their ability to sleep, their schooling, peer relationships and their progress towards their developmental milestones. overall, if [mr cygnis] does not have additional mental health diagnoses, it appears that [x] and [y]’s needs will be best met by spending increased time with [mr cygnis] via a staged approach that leads to unsupervised time. given the concerns held by [mr cygnis] and [dr f], it is likely best for the children that their time spending arrangements with [mr cygnis] do not increase during the school holidays given the children will not have access to their school who can provide additional oversight. if a psychiatric assessment of [mr cygnis] finds an additional mental health diagnosis, the court may benefit from following the recommendations of the assessor in order to determine the time spending arrangements for the children based on the suggested treatment, prognosis and effect on [mr cygnis’] parenting capacity. based on the children’s wishes and the reports from both parents that phone calls between [mr cygnis] and the children are generally enjoyable for the children, the children should be able to speak with [mr cygnis], via telephone, up to three times per week. it is important that the children’s wishes guide the duration of the calls as it is not realistic to expect the children to speak to [mr cygnis] for the same length of time, on every occasion. if both parents cannot agree on important decisions for the children, it may be beneficial for the children that [ms cygnis] is able to finalise a decision and communicate this decision to [mr cygnis]. recommendations unless evidence suggests otherwise, it is respectfully recommended that, the court orders [mr cygnis] to undertake an updated psychiatric assessment. both parents attend a parenting course aimed at adolescents such as [c program] provided by [t centre] or [z course], which can be completed online. in addition, [mr cygnis] attend a parenting course aimed at developing alternative strategies to physical discipline, such as [aa program], or [bb program]. after the completion of recommendations 142 and 143, [x] and [y] spend increased time with [mr cygnis] via a staged approach, which should only progress once [mr cygnis] has consistently attended in a timely fashion with no concerns raised by the children. a suggested approach is as follows: the children spend time with [mr cygnis] through the [b contact centre] supervised contact program for two visits on alternate saturdays for two hours. if the court determine that [ms p] is an appropriate person to supervise time with the children, the children should be introduced to [ms p] while [mr cygnis] is spending time with the children at [b contact centre]. after two consecutive visits at [b contact centre], [mr cygnis] can spend additional time with the children after-school, unsupervised in the community, for one afternoon in the “off” week to enable [mr cygnis] to support the children to attend their extracurricular activities. after two months, [mr cygnis] can progress to, week one: unsupervised time with the children each alternate saturday for four hours in the community and, week two: unsupervised time with the children after-school, in the community, to support the children to attend their extracurricular activities and to have dinner together. after two months, the children’s time with [mr cygnis] can progress to unsupervised time each alternate saturday for eight hours and unsupervised time with the children after-school as per part c. once [mr cygnis] is spending unsupervised time with the children for eight hours, [mr cygnis] advises [ms cygnis] of where he will be spending time with the children 24 hours prior. commencing immediately, the children speak with [mr cygnis] via telephone up to three days per week, with the duration determined by the children. changeovers occur in a public place in a manner that limits interactions between [ms cygnis] and [mr cygnis]. [ms cygnis], [mr cygnis], [x] and [y] continue to seek support from their respective psychologists. the parties consider seeking advice from their psychologists to develop a plan that outlines expectations about the conduct of [mr cygnis] when he is with the children. it may be reassuring for the children to have an agreement from [mr cygnis] that he will follow the agreed plan. both parents are restrained from physically disciplining the children. both parents are restrained from speaking negatively about the other parent in the presence of the children.

written submissions on behalf of the applicant
background [ms cygnis] (applicant mother) and [mr cygnis] (respondent father) are the parents of [x] born [in] 2011 and [y] born [in] 2015 (the children) the respondent mother seeks final parenting orders in accordance with the minute of orders sought filed 3 august 2020. orders sought the mother seeks orders for sole parental responsibility, orders that the children live with her, and that the children spend time with the father: initially supervised by professional contact service for four hours on saturday in week one and afterschool for one afternoon in week two. upon completion of the men’s behaviour change program and parenting courses ([z program] parenting course and [aa program] or [bb program], the mother propose the time progresses to unsupervised time in a public place initially on each alternate saturday from 9am –11am (10 visits) and eventually progressing to 9am to 3pm on saturday in week one in a public place and after school wednesday in week two. the mother seeks orders in relation to special occasions and school holidays as outlined in the minute and seeks injunctive orders and ancillary orders. the mother seeks orders requiring the father to pay her nonperiodic child‑support for the children’s school fees and half the fees for the children’s psychologist. the father seeks orders for the mother to have sole parental responsibility with consultation, for the children to live with the mother and for the children spend time with him initially supervised at a professional contact service for a period of four visits each alternate saturday, and following that there is a proposal for progression of time ultimately resulting in a proposal by the father for the children to spend time with him unsupervised and during daytime only. the court is therefore required to determine the spend time with arrangements for the father, and what, if any steps are required to be taken by the father before that progresses to unsupervised time, and the extent and nature of that unsupervised time. it is noted that none of the parties, including independent children’s lawyer seeks the father have overnight time with the children, and this is a change in the position of the father and the independent children’s lawyer since the completion of the trial. it is submitted on behalf of the mother as follows: unacceptable risk of harm the court should find that there is an unacceptable risk of harm to the children in the care of the father. the risks alleged by the mother are: risk of psychological harm due to exposure to the father’s paranoid and extremist beliefs. risk of psychological harm, due to the father’s mental health condition, and how this impacts his communication and relationships. risk of physical harm to the children. risk of exposure to family violence. risk of neglect. the standard of proof in relation to any finding of unacceptable risk is the possibility of the risk occurring and is not limited to findings of past facts. father’s mental health the father ‘s mental health diagnosis was in issue at the trial. the current diagnosis, as reported by the father is autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. the father had previously been diagnosed with level three autism spectrum disorder by his treating psychologist, but this was later identified by the court appointed expert, [dr e] as being more appropriate to be a level one diagnosis. [dr e] in his oral evidence to the court during the trial indicated that the father may have a delusional disorder, and that the father would be unlikely to seek treatment for that disorder as people with such a disorder are typically “non-compliant”. prior to this, psychologist court appointed expert [dr f] postulated in her report dated 7 january 2022 that the father may suffer from [a medical disorder]. in a joint report repaired for the court by the experts before trial, it was agreed that “consideration was given to the possibility of [mr cygnis] having an underlying personality disorder[...]. this was considered possible. this would explain his longstanding paranoid preoccupations and interpersonal behavioural difficulties.” [dr e] in his evidence said the father lacked empathy and his behaviours were similar to those with a “narcissistic paranoid personality type structure.” the father’s presentation in the witness box would be a concern to the court. he presented with a fixed belief that he was the victim of abuse by the mother. the father was of the view that the mother had ticked every circle of the abuse wheel in relation to himself as a victim, and felt she was the perpetrator. [dr e] identified that the father would not shift from that belief. the father’s communication style would cause challenges for the children, and this is demonstrated by his evidence and exchanges in the witness box with the court and counsel. the father held fixated beliefs and had expressed extremist views on [social media]. the father was asked to identify which of the [social media] post that he had been the author of in relation to threats to politicians and abusive language. he failed to do that before the conclusion of the trial, despite multiple inquiries. it is on behalf of the mother in those circumstances, the court could find that the father is the author of the [social media] post that appear at paragraph 192 of the mother‘s affidavit filed 12 july 2023. [dr e] stated in his evidence that ‘episodic catastrophic reactions’ of the father were less likely to occur to expose the children to risk if the time occurred in public places. this supports the mother’s application that the children spend time with the father in public places once the time moves from a contact centre. the mother presented as a credible witness, and the court should accept her evidence. the father made allegations of being a victim of physical violence from the mother, the mother denies these incidents occurred. the father maintains the mother had post-natal depression/psychosis and raised concerns about what she may do to the children if the court proceedings did not go her way. there is no evidence the mother has been diagnosed with these conditions. it should concern the court that the father may not be truthful, and the court should accept the mother’s evidence when there is a conflict between the reports of the parties as to incidents. when determining the issue of risk, the most compelling evidence for the court, will be the evidence from [dr e] and [dr f]. the father showed limited insight into his own mental health condition and its impact on the children and the mother. there is evidence that [x] has returned from a period of an unsupervised visit with the father, upset and distressed. it is submitted that it is not appropriate for the children to have to self report on their father and manage his mental health and that it is an unnecessary burden on the children. the father gave evidence that he had read a document [...] regarding family law courts. he had told [dr f] that the mother’s allegations that she had been sexually abused by the father that she had “completely fabricated the claims” and it “is a normal allegation for women to make in family court because it forces the game against the man”. family violence the mother deposes to being the victim of sexual abuse, emotional abuse, verbal abuse and coercive controlling behaviours by the husband. the mother deposes to being subjected to the father's ranting especially in relation to political issues. the mother deposes to the father smacking the children and in response the father says “the bible says we must smack them.” the mother deposes to the father saying to her the children need to be physically disciplined and smacked. when she disagreed he said to her “you're being a feminist the bible says we have to smack them.” there is a legitimate concern of the mother that the children will be subjected to physical discipline or physical abuse in the unsupervised care of the father if that time occurred in a non-public place. the mother deposes to an incident where [x] in 2017 was trying to get his father's attention and said his father was agitated about political news and alleges the father grabbed the [object] and made a stabbing motion towards [x]’s face whilst making a growling sound. this caused [x] to scream “daddy is trying to stab me.” the mother further says the father sent her messages [in early] 2019 with the father made comments about hanging traitors “is perfectly rational and the law”. further the mother says on [social media] the father was banned after making threatening comments and expressing extremist views including in relation to [attacking people], asking if [...] wants the [weapons], [posting to politicians] about [their personal affairs] and his concerns about the government. [dr f]’s comprehensive report raised serious concerns about the father and his “dysregulated, aggressive and at times abusive behaviour towards others that has been frightening to the mother and to [x]”. [dr f] was of the view that [mr cygnis] poses “some risk to the children due to a function of his poor mental health and proclivity to dysregulation and in relation to his capacity to regulate given his strong and fixed negative views about [ms cygnis].” child support the children have been attending [r school] by agreement between the parties. the father previously shared equally the school fees with the mother and the fees are as outlined in paragraph 106 of the mother’s affidavit filed 12 july 2023 and annexure h. the mother says at paragraph 107 in march 2019, the father stopped contributing and she seeks an order that he pay half of the fees. both children attend on psychologists and the mother seeks an order the father pay half those costs. the mother deposes in her affidavit sworn 12 july 2023 at paragraphs 121-128 in relation to [x]’s mental health needs and paragraphs 121-154 as to [y]’s mental health needs. whilst the mother did not make any application for a departure order, it is submitted the court has the power to make these orders under s124 and 141 of the child support assessment act 1989 as occurred in the recent case of simiko & kellidis (no 2) [2022] fedcfamc2f 982 (28 july 2022). the evidence of the current assessment is at paragraph 104 of the mother’s affidavit filed 12 july 2023. the court can be satisfied that it is just and equitable and proper (s124(1) child support assessment act 1989) in the circumstances to make such an order as the father previously agreed to the children attending the school and paid half the costs. the need for the children to attend counselling/mental heath treaters is due to their exposure to the father’s mental health condition. in accordance with section 125 of the child support assessment act 1989, the court would be satisfied that it is not just and equitable for the assessed amount of child support to be reduced due to any payments ordered by the court. the mother works part time and is the sole carer for the children and will continue to be so on both parties’ applications. the father gave evidence about his full time employment. the mother says the father is in arrears in his assessed child support payments. parental responsibility the court would be satisfied the presumption does not apply in relation to parental responsibility (s61da) and both parents agree the mother should have sole parental responsibility. best interests – primary considerations meaningful relationship (section 60cc(2)(a) of the family law act) prima facie, and absent risk, there is presumed benefit to the children having a relationship with each parent. both parents have a meaningful relationship with the children. the need to protect the children from harm (section 60cc(2)(b) of the family law act) the mother submits the children are at risk psychological and physical harm if they were to be in the unsupervised care of the father and that time was not occurring a public place. the mother was clear in her evidence that her concerns about the father’s mental health and lack of diagnosis are as that she was “...hoping that there is further investigation into whatever it is that causes him to operate in a paranoid and delusional way, resulting in violence towards myself and the children, and to minimise that occurring to them, or them being left to manage an outburst that is unsafe for them.” these are the risks of harm identified by the mother and it is submitted these risks are valid concerns supported by the experts [dr e] and [dr f] in their evidence. the mother submits the children are at risk of expose to family violence and neglect. best interests – additional considerations child’s views – 60cc(3)(a) [x] expressed to [dr e] he “did feel unsafe living with the father at times and referred to him “shouting and screaming” and “threatening to do stuff”. [x] expressed to the family consultant that he said his time with his father should remain supervised as “when we see dad unsupervised, dad said something bad about mum” [y] told [dr f] that she would like to see her father every second saturday, nature of relationships – s 60cc (3)(b) the children live with the mother and she has been the primary carer – it is submitted that the children have a close and meaningful relationship with both parents. parental engagement – s 60cc(3)(c), (ca) the mother is responsible for the care of the children and their schooling and educational needs and medical needs. effect of change in circumstances – s 60cc(3)(d) there is no significant change in circumstances in the mother’s proposal as the children will remain living with her. there is additional time proposed for the father. practical difficulty and expense -s60cc(3)(e) there is no practical difficulty or expense of the children spending time with and communicating with either parent if the mother’s proposal is accepted. parental capacity – s 60cc(3)(f) it is submitted that the father has capacity to make a much more significant financial contribution to the care of the children than he has currently done. the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents – s 60cc(3)(i) it is submitted that the mother has demonstrated that she is committed to the care and well-being of the children. the father’s cessation of financial contribution to the children’s school fees and medical needs has created difficulties for the mother and is not reflective of the father demonstrating responsibility for parenthood. other relevant issues the court would find the mother was a truthful witness – she was clearly focused on the children and their needs. the father’s demeanour was combative and his communication style strident, fixed and defensive. conclusion the children clearly have a meaningful relationship with both their parents and the mother seeks orders that would allow that to continue in a safe way, protective of the children.

reliability of evidence/credibility in this matter more than most the opinion of expert witnesses was dependent on the reliably of the information they were provided with. in the joint expert report dated 25 july 2023 [dr e] and [dr f] stated:
it was evident that [dr e] had given greater weight to the history obtained from [mr cygnis], whilst [dr f] had considered [ms cygnis], who was not interviewed by [dr e], to be likely to be the more reliable historian.
it is submitted that the reliability of the mother as a historian is not as watertight as she asserts or [dr f] assumed in her report. this was most significant in the mother’s recollection of events where father and [x] travelled to sydney in [early] 2019 where the description of the events in the mother’s trial affidavit and the nature of her expressed concerns, was at complete odds with the messaging communications between the parents on the day of the trip. under cross-examination the mother changed the focus of her concerns from those espoused in her affidavit and why she was providing such evidence to the court. it is submitted that the court would find she was misleading in her affidavit evidence concerning that event, at least by way of omission of relevant evidence. the same inaccuracies in recollection, omissions or recording of history was evident in much of the mother’s evidence, including, but not limited to: a) she initially denied the father regularly cared for the children alone during the relationship saying – “not regularly”. it was put to her that the father cared for [x] most mondays for “several years” and she denied that proposition. she eventually conceded that he cared for [x] alone mondays regularly saying “it was a couple –over – across a couple of years “. b) in her affidavit the mother refers to sexual abuse “throughout our entire relationship” and proceeds to describe a pattern of all invasive sexual abuse where the flavour of the evidence is indicative of an intent to show sexual abuse was the norm in the relationship. tendered text messages, and cross-examination of the mother suggested, to the contrary, that there was a healthy sexual relationship where the mother was the instigator of sexually suggestive communications throughout the relationship and as recently as a month before separation. while it would never be suggested by the author that an indication of positive sexual relationship means sexual abuse cannot occur, in the circumstances of this matter the nature of the text communications between the parties are completely at odds with the mother’s affidavit material which in no way indicates any positive sexual relationship between the parties. c) in her affidavit the mother asserts that the father did not request to see the children over an 8 week period in december/january 2020/21. the evidence of both the father and his sister [ms j] showed that he did in fact request time but it was declined for the day requested. d) in her affidavit and in oral evidence the mother denied speaking negatively to the children about their father or discussing the proceedings with them. the record of conversation between [dr f] and [y] at paragraphs 198 and 200 of her report suggests very much to the contrary. [dr e] in his evidence agreed [y]’s statements showed she was not recording her own thoughts but things that she has been told. the vast majority of the mother’s evidence of concerning behaviour from the father was from during the relationship or immediately post separation. in fact, to her credit, the mother acknowledged that she had only highlighted two events of concern since 2020 in her material, these being the school incident of [late] 2022 and [y]’s birthday in 2022. she agreed that the reports of [b contact centre]’s supervised time was for the last 2 years was “universally positive” regarding the “school event of [late] 2022”, it was the mother’s evidence that [x] was scared because his father attended the school. that evidence is inconsistent with what is contained in the notes of [x]’s counsellor who makes no record of [x] saying he was scared but rather [x] saying he was angry and upset and having to leave an enjoyable activity in his class. in cross‑examination the mother deflected questions and made excuses before eventually conceding that her actions may have sent a signal to [x] that his father is person to be feared. it is not suggested that the mother’s concerns, or anxiety, is not real nor that there are no issues of concern with the father. the father himself readily acknowledged areas of difficulties in his behaviours. rather, it is submitted that in expressing her concerns the mother has embellished, reconstrued facts, omitted relevant information and context and cherrypicked partial information in order to present a narrative of concern that is elevated above that of reality. consequently, the reliability of the mother’s narrative and her level of professed blamelessness is seriously questionable. the father the court would appropriately find that in giving his evidence the father his own words, “overshared quite a bit”, was argumentative and accusatory. he acknowledged he maintained concerns about the mother and safety to the children in her care. he acknowledged that he continued to maintain non‑mainstream beliefs in certain political and religious/moral areas. the court would not find however that the father was anything other than honest in his evidence and he readily acknowledged where he had erred. on multiple occasions when asked to adopt a series of propositions he denied some but conceded others even where his conceding in no way assisted his case. his honesty in accepting negative propositions to the detriment of his case, it is submitted, gives the court a greater ability to accept his credibility and therefore the reliability of his evidence generally. the mother’s concerns it is submitted that the mother is highly anxious about the time the children spend with the father. it is not disputed that her anxiety is anything other than genuine. however, while the mother’s anxiety may be genuine, the evidence does not support the level of expressed concern displayed by the mother. the mother’s anxiety is such that she catastrophises any distress displayed by the children concerning the father, particularly [x], construes it negatively towards the father and ascribes blame to the father, even where [x] specifically says otherwise. [dr f] agreed that the mother’s anxiety itself could have a negative impact on the wellbeing of the children. the degree of focus of the mother on not being “blamed” for consequences of the situation she seeks to create, (by way of her orders sought), was quite extraordinary. it is understandable that the mother would be concerned that the children may hold her responsible for not having a meaningful relationship with their father in the future given the orders she seeks. a significant preoccupation on the part of the mother was deflecting this responsibility from herself. expert evidence it is not proposed to consider the expert evidence in detail in these submissions other than to acknowledge that [dr e] and [dr f] differed on their diagnosis of the father and they each maintained their respective position during their oral evidence. it is submitted that rather than what the experts disagreed upon, what is of much greater importance for the considerations of the court was that all the expert witnesses agreed that the label that was given to the father was not so important but rather the importance was the father’s behaviour, the risk that behaviour posed to the children and his ability to regulate his behaviour during future time with the children. in this regard [dr f] stated:
a) she initially denied the father regularly cared for the children alone during the relationship saying – “not regularly”. it was put to her that the father cared for [x] most mondays for “several years” and she denied that proposition. she eventually conceded that he cared for [x] alone mondays regularly saying “it was a couple –over – across a couple of years “. b) in her affidavit the mother refers to sexual abuse “throughout our entire relationship” and proceeds to describe a pattern of all invasive sexual abuse where the flavour of the evidence is indicative of an intent to show sexual abuse was the norm in the relationship. tendered text messages, and cross-examination of the mother suggested, to the contrary, that there was a healthy sexual relationship where the mother was the instigator of sexually suggestive communications throughout the relationship and as recently as a month before separation. while it would never be suggested by the author that an indication of positive sexual relationship means sexual abuse cannot occur, in the circumstances of this matter the nature of the text communications between the parties are completely at odds with the mother’s affidavit material which in no way indicates any positive sexual relationship between the parties. c) in her affidavit the mother asserts that the father did not request to see the children over an 8 week period in december/january 2020/21. the evidence of both the father and his sister [ms j] showed that he did in fact request time but it was declined for the day requested. d) in her affidavit and in oral evidence the mother denied speaking negatively to the children about their father or discussing the proceedings with them. the record of conversation between [dr f] and [y] at paragraphs 198 and 200 of her report suggests very much to the contrary.

in relation to the risk to the children, again if i go back to what i said before to his honour, which is i think my advice to the court would be if we don’t worry so much about labels, but actually look at behaviour, right. in this case we have again consistent long-standing evidence of patterns of behaviour that in my view expose the children to risk. you asked me what is that risk. that risk is predominantly the psychological harm through ranting, raving, making negative comments and disparaging comments about the mother. both [dr e] and [ms g] generally agreed with this view. similarly, all 3 experts agreed that if the court accepted that the father had engaged appropriately in therapy, had changed his behaviour that was of concern over the last couple of years and had behaved appropriately in supervised time with the children, it would be reassuring and indicative that the father could be able to control or regulate his behaviour during future and unsupervised time with the children.
the father’s position in his oral evidence the father demonstrated compellingly that he understood how his behaviour had could impact negatively on the children if they were exposed to dysregulated behaviour. notwithstanding that the father may continue to hold non-mainstream political and religious/ moral beliefs, as well as beliefs about the mother’s past actions which are at odds with those of the mother, he was very clear that he understood it would not be appropriate to discuss such matters with the children or in front of them. this was perhaps best illustrated in cross-examination by the icl where he firstly confirmed he held certain beliefs about the mother’s actions and risk to the children from her but was then asked the following:  ] you think that would be – it would be appropriate to say in the presence of the children?---no, because that’s talking about adult matters and to do with these court proceedings. now, even in the absence of court orders preventing me from speaking to the children about the matter, i – it’s just not appropriate to be discussing it in front of the children. and nor, given all the opportunities that i have been given to do that, and particularly being with my son on one occasion goading me regarding this, on actually more than one occasion, that i have not gone and done that. the icl then went on to question the father in detail about beliefs he held about the mother and her actions where the father repeatedly and systematically identified that he would not express such matters to the children and explained why it would be inappropriate to do so. similarly, the father was able to explain detailed measures he had taken to limit exposure to online triggering events and unhelpful content regarding political and other matters. both children have consistently expressed that they want more time with their father and time to be away from [b contact centre]. [x] is now of an age where he can, and likely will, report if anything untoward that happens when spending time with his father. he continues to attend counselling regularly and it is therefore likely that if the father behaves in an unregulated manner [x] will tell someone. it is submitted however that the court would not entrust solely to the mother any decision to suspend time between the children and their father. in this regard the court would place some significance on the evidence of [dr f] that, [x’s] anxious and so he probably worries about things that he doesn’t need to worry about that may never have happened or that may have happened five years ago that he remembers and still worries about. so i think we need to take some of those anxieties with a grain of salt is what i’m saying. the orders sought by the father are in line with the recommendations made by [ms g] and provide for a graduated increase in time and reduction of supervision. in most regards the orders proposed by the father align with those sought by the icl, at least up until introduction of some overnight time. the icl put the proposal of increasing time and moving away from supervision to [dr f] who endorsed the proposed orders, [ms g] maintained her views and recommendations, [dr e] was not specifically asked about the proposed orders but maintained his view that the children are not a physical risk from the father and was generally supportive of increased time and move away from supervision. the father’s orders sought differ from those sought by the icl in that the father seeks some limited overnight time in school holidays to commence in the 2024-25 summer school holidays. the basis for this is that it would enable the children to do a greater range of “normal” activities such as an overnight holiday away. while each of the experts were asked about introduction of overnight time, it is submitted none provided any compelling reason why it would not be in the best interests of the children for it to occur, rather, that the issue was still the father’s ability to regulate his behaviour. given it is not proposed to commence any overnight time until the end of 2024, there will be considerable time to confirm the father’s appropriate behaviours prior to proposed overnight time commencing. the father also proposes orders for family therapy with the children specifically focused on assisting the children to understand the father’s “peculiarities” and build resilience as time increases. this proposal was supported by the mother and [ms g]. this therapy would necessarily be additional to the children’s, and indeed the father’s, personal counselling which meet very different needs.
other matters it is noted that in her minute of orders sought dated 28 july 2023 the mother sought orders for payment of school fees and other expenses which, in effect would amount to a departure order from the assessment of child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989. this was raised briefly in the hearing but not otherwise pursued by the mother during the hearing. it was not clarified during the proceedings whether the mother was pursuing such orders and nothing further about what orders may be sought was raised. in her updated minute of orders sought dated 3 august 2023 the mother apparently seeks specific orders to be made under the child support (assessment) act 1989. it is submitted generally that the orders sought are misguided, even if the court had the legislative jurisdiction to make the orders in the circumstances of these proceedings which it is submitted it does not. any departure from the usual assessment of child support is complex and should not be considered by way of an “add on” to amended order sought at conclusion of evidence. should the court consider making the financial orders sought by the mother, the father would seek leave to make more detailed submissions in response to any order sought by the mother.

outline of principle
... maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents, obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement having been incurred.
... it must not be assumed that one parent (the father) cannot move and that the mother must, in every case, subordinate her ambitions and wishes, not to the needs of the child, but to the wishes of the father to pursue his life in a place of his choosing. it is the interests of the child which are paramount, not the interests or needs of the parents, let alone the interests of one of them.  4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. "[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms." because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be "best" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing.
on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.” on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.   the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(2))  ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s 60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues:
the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility.  ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words “meaningful involvement”. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting:
the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements.  ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]–[199]):  6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) — (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than “1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays” or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve “both” parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children.  ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system”. “meaning” is defined as “having intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)”. a second definition is “conveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive”. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines “meaning” (in generalised use) as “significance”. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as “full of meaning, significant”. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as “expressive or significant: a meaning look”. [26] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
i am conscious that a long-distance relationship, with longer but less frequent times spent together, is inevitably different from a relationship where people live closer together with regular face-to-face contact. but it does not itself mean it cannot be meaningful.
we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o’ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]:
the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a “meaningful relationship” with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court’s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child’s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider “the benefit to the child” of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j’s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original)
the full court also observed at [191]: “the first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression ‘meaningful relationship’ is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a ‘meaningful relationship’ ”.  7] for our part, we echo the view expressed by the trial judge of the serious nature of depriving the father of contact in circumstances where that appears to have been engineered by the mother, without any fault on the part of the father at all. this cannot be in a child's best interests. [178] it also does not appear to us to be appropriate for a parent to be able to manipulate the family law system to such an extent that the other parent's hope of ever seeing the child again, rests upon the possibility that she may wish to seek him out in later adolescence or adulthood. [179] we think that a family court would not be doing its duty if it were to simply give in to these sorts of considerations, except in the most extreme case and only then, when a positive determination is made that the welfare of the child requires it.
given the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the court must consider the conduct of the parents, not with a view to rewarding one or punishing the other, but to ascertain from such conduct whether the welfare of the child will be better served in the custody of one or the other.
