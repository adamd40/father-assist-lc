standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.

preliminary issues
preliminary issue 1: should the withdrawal from available mortgage funds and the value of items disposed of by the wife be added back to the joint asset pool?
totalling $33,650 approx
law regarding add-backs
marriage is for most couples an economic partnership. married couples live together and work together with the ultimate object of purchasing a home, paying it off, acquiring other assets with the overall object of attaining a higher standard of living. the reported decisions in respect of applications for settlement of property under sec. 79 of the act are unanimous hat both parties should share the economic fruits of a marriage, having regard to the provisions of sec. 79(4) and sec. 75(2), although not necessarily equally.[121]   where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm (1998) flc 92—816 the full court said at 85,262: for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend (1995) flc 92—569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,704:   where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend (1995) flc 92—569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,704:
in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the respondent did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the applicant had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the respondent as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the respondent has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the respondent’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly. (c) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw (1981) flc 91—092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[126]   in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw (1981) flc 91—092 at 76,644:   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[126]   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[126]

legal principles — property proceedings under parts viii and viiiab and the approach in hickey and stanford  identify the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, liabilities, and financial resources at the time of trial, and then determine whether it is just and equitable to adjust their interests pursuant to s 79(2) or s 90sm(3),[147] (2) consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)-(c) or s 90sm(4)(a)-(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)-(g) or s 90sm(4)(d)-(g), including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e) or s 90sm(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) or s 90sf(3) insofar as they are relevant,[148] and then (4) ‘stand-back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[149]   consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)-(c) or s 90sm(4)(a)-(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)-(g) or s 90sm(4)(d)-(g), including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e) or s 90sm(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) or s 90sf(3) insofar as they are relevant,[148] and then (4) ‘stand-back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[149]   consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)-(g) or s 90sm(4)(d)-(g), including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e) or s 90sm(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) or s 90sf(3) insofar as they are relevant,[148] and then (4) ‘stand-back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[149]   ‘stand-back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[149]
by reference to the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, is it just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 90sm?
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).
the parties' positions based on the asset pool as determined.
section 90sm(4)(a)-(c) — contributions
section 90sm(4)(a) — direct or indirect financial contributions to property
the approach adopted by the parties before her honour is repeated in the supplementary submissions filed on behalf of the respondent, it is there asserted that “the contributions of the parties would be equal aside from gifting by the respondent’s father of significant parcels of land which remain in existence at the present point in time”. counsel for the applicant, in his further submissions, makes no such specific assertion but implicitly does so by relying upon the trial judge’s findings and manner of assessment. for the reasons given earlier, we reject that approach, the gifts by the respondent’s father should be taken into account as a contribution together with the miscellany of other contributions made by each of the parties over the course of their marriage.[159]
yet, that approach must also ensure that the “myriad of other contributions” and the duration over which, and circumstances in which, the miscellany of other s 79(4) contributions were made is not accorded a subsidiary role. the essential s 79(4) task is for “trial judges [to] weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation.[160]
as can be sees the primary judge weighed the myriad contributions made by the parties against the contribution made by the respondent in bringing in property a rather than treating property a as one of the myriad contributions made.[161]
...it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. (emphasis added) to similar effect, in cabbell & cabbell [2009] famcafc 205, the full court stated at [54] that in considering the parties’ contributions, it is necessary to trace the use of those assets and consider the foundation that they laid for the subsequent accumulation of wealth by the parties. that is, in evaluating the parties’ contributions, it was necessary for the primary judge to have regard to the context of the husband’s initial contribution and specifically, to the opportunity that initial contribution created and the impact of that initial contribution on the subsequent wealth of the parties as at the date of the hearing. (emphasis added)
section 90sm(4)(b) — direct or indirect non—financial contributions to property
section 90sm(4)(c) — contributions to the welfare of the family, including contributions as homemaker or parent
conclusion regarding the parties’ contributions
section 90sm(4)(d)—(g), including s 90sf(3) — other factors t is the financial consequences of all of the relevant matters that are to be taken into account and the section is so drafted to effect this purpose while excluding matters of conduct in a moral or non-financial sense.[172]
section 90sm(4)(d) – the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the de facto relationship
section 90sm(4)(e) – the matters referred to in subsection 90sf(3) so far as they are relevant
section 90sf(3)(a) — the age and state of health of each of the parties
section 90sf(3)(b) — the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment
it has long been recognised that in most cases the most valuable “asset” which a party can take out of the marriage is a substantial, reliable, income—earning capacity: see best and best (1993) flc 92—418 at 80,305.[178]
in addition, it should not be forgotten that the payment of child support in no way compensates the custodial parent for the loss of career opportunity, lack of employment mobility and the restriction on an independent lifestyle which the obligation to care for children usually entails see langford (16 january, 1995, full court, not reported).[179]
section 90sf(3)(c) — whether either party has the care or control of a child of the de facto relationship who has not attained the age of 18 years

section 90sf(3)(f) —the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under any law or superannuation fund, and the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party
section 90sf(3)(g) — a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable
section 90sf(3)(h) — the extent to which a party’s earning capacity could be increased by enabling them to undertake a course of education or training or to establish themselves in a business or otherwise to obtain an adequate income
section 90sf(3)(j) — the extent to which a party has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other party
section 90sf(3)(k) — the duration of the de facto relationship and the extent to which it has affected the earning capacity of each party
section 90sf(3)(l) — the need to protect a party who wished to continue that party’s role as a parent
section 90sf(3)(m) — if either party is cohabiting with another person—the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation
section 90sf(3)(n) — the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 90sm in relation to the property of the parties
section 90sf(3)(o) — the terms of any order or declaration made, or proposed to be made, under this part in relation to a party (in relation to another de facto relationship), persons in that other de facto relationship, or the property or vested bankruptcy property thereof
section 90sf(3)(p) — the terms of any order or declaration made, or proposed to be made, under part viii in relation to a party, persons in a marriage with the first—mentioned party, or the property or vested bankruptcy property thereof
section 90sf(3)(q) — any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the de facto relationship has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the de facto relationship

section 90sm(4)(g) — any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the de facto relationship has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the de facto relationship
conclusion regarding the matters referred to in s 90sm(4)(d)—(g)
conclusion regarding the overall division of the parties' net assets
what is the just and equitable exercise of discretion?
... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s. 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[199]
a. the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, b. whether any party has legal aid and the terms of any grant of aid, the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answers, questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and g. such other matters as the court considers relevant.
9. section 117(3) provides: to avoid doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children’s lawyer in respect of the proceedings. 10. section 117(4) provides: however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if: a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,
the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children's lawyer.
11. section 117(5) provides: in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2) in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer has been appointed, the court must disregard the fact that the independent children’s lawyer is funded under a legal aid scheme or service established under a commonwealth, state or territory law or approved by the attorney-general. a question arises as to the actual meaning of the legislative intent for the court to “disregard the legal aid funding” of the independent children’s lawyer, because that terminology is susceptible to ambiguity. as opined by austin j in gahen & gahen (no 2) [2013] famca 936, it could conceivably mean either: the independent children's lawyer should be presumed to be unfunded, so as to generally incline the court to order the parties’ contribution to the independent children's lawyer’s costs, or the court should not be swayed by either the presumed ampleness or scarcity of the independent children's lawyer’s legal aid funding when determining whether to order the parties’ contribution to the independent children’s lawyer’s costs. in de roma & de roma [2013] famca 566 watts j explained why the former is the preferred connotation, since the purposes of the legislative provision was to protect the public purse. the threshold presumption as to each party bearing their own costs has no application to the independent children’s lawyer, who is not a party. the law is well settled, however, that there is power under the section, subject to other statutory provisions referred to below, to make orders for or against the independent children’s lawyer and the court may make such order as to costs of the independent children’s lawyer and in such proportions in relation to each of the parties as the court considers just: (de roma & de roma (supra)).[201]
