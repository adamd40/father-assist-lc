applicant’s evidence as to contributions  the certification of the accounting process contained in the document amounts to expert evidence where there had been no prior indication that the applicant would rely on expert evidence and no compliance with part 7.1 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 (cth) in respect of appointment of an expert or the form of the evidence that the expert would give, and (b) the certification on the document by mr k contains a statement that he cannot certify the validity of the source numbers in the document, only the validity of the accounting processes employed. the validity of the source numbers is important in establishing the relative contributions of the parties in these proceedings, and so the document cannot assist the court in this task.   the certification on the document by mr k contains a statement that he cannot certify the validity of the source numbers in the document, only the validity of the accounting processes employed. the validity of the source numbers is important in establishing the relative contributions of the parties in these proceedings, and so the document cannot assist the court in this task.

method/approach of the applicant  they attribute values to contributions based on evidence not before the court. for example, the document lists days or hours attributed to certain activities which are then multiplied by hourly rates, but the number of hours and the rates are not the subject of probative evidence. instead, it relies on statistics or an estimate or appraisal made by the applicant about which he did not give evidence, (b) they apportioned contributions on the basis of a moral agreement into which he claimed the parties entered about their approach to the relationship, with which he asserts the respondent did not comply. for example, the respondent is only attributed 20 per cent for housework because he says that she should only have done one fifth and not more, (c) in some cases, the applicant uses commercial rates in the united states to value the contribution of a task, when there is no rational relationship between those rates and australia or the nature of the assessment of contributions in proceedings pursuant to s 79 of the act, (d) they treat differences of opinion about what should be expended on education of the children as a negative or wasteful contribution, (e) they purport to create a post-separation rent debt owed by the respondent to the applicant calculated in commercial terms, and which simply is inappropriate in circumstances where one party leaves the matrimonial home at separation, and (f) they make an adjustment for the respondent “disallowing” the applicant from maintaining the house when this was not put to the respondent, and in any event the probative evidence is that the parties each did some work on the house and when they did not there were reasons for this.   they apportioned contributions on the basis of a moral
