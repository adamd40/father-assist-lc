reasons for judgment
judge murdoch:
introduction
background
the date of separation  wilburn] and i commenced our relationship in 2011 and we separated on a final basis in january 2020. [mr wilburn] and i had an earlier period of separation after i had been assaulted by [mr wilburn] [in] or about [late] 2019. [mr wilburn] and i continued to live separately and apart under one roof from january 2020 until 29 march 2020. [1]
the decision to end things was [ms quinton]’s. i did not want the relationship to end and [ms quinton] sent me mixed messages over the next few weeks about our relationship. leading up to this date, we would interact as if we were still a couple, which is why i was so surprised when she decided to end the relationship. whilst we were having problems within our relationship, i believe that we had committed to work on the relationship. upon [ms quinton] ending our relationship, we stayed in the same house but were sleeping in separate bedrooms. we continued to jointly care for [x] in the same manner described above. [2]
father: i believe [ms quinton] had vacated the relationship emotionally sooner than she had made me aware that she was leaving. i was blindsided. counsel: so it’s the case that unless [ms quinton] tells you something expressly, then you wouldn’t accept it anyway? father: i’m not a mind reader, sir. i need to be told on how someone is feeling. if a relationship is over, i can’t just guess that.

current circumstances
the legal principles
meaningful relationship
the opportunity for a meaningful relationship with his father can provide [x] a sense of his own identity and origins. regular and predictable time with his father avoids the risk of idealisation or devaluation of an absent parent. [x]’s developing sense of self, self-confidence and self-esteem, would also be enhanced by having some direct knowledge about, and experience of his father - so long as those experiences are comparatively positive, and [x] continues to feel safe. having to navigate a relationship with both of his parents and their respective families may also enhance [x]’s coping and problem-solving skills in dealing with differences and differences within various situations and relationships. [6]
risk of harm
family violence
the alleged sexual assault – in late 2019   wilburn] said that he “do[es] respect the word ‘no’ and that the word “‘no’ was never spoken” but acknowledged that “maybe i misread her body language.....it is “really not my character to be forceful towards women.”..he “never felt i had ownership over [ms quinton] and “never felt entitled to [sexual intercourse.] he stated that if [ms quinton] was not in the mood for sexual activity, “i wouldn’t push it” and said that he would “be a little cranky” if she declined but “would respect that.” [10]
counsel: did you tell the consultant on 3 december 2020 that you maybe misread her body language? father: i did. because there was no indication that my advances weren’t reciprocated. counsel: was there any indication they were reciprocated? father: yes – i don’t want to go into detail but if i have to.... counsel: after the event, wasn’t it the case that the mother made it clear to you that she was not happy with what had occurred? father: not straight after the event – some weeks later.
the damage to the wall – early 2020
i was stressed out and did not want [x] to see me in such a state. i just needed a few minutes to regroup. i went into the bathroom which is quite small. i was emotional and lashed out and my elbow hit the wall creating a hole. the wall was made of [a thin material]. [x] came in and asked about the bang. he saw i was crying and i picked him up and gave him a hug. i eventually fixed the hole after [ms quinton] had moved out.[11]
coercive and controlling behaviour
counsel: isn’t this another occasion [in early 2020] when you depose you were separated – where the mother had left the house to be away from you, that you were contacting her? father: she didn’t leave the house to get away from me she was out on a night with friends. counsel: she was out on a night with friends, and you weren’t respecting her time away from you, were you? father: i’m sorry, we had a kid together in the same house. we were in contact regardless of where she was. it wasn’t me trying to dominate and control her in any way. counsel: well why couldn’t the communication wait until she got home? father: if i had a question – i asked when i needed to ask a question. she was always free to respond in her own time. counsel: so it is the case that you just send a message when you want to. father: don’t we all? counsel: the mother was with her friends father: she hadn’t requested that i leave her alone. counsel: so if she doesn’t say it out loud – father: i respect her time away – but a text message, she is free to respond in her own time. counsel: i put it to you that you don’t respect her time away because you text her. father: am i not allowed to text a person i’m in a relationship with in any given moment? i didn’t understand that to be a rule. if she requested time alone then i would respect that but in a relationship, on any given day, at any given time, we would communicate.
generally, coercive control is understood as a course of conduct aimed at dominating and controlling another person, including a family member.
the assessment of whether conduct that falls within one of the provided examples constitutes family violence as defined in s 4ab(1) of the act necessarily requires that conduct to be considered in the context in which it occurred.

conclusion as to harm
....information that is available seems to establish that, at least in [early] 2020, [x] was exposed to various situations in the former family home which very likely created stress for [x] and for each of his parents. this included [x] likely being exposed to conflict between his parents, parental distress and/or emotional dysregulation, property damage, an episode of binge drinking on behalf of the father which resulted in [x] being left inside his home alone and without a suitable carer, and the involvement of police and emergency services in searching for the father who went missing after having made comments to the mother that suggested he could be at risk of suicide. such dysfunctional parenting and behaviour on behalf of the father is of concern, not least because in relation to events [in early] 2020, as noted, [x] was at home and alone with his father, who had been entrusted by the mother to take care of their son.[22]
no concerns have been noted in contact observation reports about child safety concerns, the nature of parent/child interactions, or [x]’s behaviour at the beginning, during or end of visits. the father has not behaved in any manner which the supervisor was concerned about or has required the supervisor to intervene. the father's responses and capabilities to meet [x]’s needs during visits and his behaviour appear to have been considered by supervisors appropriate.[23]
the additional considerations
given [x]’s age when his parents separate and the three intervening years in which [mr f] has been a constant presence in his home and in his life, [x]’s view of his mother’s partner as a father figure is considered (from [x]’s perspective) understandable.[25]
.. a number of [x]’s responses suggest that he has a level of awareness of his mother’s feelings surrounding, and her and [mr f]’s vigilance over, his safety when in the care of his father. he also appears to have some sense that accepting gifts from his father could potentially be an issue. .... he understands that a supervisor is required whenever he spends time with his father in case [mr wilburn] "does something" or "something happens" or in case he (i.e. [x]) wants to go home early. [x] spontaneously informed the report writer that he has yet to ever want to leave a visit with his father early.[27]   speculated that his mother and [mr f] might feel "a little nervous or something" at the prospect of him spending unsupervised time with his father or time in his father's home. he was less sure how he might feel. in response to the report writer inviting [x] to tell her more about this, [x] spoke about his father being someone who made "naughty choices" such that his mother and [mr f] continue to worry that his father could potentially do something that results in [x] being hurt. [x] then immediately went on to comment that he knows his father is "trying to stop [using]”.[28]
...unintentionally placed the burden of protecting [x] and their family on [x]’s young shoulders. it also forces [x] to choose one parent over the other, communicates to him that it is okay to lie or hide information and means that he potentially spends considerable emotional energy censoring his conversation with his father and thinking about what he can and cannot say. this could all be additional sources of stress and confusion for [x]. it also risks him becoming embroiled in his parents' conflict or carrying unnecessary guilt if he lets something slip, all of which is obviously not in [x]’s best interests.[30]
....the social, legal and financial pressures associated with substance misuse can make it more difficult to parent adequately. it is also worth commenting that cognitive impairment in [illicit substance] use include users tending to make riskier decisions than others and to have more problems with planning. there is also information that suggests [illicit substances] can lead to, or exacerbate existing, mental health problems. if a parent was routinely affected by [an illicit substance] (or alcohol) there could be risks to [x] associated with that parent’s ability to consistently provide a stable and safe environment for [x], maintain household tasks and routines, and sensitively and appropriately respond to [x]’s physical and emotional needs. it could also give rise to safety concerns and risk in relation to driving, inappropriate matters of discipline and/or injury from supervisory neglect. [31]
overall [ms quinton] worries that the more time the father spends with [x], the greater risk that the father could implode or self-destruct and the consequences for [x] of witnessing such an event, would be both damaging and frightening. compounding her concerns is that she harbours doubts that the father has any insight into how his behaviour has adversely impacted her and [x].[32]
all of this suggests that, provided that [mr wilburn] is not using drugs or alcohol and remains open and willing to seek appropriate support for any stress or mental health or relationship issues he may experience, he is likely capable of providing for x’s needs to a good enough level. [34]
