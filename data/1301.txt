...the significance of [z]’s autistic makeup, for the question of his contact with his father, is that his autism exacerbates the serious emotional and relationship difficulties arising from the circumstance of parental separation, with exposure to parental conflict.

based on the information provided for this reportable family therapy and my observations and assessments, the children [x], [z] and [y] will benefit from a meaningful relationship with their father as much as with their mother. until [the mother] can reach a more settled and nuanced appreciation of [the father’s] capacity as a parent however, it is unlikely that she will support progressively increased time for the children with their father. [the father] has demonstrated considerable willingness to comply with the expectations of the court and ... he has been responsive to interventions and recommendations. more than [the mother], [the father] has utilised the resource of a family therapy approach.

did you not, did you not tell him that he was welcome to come? did you not tell him that he was welcome to come? did you not say that i’m stopping you from seeing them? call the police if you like, but i’m not doing anything wrong, i’m following court orders.
you know what is wrong with him? it’s you that’s wrong with him. look what you’ve done to your child. look what you’ve done to your child. [ms q], [ms q], if you ever need me, you know where i am.

in this case i consider that the respondent was most careful to ensure that her conduct was to be seen (and witnessed) as attempting to give effect to the orders for the father to spend time with [x] and [y] whilst all the while considering that the order did not serve the children’s interests and that the children were unsafe and were not to be going with their father. the evidence does not disclose that the mother gave any firm direction to the children to go with their father nor made any attempt on the occasions in question to leave the children with their father which i consider, in all of the circumstances, would have been reasonable attempts to comply with the orders in question. in this matter, the respondent was prepared to go only so far and no further in ensuring the children went with the father on the occasions complained of. the fact that the applicant resorted to effectively inviting the children to come within at changeovers does not, in my view, establish that the respondent has fully discharged her obligation to encourage by meaningfully and genuinely directing the children to go with their father, rather, his presenting “options” to the children is to be regarded as the product of the mother’s failure to fulfil her obligations and to improperly cast those obligations upon the father and the children. i do not find the evidence as to the circumstances of the cutting of [y]’s hair [in early] 2023 by his father to be a reason for his or his brother's time with their father under the order to cease on account of physical or emotional safety issues. after all, after that date the mother continued to present the children for time with their father. the issue of the cutting of [y]’s hair became a critical matter as the mother permitted it to be so to further her views about the father. it does not constitute a “reasonable excuse” for the contravention which has occurred in all of the circumstances. i am not satisfied that the mother has shielded the children from her own views about the father to the extent that she can feel free and let the children know that she is content for the children to go with their father or to be left with him. this is not, as was submitted on behalf of the mother, “to condemn her for her feelings” but rather to find against her case as her actions which are a product of her attitudes are permitted by her to act inconsistently with the obligations created by the interim orders. just as the mother’s views did not preclude the making of the primary orders, they cannot now be taken to permit non-compliance with those orders. i am not satisfied that the mother has otherwise discharged the onus to establish a “reasonable excuse” for the children to not spend time with their father and has effectively chaperoned and guided (but not encouraged in an appropriate way) and permitted the children to return with her from changeover.[6]
changeovers generally
impact of the mother’s views and behaviour on the children
while [the mother] acknowledges the principle of the need for a meaningful relationship for the children with their father, she is either wittingly or unwittingly influencing an ongoing sense for the children that somehow [the father] continues to be both physically and psychologically dangerous. she presents with expecting that [the father] will fail to respond appropriately to the children’s needs and this is fuelled by the children’s purported reports to her following visits. ... [the children] present as emotionally aligned with the mother, with [x] for example speaking of life without [the father] being preferable. [z] also said that his mother would be ‘better off’ without [the father’s] involvement in their life. ..it is [z]’s relationship with [the mother] that presents a concern, particularly for his ability to establish a more nuanced relationship with his father and a more developmentally independent relationship with his mother.   and [y] play games around their safety plans, of which they developed themselves. they often wait up a tree with weapons and making traps and talk about what they would do should he come again to try and get them. their play involved packing bags with their treasured belongings and hiding in forts they have built.
... a very self-sacrificing person. he wants – he is very clear about wanting to take away what he describes as the big, fat finger, which is [mr sachin], who is literally controlling us in every way, in our own home, even though he’s not actually there. he wants to protect us...
assessment of risk
exposure to negative information about their parents can be as harmful to children as their direct negative experiences, particularly if a child has a vulnerability such as neurodiversity. children view parents as a part of themselves, and if they have a wholly negative view of a parent, then a part of them becomes unacceptable, as such their sense of self and identity formation can be fragmented or distorted.
the benefit to x, z, and y of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents
despite the challenges, [the father] remained upbeat and managed the children’s resistance gently, with eventually a genuine, easy interaction forming between him, [y] and [z]. [the father] appears to have a positive relationship with [y] but a strained relationship with [z] and [x]. [the father] indicated that this observation was not to be outside of what was expected with the boys in a new environment.
additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give those views
the nature of the children’s relationships with each of their parents and other significant persons in their lives
the extent to which the children’s parents have taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in long-term decision making in relation to the children, to spend time and to communicate with the children
the extent to which each of the children’s parents have fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of a change in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect of a separation from a parent or other significant persons in their lives
the practical difficulty and expense associated with the children spending time and communicating with a parent, and whether that difficulty substantially affects the children’s right to maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of the children’s parents and any other significant person to provide for their needs, including their emotional and intellectual needs
mother’s capacity to meet the children’s educational needs  y: (i) for semester 1, was absent for 26.5 days and was late for 25 days, noting than more than 20 days of absence is considered “very poor”, (ii) for term 2, attended 58% of school, and (iii) for term 3, attended only 22% of school, and (b) z: (i) for semester 1, was absent for 18.5 days and was late for 29 days, noting that 11 to 20 days of absence is considered “poor”, (ii) for term 2, attended 65% of school, and (iii) for term 3, attended 62% of school.   for semester 1, was absent for 26.5 days and was late for 25 days, noting than more than 20 days of absence is considered “very poor”, (ii) for term 2, attended 58% of school, and (iii) for term 3, attended only 22% of school, and  ) for term 2, attended 58% of school, and (iii) for term 3, attended only 22% of school, and  i) for term 3, attended only 22% of school, and   z: (i) for semester 1, was absent for 18.5 days and was late for 29 days, noting that 11 to 20 days of absence is considered “poor”, (ii) for term 2, attended 65% of school, and (iii) for term 3, attended 62% of school.   for semester 1, was absent for 18.5 days and was late for 29 days, noting that 11 to 20 days of absence is considered “poor”, (ii) for term 2, attended 65% of school, and (iii) for term 3, attended 62% of school.  ) for term 2, attended 65% of school, and (iii) for term 3, attended 62% of school.  i) for term 3, attended 62% of school.
father’s capacity to meet the children’s needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and their parents, and any other characteristics of the children the court thinks relevant ’s verbal and physical expressions of anger toward [the father] appear extreme and seem somewhat disproportionate to his reported experiences of his father. [z]’s negative views and aggressive behaviours likely reflect the highly complex parenting and developmental dynamics [z] is trying to navigate. [z]’s presentation is likely to have been influenced by his experience of autism, symptoms of which can include difficulty engaging with others, fixed binary thinking and aggressive behaviours. additional factors that may have affected [z]’s presentation may include exposure to family violence, poor experiences of father’s parenting and/or negatively influences by his mother. regardless of the basis of [z]’s behaviour, [z] making comments about his life being negatively affected by [the father] and his threats to harm [the father], raise considerable concern for [z]’s emotional well-being and need to be actively discouraged by both parents and his therapeutic supports in a consistent way. such issues persisting into the challenging developmental tasks of adolescence could have significant implications for [z]’s development, functioning and relationships into the future.

he’s using the children to access me and if that means through – through ivo proceedings – if that means through constantly reporting to the police – if that means through contravention – if that means not picking them up at school and me having to do a second, third, fourth attempt at changeover so that he can have access to me.
