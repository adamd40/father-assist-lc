relevant legal principles
review applications
14.07 procedure for review   a court must hear an application for review of an exercise of power by a senior judicial registrar or judicial registrar as an original hearing.
note: in an original hearing, the court rehears the whole matter and does not simply review the decision of the original court.   the just determination of all proceedings before the federal circuit and family court of australia (division 2),   the efficient disposal of the court’s overall caseload, (c) the disposal of all proceedings in a timely manner, and (d) the resolution of disputes at a cost that is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matters in dispute.   the resolution of disputes at a cost that is proportionate to the importance and complexity of the matters in dispute.
overarching purpose 1.04   the overarching purpose of these rules, as provided by section 67 of the federal circuit and family court act, is to facilitate the just resolution of disputes according to law and as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible.
note 1: these rules must be interpreted and applied, and any power conferred or duty imposed by them must be exercised or carried out, in the way that best promotes the overarching purpose (see subsection 67(3) of the federal circuit and family court act). note 2: see sections 190 and 191 of the federal circuit and family court act in relation to the overarching purpose of the rules of the federal circuit and family court (division 2). see also the federal circuit and family court of australia (division 2) (family law) rules 2021 which applies these rules with modifications.   parties to family law proceedings must conduct the proceeding (including negotiations for settlement of the dispute to which the proceeding relates) in a way that is consistent with the overarching purpose.  .]  .] the new court system of having registrars undertake interlocutory work should not be treated as an invitation to simply lodge review applications without careful consideration of the need for a review application, and the importance of properly using the court’s resources. a registrar’s hearing should not be used as a ‘dry run’ or a ‘practice run’ at a case, but rather the main event, with a review application there in the background, in a similar way to that of an appeal if it were a judge dealing with the matter. if the system is not approached in this manner, then litigants and practitioners can expect costs and other consequential orders, to ensure that the processes of the court are not misused or wasted. (emphasis added)  phasis added)   it is unnecessary for the applicant for review to demonstrate any material error of fact or principle in the order under review.   although on review, the court should consider the matter afresh, it does not follow that the reasoning of the registrar should be ignored, or that variations in the material presented to her, or him, and the evidence that was adduced are irrelevant. the starting point is, therefore, the decision that is to be reviewed. the court does not merely cast that decision to one side and proceed as if it had never been made. the court will have regard to the basis on which the decision was made and the material placed before the court itself on the application for review: wily re led (south coast) pty ltd [2009] nswsc 946 at [24] – [26].
the real question is whether there are any grounds, or any reasons, which would warrant a review of the orders that have been made by the registrar: al-shennag v statewide roads pty limited at [47]. [...] (emphasis added)

consideration
order 10
my position today, firstly, i refer to order (10), requesting i place $27,000 in the respondent’s previous law firm trust. this is the primary issue of today for several reasons. number 1, i have found no mention of this $27,000 in the respondent’s affidavits.   the response to initiating application, ‘interlocutory orders sought by you the respondent’, [5b], annexure “a”, paragraph [19] (reference to $26,700), (b) the respondent’s 2 december 2022 affidavit at: paragraph [12] and annexure “a” ‘de facto wife’s balance sheet’, item 13 (reference to $26,700), and paragraph [119] (reference to $27,000), (c) the respondent’s 8 december 2022 outline of case, part e ‘minute of orders sought’, annexure “a”, paragraph [19] (reference to $26,700), (d) the respondent’s application in a proceeding, part d ‘the orders you are seeking’ and annexure “a”, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000), (e) the respondent’s 22 march 2023 affidavit, paragraph [20] and annexure “a” ‘de facto wife’s balance sheet’, item 13 (reference to $26,700), and (f) the respondent’s 30 may 2023 outline of case: part c ‘issues in dispute’ (reference to $27,000), and part e ‘minute of orders sought’, minute of orders sought, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000).   the respondent’s 2 december 2022 affidavit at: paragraph [12] and annexure “a” ‘de facto wife’s balance sheet’, item 13 (reference to $26,700), and paragraph [119] (reference to $27,000), (c) the respondent’s 8 december 2022 outline of case, part e ‘minute of orders sought’, annexure “a”, paragraph [19] (reference to $26,700), (d) the respondent’s application in a proceeding, part d ‘the orders you are seeking’ and annexure “a”, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000), (e) the respondent’s 22 march 2023 affidavit, paragraph [20] and annexure “a” ‘de facto wife’s balance sheet’, item 13 (reference to $26,700), and (f) the respondent’s 30 may 2023 outline of case: part c ‘issues in dispute’ (reference to $27,000), and part e ‘minute of orders sought’, minute of orders sought, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000).   the respondent’s 8 december 2022 outline of case, part e ‘minute of orders sought’, annexure “a”, paragraph [19] (reference to $26,700), (d) the respondent’s application in a proceeding, part d ‘the orders you are seeking’ and annexure “a”, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000), (e) the respondent’s 22 march 2023 affidavit, paragraph [20] and annexure “a” ‘de facto wife’s balance sheet’, item 13 (reference to $26,700), and (f) the respondent’s 30 may 2023 outline of case: part c ‘issues in dispute’ (reference to $27,000), and part e ‘minute of orders sought’, minute of orders sought, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000).   the respondent’s application in a proceeding, part d ‘the orders you are seeking’ and annexure “a”, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000), (e) the respondent’s 22 march 2023 affidavit, paragraph [20] and annexure “a” ‘de facto wife’s balance sheet’, item 13 (reference to $26,700), and (f) the respondent’s 30 may 2023 outline of case: part c ‘issues in dispute’ (reference to $27,000), and part e ‘minute of orders sought’, minute of orders sought, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000).   the respondent’s 22 march 2023 affidavit, paragraph [20] and annexure “a” ‘de facto wife’s balance sheet’, item 13 (reference to $26,700), and (f) the respondent’s 30 may 2023 outline of case: part c ‘issues in dispute’ (reference to $27,000), and part e ‘minute of orders sought’, minute of orders sought, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000).   the respondent’s 30 may 2023 outline of case: part c ‘issues in dispute’ (reference to $27,000), and part e ‘minute of orders sought’, minute of orders sought, paragraph [3] (reference to $27,000).  .] i wish to make it clear. i do not have and have never had $27,000 in my mother’s safe. i have had $22,864 in my possession around the time of separation. the $22,864 has been dissipated into the new company with full explanation. $27,000 going to a lawyer’s trust fund has no effect on the respondent but will have an extreme hardship on me. i do not have $27,000 available to put in trust. that’s the primary reason i stand here today. i had $22,865 at the time of separation in cash funds total. the respondent had more than an estimated $22,000 in her personal bank account at time of separation. i call this a position of equal hardship.
and yet, the respondent and their team still persist on putting this arbitrary figure of $27,000 up. if you look through all affidavits, you will see that i have always claimed i’ve never had $27,000 and to this day, i still claim that. so therefore, that is a blatant mistake on their behalf and sadly on senior judicial registrar’s behalf for obviously taking on that as the number, in the sense that that number has never existed and has never been quantified by the respondent, even though i’ve given full disclosure.
prima facie case  the respondent’s alleged disruptive behaviour, (b) that the 20 december 2022 consent orders did not contain any restraint on the applicant: operating his own business, or using the assets of j pty ltd for any other purpose, and (c) the applicant was able to take control of the assets of j pty ltd because he already “had control” of these assets, and (d) even though the respondent had been deprived of her wage from j pty ltd, she had “ample income at her disposal and has no need for this wage”.   that the 20 december 2022 consent orders did not contain any restraint on the applicant: operating his own business, or using the assets of j pty ltd for any other purpose, and (c) the applicant was able to take control of the assets of j pty ltd because he already “had control” of these assets, and (d) even though the respondent had been deprived of her wage from j pty ltd, she had “ample income at her disposal and has no need for this wage”.   the applicant was able to take control of the assets of j pty ltd because he already “had control” of these assets, and (d) even though the respondent had been deprived of her wage from j pty ltd, she had “ample income at her disposal and has no need for this wage”.   even though the respondent had been deprived of her wage from j pty ltd, she had “ample income at her disposal and has no need for this wage”.
risk of disposal of the funds .] [mr linford] has not been meeting all of the necessary expenses and i have no confidence that he will do so. i have no confidence in [mr linford] being honest about the income of the new entity. i’m very concerned about [mr linford] putting me into a position where [k group] will be insolvent and i might be called upon to act in relation to the guarantees on the vehicles and even the security in my home at [suburb g] which i had before i met [mr linford].
hardship to each party  the loan of $19,900 to the applicant’s current country e partner, (b) the payment of $24,400 for the building works in country e, (c) the regular donations to: country e, the applicant’s church, to bb organisation and to the cc organisation, and (d) the w business.   the payment of $24,400 for the building works in country e, (c) the regular donations to: country e, the applicant’s church, to bb organisation and to the cc organisation, and (d) the w business.   the regular donations to: country e, the applicant’s church, to bb organisation and to the cc organisation, and (d) the w business.   the w business.
