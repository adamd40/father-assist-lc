mr aa
i asked [mr aa] if he could describe the above in affidavit format. he refused as he has moved on with his life and does not want the stress of a court proceeding. i was raised with a culture that teaches us to respect people's wishes, so when my solicitor advised me i could subpoena [mr aa] to attend and provide this evidence at court, however, i advised my solicitor that due to my religion and family respect (i have children with him), i am not willing to push that boundary and will not force him to give this evidence to the court...[214]
both parties could have subpoenaed him, but the onus of establishing the jurisdictional question fell on the applicant. the matter was before the court for a substantial period and the applicant was aware that the respondent did not intend to call mr aa.

submissions regarding the failure to call witnesses
jones v dunkel  ll evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other side to have contradicted.[219]
what should have been added, and not being added was in the circumstances as good as denied, was that any inference favourable to the plaintiff for which there was ground in the evidence might be more confidently drawn when a person presumably able to put the true complexion on the facts relied on as the ground for the inference has not been called as a witness by the defendant and the evidence provides no sufficient explanation of his absence.[221]
"in my opinion a proper direction in the circumstances should have made three things clear: (i) that the absence of the defendant hegedus as a witness cannot be used to make up any deficiency of evidence, (ii) that evidence which might have been contradicted by the defendant can be accepted the more readily if the defendant fails to give evidence, (iii) that where an inference is open from facts proved by direct evidence and the question is whether it should be drawn, the circumstance that the defendant disputing it might have proved the contrary had he chosen to give evidence is properly to be taken into account as a circumstance in favour of drawing the inference."
the law – section 4aa of the family law act 1975 (cth)
1. a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if: the persons are not legally married to each other, and the persons are not related by family (see subsection (6)), and having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis. paragraph (c) has effect subject to subsection (5). working out if persons have a relationship as a couple 2. those circumstances may include any or all of the following: the duration of the relationship, the nature and extent of their common residence, whether a sexual relationship exists, the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, the care and support of children’ the reputation and public aspects of the relationship. no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case. 5. for the purposes of this act: a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship. when 2 persons are related by family 6. for the purposes of subsection (1), 2 persons are related by family if: one is the child (including an adopted child) of the other, or one is another descendant of the other (even if the relationship between them is traced through an adoptive parent), or they have a parent in common (who may be an adoptive parent of either or both of them) for this purpose, disregard whether an adoption is declared void or has ceased to have effect.
1. if: an application is made for an order under section 90se, 90sg or 90sm, or a declaration under section 90sl, and a claim is made, in support of the application, that a de facto relationship existed between the applicant and another person, the court may, for the purposes of those proceedings (the primary proceedings), declare that a de facto relationship existed, or never existed, between those 2 persons. a declaration under subsection (1) of the existence of a de facto relationship may also declare any or all of the following: the period, or periods, of the de facto relationship for the purposes of paragraph 90sb(a), whether there is a child of the de facto relationship, whether one of the parties to the de facto relationship made substantial contributions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90sm(4)(a), (b) or (c), when the de facto relationship ended, where each of the parties to the de facto relationship was ordinarily resident during the de facto relationship.
were the applicant and the respondent in a de facto relationship?  s honour extracts the contents of s 90rd(2), as already extracted in paragraph {99}} of these reasons]
32. section 4aa provides:  s honour extracts the contents of s 4aa, as already extracted in paragraph 98} of these reasons] in crowley & pappas [2013] famca 783 tree j identifies the difficulty for courts in determining whether there is a de facto relationship given the plethora of factors that might argue for or against such a relationship. at [8] his honour says: those provisions, or their state counterparts, have been the subject of considerable judicial discussion, principally in an attempt to more precisely analyse what will comprise “a couple”. much of that analysis seems to have its genesis in the difficulty in satisfactorily distilling the essence of such a common, everyday concept. from those decisions the following propositions may be stated: (a) whether a de facto relationship exists or not is a question of fact, not a matter of discretion, (b) a de facto relationship does not need to be akin to a marriage although the nature of the association involved in a marriage relationship may be instructive, (c) the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time, (d) there need not be full time living together, (e) the relationship may be unhappy, but still subsisting, (f) sexual or other exclusivity is not necessary, (g) the gist of the inquiry is the degree to which parties have merged their lives into one. that connotes financial, emotional and physical interdependence. (footnotes omitted) as put to each counsel in their final submissions, it is entirely plausible for each of the parties to have a different view or understanding of the nature of their relationship. that is, one person may believe that they are in a relationship which satisfies the status of 'de facto' and the other not so. the full court in sinclair & whitaker [2013] famcafc 129, (2013) flc 93-551 noted: given the nature of the definition of a de facto relationship in the act, the ultimate decision as to whether there is a de facto relationship in any given time is a matter for the court and not a matter for the parties. although their perception of the nature of the relationship is a relevant matter, it is not determinative. each counsel in the matter now before me, however, urged me to make findings of credit, or lack thereof, so as to assist me in my determination as to the status of the relationship between the parties.   whether a de facto relationship exists or not is a question of fact, not a matter of discretion, (b) a de facto relationship does not need to be akin to a marriage although the nature of the association involved in a marriage relationship may be instructive, (c) the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time, (d) there need not be full time living together, (e) the relationship may be unhappy, but still subsisting, (f) sexual or other exclusivity is not necessary, (g) the gist of the inquiry is the degree to which parties have merged their lives into one. that connotes financial, emotional and physical interdependence.

36. in jonah & white murphy j observed at [8] and [10]:
the issue here, in my view, is not so much the veracity or reliability of the parties’ accounts of events, but rather, the picture presented by the totality of them and the conclusion/s resulting therefrom. ... i consider that the evidence of each of the parties was affected significantly by the fact that their recollection now, in respect of events past, was refracted through the prism of their own perceptions of the relationship and of the varying degrees of disappointment felt by each at its demise ...
37. at [60] in jonah & white (supra) murphy j opined:
in my opinion, the key to that definition [de facto relationship] is the manifestation of a relationship where “the parties have so merged their lives that they were, for all practical purposes, 'living together' as a couple on a genuine domestic basis”. it is the manifestation of ‘coupledom’, which involves the merger of two lives as just described, that is the core of a de facto relationship as defined and to which each of the statutory factors (and others that might apply to a particular relationship) are directed. similarly, before the introduction into the act, fitzgerald, j in lynam v director general of social security where his honour was required to determine whether the parties were living together on a bona fide domestic basis, noted: .. each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which might point in one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate any individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of opposite sex meets the statutory test. the applicant, asserting a fact, namely the existence of a de facto relationship, carries an onus of establishing that there was a de facto relationship and to do so according to the requisite standard of proof being on the balance of probabilities. it is not for the respondent, and arguably logically impossible, to carry an onus to prove a negative relationship did not exist.[224]
... it is important to note that his honour’s comments were made in the context of the facts of the matter that was before him. it is clear from reading the judgment as a whole that his honour had the statutory definition firmly in mind at all times. when dismissing the appeal from his honour’s decision the full court did not disagree with his honour’s statements of principle but did not apply anything other than the statutory test (jonah & white (2012) flc 93 – 522) ... it bears repeating too that in dismissing the appeal from murphy j’s decision, the full court in jonah & white said at 86, that “[i]t is immediately apparent that the touchstone for the determination of whether a de facto relationship exists is the finding that the parties to it are a “couple living together on a genuine domestic basis”. indeed, as the full court said in sinclair: comments made in the course of discussing facts are not to be elevated to the status of the provisions of the statute or substituted for the statutory test. this is because, taken on their own, they either add nothing to the statutory test or, if they do, they are adding an impermissible gloss. thus it is not appropriate to consider the facts other than in the light of the statutory test. sinclair itself has been followed by subsequent full courts (cadman & hallett [2014] famcafc 142, (2014) flc 93-603, onslow & onslow [2016] famcafc 7, fleming & schmidt [2017] famcafc 12, sha & cham [2017] famcafc 161, cuan & kostelac [2017] famcafc 188, (2017) flc 93-801). to repeat and rely on statements made at first instance which have been overtaken and corrected by several full courts, as the primary judge did here, is to invite error. section 4aa(1)(c) of the act is clear:  a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if: ...  having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.
17. the passage from the high court’s judgment at [33] bears reproduction: living together for the purposes of s 4aa(1) will often, perhaps usually, mean cohabitation of some residence by a couple for some period of time. but cohabitation of a residence or residences is not a necessary feature of “living together”. that phrase must be construed to take account of the many various ways in which two people may share their lives together in the modern world. two people, for any number of reasons, may not reside in the same residence, but nonetheless be in a de facto relationship in the sense required by s 4aa. (footnote omitted) later at [39] the court stated that living together should be construed as meaning sharing life as a couple: the language of s 4aa of the act and its reference to “living together” requires no different approach to determining whether a relationship exists of the kind defined. “living together”, consistently with authority, should be construed as meaning sharing life as a couple. section 4aa does not prescribe any way by which a couple may share life together. its language is sufficiently broad to accommodate the great variety of ways a de facto relationship may exist. that conclusion is supported by the varied factors listed in s 4aa(2). in a given case, some of the factors listed in s 4aa(2) may be relevant and some may be irrelevant, inevitably some may have greater prominence than others. a conclusion that a de facto relationship has ended may also arise because of factors not listed in s 4aa(2). such a conclusion is mandated by s 4aa(3) and (4). in particular, s 4aa(4) is a statutory recognition that what may constitute a genuine de facto relationship is not be determined in the same way in every case by reference to rigid criteria that must always be satisfied. in that respect, the language of s 4aa(2)(b) does not assume that every de facto relationship must have a “common residence” to some “extent” and of some “nature”. such a construction is entirely denied by s 4aa(3). (footnote omitted) the high court has arguably clarified that parties do not need to live together in order to be in a de facto relationship if they are sharing life as a couple. this however does not mean that every couple sharing life is necessarily living in a de facto relationship. the court must have regard to all of the evidence, including to the matters referred to in s 4aa(2) of the act. on one view, the phrase “sharing life” is simply a general summary of the s 4aa(2) circumstances.
application of s 4aa
the duration of the relationship (s 4aa(2)(a))
...i disagree in full. the real position is that [mr khoi] and i had no sexual relationship, and our relationship was a purely platonic friendship. i have never even touched [mr khoi] in any intimate manner. i certainly did not have any sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual activity with [mr khoi]. i have never kissed [mr khoi]. i have never felt like kissing [mr khoi]. i never had any desire to have any physical or sexual relationship with [mr khoi]. it disgusts and revolts me on an emotional level that [mr khoi] wants to define our 'relationship' as being de facto.[235]
dear sir/madam my name is [mr b]. date of birth 1975 i have tried to communicate with immigration department to report my relationship with my partner “[ms z], dob 1995) has been ended approx 10 months ago. please be advised my partner [ms z] has left our family home and living with new partner. in addition, i have been informed my partner has been pregnant and having a new baby with her new partner recently. i request your office to attend on this matter and cancel my application for partner sponsorship. i can be contacted on [...]. best regards [mr b][237]
as such, she argued, they could not have been a de facto relationship prior to 2017, as the applicant claimed. other evidence, including the photograph of her and mr aa celebrating their wedding anniversary in 2014, also countered the applicant’s position, as did the evidence that the applicant married ms z in 2014.
conclusion regarding the duration of the relationship
the nature and extent of their common residence (s 4aa(2)(b))
i occupied the living room and slept on a sofa bed. [ms khoi] would stay with us about 5 nights per week because it is within walking distance to her former workplace and on the other nights she would live at her parents’ home in [suburb u], where her children were living at the time.[292]
after [mr khoi] lost his litigation against his sister, i really felt bad for him. i wanted to help him as i know he was struggling financially and he also had marriage problems with [ms z]. i knew about all of his health problems and i also knew that medicare did not cover everything. while i now understand that i should not add friends to my private health insurance, the feeling of helplessness overcame me and i added [mr khoi] to my [ab company] private health insurance on around [early] 2017 along with my family, allowing him to receive better quality of medical attention.[313]
this explanation is plausible. the respondent was known for helping other members of the country ww community. ms nn also confirmed that the applicant told her that the respondent had been very helpful to him.
conclusion regarding the nature and extent of their common residence
these matters were not adequately explained by the applicant.
whether a sexual relationship exists (s 4aa(2)(c))
the real position is that [mr khoi] and i had no sexual relationship, and our relationship was purely platonic friendship. i have never even touched [mr khoi] in any intimate manner. i certainly did not have any sexual intercourse or engage in any sexual activity with [mr khoi]. i have never kissed [mr khoi]. i have never felt like kissing [mr khoi]. i never had any desire to have any physical or sexual relationship with [mr khoi]. it disgusts and revolts me on an emotional level that [mr khoi] wants to define our ‘relationship’ as being de facto.[332]
body marks / tattoos   bs] and ms wilson agree to the following: [in] 2023 we inspected [ms khoi] (the respondent) and saw the following: [detailed descriptions of first tattoo]. [detailed descriptions of second tattoo]”. on [one body part]: little freckle [...], very small scar [...]. on [another body part]: a faded larger scar [...]. two [...] faded scars [...] (very feint). a stretch mark [...] (very feint). freckle [...]. [...] freckle [...]. very small freckle [...]. large [...] freckle [...] one small [freckle]. very feint. brown-ish colour. one tiny [freckle]. very feint. brown-ish colour.
conclusions regarding whether a sexual relationship exists
the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them (s 4aa(2)(d))
the court proceedings  khoi] assisted me because she knew i was a victim of [a serious crime] and was facing crushing financial loss [...]. she assisted me because she was my partner and saw my loss as her loss.[341]

a. all of the remainder of my real and personal estate to: my friend [ms ee] my son [mr bb] my son [mr cc] [mr khoi]'s son [mr ff] [mr khoi]’s son [gg] as shall survive me and if more than one as tenants in common in equal shares absolutely.[361]
i do not totally agree with what you say because this matter is not related to somebody’s education or background or knowledge. for your information at that time my mother passed away and i thought that and i would die very soon because i suffer from [a medical condition]. and when i visited the doctor the diagnosis was that there was possibility of [an illness] and i didn’t’ know what to do. and right now i don’t know how to answer or explain to you.[363]
that’s not the truth. that decision didn’t come from a romantic relationship, it didn’t originate from love but at that time i was just feeling sorry for him, i felt pity for him properly. i was haunted at that time, i was so scared and terrified and i don’t know exactly why i made that decisions. regarding my family background, i was trained to love people, to feel sorry for people who are in difficult situations and [mr khoi] persuaded me that he had been cheated, he had been deceived by everybody. even his wife and his sister deceive him. he needed to go back to [country ww] and at that time i felt that if i could do something to help him, that even if i pass away, that is worth doing. it is not decision from the romantic relationship.[364]

in about 2015 whilst i was working with [mr aa] and [ms khoi] at [kk pty ltd], we decided to purchase a property situated the [town s] property for approximately $540,000. the [town s] property was purchased in equal shares between the three of us but we decided it was best to register the property under [mr aa]’s sole name because he had the longest employment history that enabled him to borrow funds with favourable terms. i contributed $80,000 towards the total purchase price from personal savings. this contribution was largely made up from my personal savings i had accumulated before we started our relationship.[367]
...the part i disagree with is that the [town s] property was purchased with financial contribution from [mr khoi], the [town s] property was bought between [mr aa], myself and a loan from [mr aa]’s sister, [ms bh].[368]

... [from annexure ms khoi-6]
our client confirms he has complied with the orders of 24 november 2021 by providing your client with centrelink records containing details of his relationship status through service by email transmission on 22 december 2021. we again attach centrelink records for ease of reference. for greater clarity, we refer your client to page 4 wherein it is stated our client was not partnered as being the status of his relationship, meaning that he was not in a relationship whilst in receipt of centrelink payment.[467] (emphasis added)  hen a party has made representations of fact to third parties and has gained advantage from so doing, it is open to the court in subsequent proceedings under s 79 [or s 90sm] of the family law act to decline to accept from that party evidence which contradicts those representations.[468]
... the elias line of authorities is wrong insofar as it suggests that there is a principle, apart from estoppel the court may or must prevent a party from leading evidence of a proposition that is inconsistent with an earlier statement made to a third party. it follows that in property cases the court will consider all the evidence and make findings about the property of the parties and about their contributions. earlier inconsistent statements of the kind that feature in the elias cases will of course be relevant to this fact finding exercise. the court will have to consider whether the earlier statement or the later statement is more likely to be true. further, the contradiction will be taken into account in determining what confidence the court will have in that party’s evidence generally. that all of this falls into the ordinary process of fact finding: no evidence would be excluded, and there would be no presumptions that one or other of the inconsistent statements is more likely to be true.[472]
