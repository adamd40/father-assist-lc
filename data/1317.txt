judge newbrun:
legal principles relating to an application to reopen evidence after judgment has been reserved
according to the full court in stephens & stephens & anor (enforcement) [2009] famcafc 240 at [272], the fundamental principle to apply in an application to reopen a hearing after judgment has been reserved is “whether the interests of justice are better served by allowing the application or rejecting it.” this statement was cited with approval by the full court in sweep & sweep [2018] famcafc 228 at [45]. in determining whether the interests of justice are better served, consideration may be given to ‘discretionary factors’ set out in australian securities and investments commission v rich [2006] nswsc 826, (2006) 235 alr 587 at 593 (“asic v rich”) being: (a) the nature of the proceeding,   whether the occasion for calling the further evidence ought reasonably to have been foreseen, (c) the consideration of fairness that the defendant is entitled to know all of the evidence he has to meet in taking forensic decisions as to cross-examination and the nature and extent of the evidence he will himself adduce on the matters in question, (d) the extent to which the plaintiff has embarked upon calling evidence on the issue in question in its case-in-chief, (e) the importance of the issue on which the further evidence is sought to be adduced to the pleaded issues in the case, (f) the degree of relevance and probative value of the further evidence sought to be adduced and its potential to involve an undue waste of time, (g) the prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs,   the consideration of fairness that the defendant is entitled to know all of the evidence he has to meet in taking forensic decisions as to cross-examination and the nature and extent of the evidence he will himself adduce on the matters in question, (d) the extent to which the plaintiff has embarked upon calling evidence on the issue in question in its case-in-chief, (e) the importance of the issue on which the further evidence is sought to be adduced to the pleaded issues in the case, (f) the degree of relevance and probative value of the further evidence sought to be adduced and its potential to involve an undue waste of time, (g) the prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs,   the extent to which the plaintiff has embarked upon calling evidence on the issue in question in its case-in-chief, (e) the importance of the issue on which the further evidence is sought to be adduced to the pleaded issues in the case, (f) the degree of relevance and probative value of the further evidence sought to be adduced and its potential to involve an undue waste of time, (g) the prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs,   the importance of the issue on which the further evidence is sought to be adduced to the pleaded issues in the case, (f) the degree of relevance and probative value of the further evidence sought to be adduced and its potential to involve an undue waste of time, (g) the prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs,   the degree of relevance and probative value of the further evidence sought to be adduced and its potential to involve an undue waste of time, (g) the prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs,   the prejudice to the defendant in terms of delay in the completion of the proceeding and the consequential costs,   the public interest in the timely conclusion of litigation, and   what explanation is offered by the plaintiff for not having called the evidence in-chief.
also, sweep & sweep (no 2) [2018] famcafc 228 at paragraph 47 also assists the court
proper regard must be had to any prejudice to the other party (gaspaldi & gaspaldi [2008] famcafc 134. this includes the strain the litigation imposes on litigants. stephens also demonstrates at [273] that the impact on court resources and prejudice to other litigants waiting to be heard may also be relevant considerations. the list is not exhaustive, but gives the flavour of how variable the considerations were to a judge in the position of the primary judge when asked to re-open the hearing.   per original)
