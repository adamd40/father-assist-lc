what are the parties’ property and superannuation interests?
first, it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. so much follows from the text of section 79(1)(a) itself, which refers to “altering” the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property ... the question posed by section 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order.

why do the parties ask the court to make a property adjustment order?
what were the direct and indirect financial and direct and indirect non-financial contributions of the parties and how should the court assess them?  there was a six-month separation between late 1998 and mid-1999 when the de facto wife had primary care of two children in either the sydney or town f area,[10] (b) there was about a nine-month separation sometime between early 2005 and mid-late 2006 when the de facto wife had primary care of the three children firstly in the sydney area and then at town g, south australia,[11] (c) there was at least a two-year separation sometime between 2009 and 2012 when the de facto wife had primary care of the three children in town c,[12] and (d) post-separation only one of the children was still under the age of eighteen years, having just turned 16 years of age in 2020.[13] that child has remained living with the de facto wife.[14]   there was about a nine-month separation sometime between early 2005 and mid-late 2006 when the de facto wife had primary care of the three children firstly in the sydney area and then at town g, south australia,[11] (c) there was at least a two-year separation sometime between 2009 and 2012 when the de facto wife had primary care of the three children in town c,[12] and (d) post-separation only one of the children was still under the age of eighteen years, having just turned 16 years of age in 2020.[13] that child has remained living with the de facto wife.[14]   there was at least a two-year separation sometime between 2009 and 2012 when the de facto wife had primary care of the three children in town c,[12] and (d) post-separation only one of the children was still under the age of eighteen years, having just turned 16 years of age in 2020.[13] that child has remained living with the de facto wife.[14]   post-separation only one of the children was still under the age of eighteen years, having just turned 16 years of age in 2020.[13] that child has remained living with the de facto wife.[14]
the central question raised by this appeal is how a judge takes into account the contributions of one party, found to have been made significantly more arduous by the conduct of the other, when assessing contributions under ss79(4)(a)-(c) or ss 90sm(4)(a)-(c) of the act. the answer is the primary judge must take a holistic approach. the contributions which have been made significantly more arduous have to be weighed along with all other contributions by each of the parties, whether financial or non-financial, direct or indirect to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of property and in the role of homemaker and parent. all contributions must be weighed collectively and so it is an error to segment or compartmentalise the various contributions and weigh one against the remainder (citations omitted).  t should now be clear that the required nexus between proven family violence and the significant adverse effect upon the contributions of the victim is capable of being inferred from the lay evidence of the parties... the court is then required to examine the matters set out at s 90sf(3) as to whether those matters point to an adjustment of the property. finally, the court is again to examine whether the result arrived at constitutes a just and equitable settlement of the property.   rather than agree that he had poured a bucket of water over the de facto wife’s head during an argument about renovations in their home at the town g property, he said he had “purposefully spilt water on her” to stop her entering or staying in the room where he apprehended her feet would be cut from broken tiles, (b) in denying specific allegations related to him engaging in physical abuse of the de facto wife in front of mx d at the time of the first separation, the de facto husband refuted all the allegations put to him,[21] saying words to the effect of “we had plenty of big barney arguments, but i was not violent towards her (the de facto wife)” and “i was not in a happy place.” (c) denying he was ever abusive towards the de facto wife in front of any of the children but then, sending a text message to two of the parties’ children in early 2021 acknowledging my actions have affected the family, (d) saying that “at times” he was “rude” to the de facto wife but then appearing to deflect blame to both parties saying that he gave “as good as i got” (including calling the de facto wife “a fat bitch”), (e) proceeding to give uninvited evidence about the de facto wife calling him a “psycho fuck” which, from the overall presentation of his evidence, appeared (in part if not in full) to justify the various allegations made against him both by the de facto wife and his own daughter.   in denying specific allegations related to him
