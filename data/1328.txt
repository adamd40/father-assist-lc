introduction
current circumstances
background
the evidence
the issues
the family report
i guess i was a little affronted by the response to my report, and that he didn't agree with some aspects of it. but i guess people have different opinions...
...she was the primary attachment figure of the children in their early childhood, and therefore that has had a rupture and needs a level of repair. and that’s maximised through living with the mother.
the legal principles
consideration
are the children at risk of harm arising from family violence, abuse or neglect in the care of the parties or mr b?
are each of the parties able to promote a meaningful relationship with the other party?
what are the children’s relationships with each of the parties and other significant persons?
very serious and may result in very significant negative developmental consequences. the writer is aware that the attachment of the primary carer and child relationship is the breeding ground for the child’s brain growth and development and mental health. [5]
i guess for me attachment starts in those first five years of a child's life, and so that's often a more significant period of time about that relationship that that has with the primary parent.
i can only relate to the time when i saw the children. and so, from my observation, the excitement of spending time and seeing their mother would indicate that that was a strong attachment.
the extent of each parties’ capacity to meet the children’s needs –
the writer was left wondering if [mr garin]’s limited engagement during this session was reflective of the family environment. the writer is aware that [mr garin] works full time, and that [ms dd] is involved in the morning and school routines.... taking [y] to counselling and that [mr garin]’s mother transports the children to and from the contact arrangements between the children and their mother.[11]
i’ve got [2 years] old up to 19 years old – every one of my children brush their teeth, my girls take their medicine that they need to take, and each and every child comes and gives us a kiss and a cuddle goodnight, and we tell them we love them every day and every night.
but the glory of my job and career – i rise at 4am every morning so i don’t bother my children and if i have a spare hour in the morning i help with ironing, make the lunch. so, wherever i can tie in, i will tie in to help. because that to me is a privilege as a father.
i watched her grow into a young girl, from waking up with panic attacks and scared to go into classrooms, now she walks in and she lights up the room... ...[y] for a period of time would wake up with these panic attacks - she would run up and down the hallway and cry and i would sit with her and talk to her about culture and spirit and i would breathe life into her so she would remember where she was and i would hold her in my arms, and now, she walks in and she’s the star of the show.
...first came home to me, he would cry in the bed and all i could do was hold him and because he was so young he couldn’t process what was going on. he would cry himself to sleep. it would happen for a period of time. when he got to the point of pre-school and challenges where he had to step out of his comfort zone, i had to remind him i would always come back...
counsel: ...there are also a lot of children in the father’s household. i think on my count there are about six, ranging in age from about 18, going down to newborn and there’s another child on the way. now, the evidence suggests that in the father’s household they manage that by quite a good system of routine, and everyone pulling their weight, so to speak. do you think however, that because there are so many children and people vying for attention in the father’s household, that [x] and [y] might feel at times their needs aren’t being met? cce: ...one of the interesting things about a large family composition is the positives and negatives of that. so, the positives is that the siblings can provide support to each other, and can, you know, strengthen a child’s relationship to other children. but in terms of time, it’s a very fair thing to believe that time is divided between that number of children, and therefore the time – direct time with each child is undoubtedly less than it would be in a smaller-children household.
what are the children’s expressed views, and how much weight should they be afforded?
simple fact that he's attached to her, he loves her and was not seeing enough of her.
what is the likely effect of any changes in the children’s circumstances?
the accumulation of adverse childhood experiences in a child's developmental years increases the likelihood of long-lasting impacts on a social, emotional, and behavioural development and health incomes in the years to come.[20]
what orders will ensure that the children maintain a connection to their culture?
conclusion –
with whom the children shall live
should the injunctive orders as to mr b remain
is some cause for concern as there is no evidence before me as to the evidence the mother has filed in those proceedings to ground such orders.
