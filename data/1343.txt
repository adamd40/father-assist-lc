legal principles
in relation to the first stage, in our view, when considering whether to exercise the power under s 79 and 80(1)(h) of the act to make an interim property order the “overarching consideration” is the interests of justice. it is not necessary to establish compelling circumstances. all that is required is that in the circumstances it is appropriate to exercise the power. in exercising the wide and unfettered discretion conferred by the power to make such an order, regard should be had to the fact that the usual order pursuant to s 79 is a once and for all order made after a final hearing.
in relation to the second matter, as the jurisdiction under s 79 of the act is being exercised the provision of that section must be considered and applied but with limitations given that it is not the final hearing. there is also no requirement of compelling circumstances in relation to the substantive step.
consideration
should an order be made for the sale of the former matrimonial home and/or the suburb e property?
