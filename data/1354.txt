reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction n my assessment, [ms roswell]’s overall credibility in the case is unassailed and [ms roswell]’s case remained one of unfounded speculation and innuendo. essentially, [mr roswell] believes that because he worked so hard, for such a lengthy period of time, during which many properties and motor vehicles were purchased, the parties must be better off now and therefore the only explanation that they are not is that someone has stolen from him. in my view, although i do not doubt the strong emotional attachment of [mr roswell] to his theory, he has provided no concrete evidence to support it. [i]t is abundantly clear to me that [mr roswell] has been resistant to the expeditious resolution of these proceedings. the most rational explanation, certainly that proffered by [mr roswell], for this conduct has been that he wishes to inflict financial damage on [mr roswell]. however, whether [mr roswell] is motivated by some such explicable form of motivation or is just, in some other way, stuck and so unable to move on in a manner which is of assistance not only to him but his former partners, is impossible for me to say. all that has to be said, at this juncture, is that [mr roswell] was by far the more reliable witness in the proceedings and she has clearly done all that was in her power to bring them to a conclusion. the same cannot be said of [mr roswell], whose case has been characterised by delay, withdrawal and then re-appointment of his legal advice, apparent settlement, which is subsequently repudiated, fruitless attempts to subpoena documents, which are then not relied upon, and most significantly inchoate and subsequently unsubstantiated claims of financial impropriety. [4]
accordingly, the parties’ respective legal costs do not seem to be radically disparate and each has funded them from monies available to them. as such, the proceedings have been ruinously expensive for each of them. in these circumstances, i will approach the sums of money advanced by [mr s], aunt [ms m] and [ms z] not as debts due to each of the parties and so requiring to be set off against the parties’ joint assets. in the circumstances of this case, i do not think such a straight dollar for dollar add back of the sums concerned would be just and equitable given that there can be comprehensive and accurate accounting of all the sums of money accessed by the parties in respect of legal costs and each appears to have utilised joint funds to this end. as previously indicated, the wife has foreshadowed that she intends to make an application for indemnity costs in an amount of $75,000.00 together with the unspecified amount incurred for in respect of the recently concluded trial. i am not in a position, for obvious reasons, to deal with such an application before it is made, but am concerned at the potential for injustice to arise if the wife, on the one hand, receives a greater proportion of the parties’ assets on account of the husband’s general dereliction in pursuing these proceedings and then also is granted an additional award of costs. [5]
these proceedings have been significantly protracted and highly controversial. as a consequence each of the parties concerned has incurred very significant legal costs, the full extent of which remain inchoate. what is clear is that they have been largely sourced from the parties’ joint funds. in [ms roswell]’s case, she would characterise some of the monies used to pay her legal fees as being loans - $10,000.00 to [mr s], $10,000.00 to [ms z], and approximately $45,000.00 in effect borrowed from herself in the form of the money gifted to her by aunt [ms m]. for reasons already provided, i do not consider that it would be just and equitable to regard these as joint debts given [mr roswell] has also incurred significant legal fees. in addition, although it is likely to be the case that [mr roswell] has utilised more of the parties’ joint funds, post separation, chiefly because she was in control of the assets controlled by the family trust, it is clear to me that she had by far the greater level of financial need. in addition, her efforts have resulted in the preservation of assets, which has benefitted [mr roswell]. more significantly, i am satisfied that the manner in which [mr roswell] elected to approach the proceedings has led to their marked protraction. this in turn has resulted in [mr roswell] incurring more expense. in my assessment, in general terms, these are factors which must be taken into account as favouring [mr roswell].[6]
the current application
this procedure, known as the calderbank letter or offer, was first used in matrimonial cases, but is now recognised to be of general application. the consequence of marking an offer “without prejudice save as to costs” is that the document and its contents are treated as being without prejudice for the determination of the substantial issues between the parties – they are privileged. but they may be used after these issues are determined, for the purpose of deciding the incidence of costs. where the payment into court procedure is available, it is prudent that it be used.[9]
in exercising the discretion to award costs in a civil proceeding, the federal circuit and family court of australia (division 2) or a judge must take account of any failure to comply with the duty imposed by subsection (1) or (2).
legal principles applicable
a proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes cross-proceedings or an incidental proceeding in the course of or in connexion with a proceedings.
section 117 confers upon the court a broad discretion in relation to costs. that discretion is one which the court should not seek to fetter. as was pointed out by the high court in penfold v penfold:
it is an accurate description of s 117(1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the subsection is not paramount to s 117(2). as subs (1) is expressed to be subject to subs (2), the former must yield whenever a judge finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. subsection (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs (citations removed).[15]
the court should not depart lightly from the ordinary rules relating to costs between party and party and the circumstances justifying the departure should be of an exceptional kind.[17]
it is frequently the case that litigants in family law proceedings have no personal experience of the court system or in dealing with legal professionals. a case involving division of marital property or arrangements for children may be the first time they have ever even entered a courtroom. necessarily such cases are replete with emotion and, as such, do not enable the individuals concerned to exercise dispassionate judgment about the issues raised, and the cost, both in emotional and financial terms, of pursing their preferred outcome.[18]
...now, just in short, i had to pursue what i knew was wrong because i had brought my abilities to the business, and i taught [ms roswell] what how was – how the billing structure and the cost structure of our business was. now, i have pursued this external to the court, because i feel this is not my realm, and i have pursued it through the ato investigating, and i have pursued it through the federal government, and now it is in the hands of the treasury. hopefully, things will came back and you will be sitting at the bench to undo whoopsies done.
we recognise that the rules now expressly refer to orders for costs on an indemnity basis. we recognise also that the rules in this court are not precisely the same as those in other courts, however, there is nothing in the rules which indicates that the fundamental principle applied in other jurisdictions should not also be applied in this jurisdiction. indeed rule 19.18[24] makes clear that the “default” position is that costs are awarded on a party/party basis.[25]
discussion
the financial circumstances of the parties
receipt of legal aid
conduct of the parties
the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters.[27]
failure to comply with previous orders
party wholly unsuccessful
offers to settle in writing
we think that whilst s 117(2a) does not provide any direct guidance to where weight should be given in any one particular case, it is very important for the court to give proper consideration to written offers of settlement that have been made. the insertion of s 117c into the legislation is a clear indication of the desire of parliament to enable parties to avoid unnecessary litigation by indicating to the other party an appropriate basis upon which litigation can be settled. the failure to heed a reasonable offer in circumstances where there is adequate knowledge of the parties at the time the offer is made to give it a proper consideration, is something to which very significant weight indeed ought normally be given. it is clearly a circumstance that would justify the making of an order for costs in favour of the husband.[29]
“...it is not the law that an offer of greater or equivalent value to that which results from the court will lead to an order for costs in favour of the offeror... we would also add that just because an offer is marginally less than the amount ordered by a court does not mean that it is not a factor to be taken into account in determining whether costs should be awarded... the plain words [of section 117(2a)(f)] do not limit a court’s attention to offers which are greater than the amount awarded. nor does the paragraph state what consequences flow from whether the offer is greater or lesser than the amount awarded, or how much that is the case. words of limitation should not be imported into the provision and nor should it be read as though offers in proceedings under the act carry the same consequences as payment into court in common law matters. we do however, consider that the closer the offer is to the award when the offer is under the amount awarded by the court, the more weight should be given to this factor in considering the question of costs. the principle must not, however, be rigidly applied. offers must be seen within the context of the case and the extent of the offeree’s knowledge of the parties’ financial circumstances while the offer is live. in the family law jurisdiction, it is not uncommon to find relationships where one party, often the wife, has significantly less grasp of the parties’ financial arrangements, or the financial circumstances are so complex that if would be premature to accept an offer. there are also cases where the contents of the offer are in themselves the subject of disputed value and legitimate subject matter for determination. these and other features of the context of offers must be taken into account when considering whether it was reasonable or not to accept an offer, no matter how close to the ultimate result the offer may be.” [31]
