1. the husband pay to the wife the sum of $800,000 (the payment) as follows: ... (b) $400,000 by 4:00 pm on 7 june 2023 (the second instalment). (emphasis in original)
6. pending the [suburb c] transfer and the [suburb c] discharge: ... (e) the husband pay all rates, taxes and outgoings including utilities due and payable with respect to [suburb c].
4. the parties do forthwith do all acts and things and sign all documents as may be required to transfer to the wife, at the expense of the wife, all of the husband’s right, title and interest in the property at [b street, suburb c] ([suburb c]), free of all encumbrance (the [suburb c] transfer). 5. contemporaneously with the [suburb c] transfer, the parties do all acts and things and sign all documents for the husband to discharge the commonwealth bank of australia (cba) mortgage registered number [...] secured by [suburb c], so as to release the wife from any and all payment and liability thereunder, including to release the wife from any and all personal guarantees provided by her in relation to [suburb c] or any real property to be retained by the husband pursuant to these orders, and provide confirmation of such release (the [suburb c] discharge). (emphasis in original)   in relation to count two, that a contravention be recorded, the payment of $13,320 plus interest “as detailed in the applicant’s contravention application”[2] (which it is not), and (b) in relation to count three, that the contravention be recorded and the respondent pay outstanding balances up until 27 march 2023 including any interest and penalties applied by council and relevant services.[3]   in relation to count three, that the contravention be recorded and the respondent pay outstanding balances up until 27 march 2023 including any interest and penalties applied by council and relevant services.[3]
count two  $94.10 of the unpaid amount was on account of the wife’s conveyancing expenses[8], (b) $13,320 was on account of potential administrative[9] penalty from the australian tax office on account of an unlawful withdrawal from a self-managed superannuation fund bank account said to be in breach of various regulatory provisions (comprising both legislation and regulation) referred to collectively as superannuation regulations.   $13,320 was on account of potential administrative[9] penalty from the australian tax office on account of an unlawful withdrawal from a self-managed superannuation fund bank account said to be in breach of various regulatory provisions (comprising both legislation and regulation) referred to collectively as superannuation regulations.
19. after giving effect to the foregoing paragraph [which provided for the wife to leave the fund and leaves the control of it’s trustee in the hands of the respondent husband], the husband be liable for and indemnify the wife absolutely in relation to the trustee and the fund, for all liabilities, whether past present or future including but not limited to taxation liabilities or penalties. 20. pending the superannuation split, each party be and is hereby restrained from dealing with, charging, encumbering or disposing of any property of the fund, other than in accordance with the terms of this order.
as such, until it is clear there will not be any action taken in response to the reportable contravention and penalties issued, our client intends to withhold the amount of $13,320 from the final payment due to your client for a period of 12 months from the date the reportable contravention is made. if no notice of action to be taken is received by that time, our client will pay the further amount to your client.[13]   having considered whether to make an application to the court to vary the orders to include provision for him to withhold $13,320 from ms alessi’s [ie the applicant’s] final payment and determining not to do so on account of costs and delay, he was then hoping the matter would resolve by agreement,[16] and (b) as he had no means to recover funds from the applicant wife should the australian taxation office impose an administrative penalty, the most practical and cost-effective way to deal with the situation was to withhold funds from the applicant wife and defer payment for a reasonable period to see if the australian taxation office took any action.[17]   as he had no means to recover funds from the applicant wife should the australian taxation office impose an administrative penalty, the most practical and cost-effective way to deal with the situation was to withhold funds from the applicant wife and defer payment for a reasonable period to see if the australian taxation office took any action.[17]
the husband submits it is unjust if the ato [ie the australian taxation office] were to impose a penalty upon him, as sole director of the trustee, as a result of the wife’s deliberate impropriety. in those circumstances, the husband contends he had reasonable excuse to withhold the amount from the payment due to the wife pursuant to the final orders pending the completion and lodgement of the tax returns for the smsf [ie self-managed superannuation fund of the parties] for the financial year ending 30 june 2023, and pending the issue of any penalty notice by the ato.[18]
