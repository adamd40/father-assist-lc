balance sheet findings
items 22 to 27: notional add backs
...when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion — usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.

items 35: the country d pension fund
...it appears you have not made the necessary contribution to receive any pension payments when you reach your retirement age of 67 years because from the periods shown on page 5 of your letter dated 8 september 2022, it appears you have not contributed for the minimum period of 60 months... the figures on page 3 of the letter show your remuneration for the relevant periods. these are figures on which the calculation of your contributions to the [country d] pension fund are based and are comparable to ote amounts used for the calculation of superannuation contributions. they do not amount to something like superannuation account balance.[17]

adjustment to the contribution findings
just and equitable
there is no reason for my client to be loaded up with a ...super pool asset adjustment and for the wife to be loaded up with cash, again just to achieve her outcome... her outcome of this is really just pitched on a capacity to refinance. it’s appropriate in those circumstances to make an order which has an equal adjustment of super, given the manner in which both parties came into the relationship with superannuation.
