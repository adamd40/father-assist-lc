the history of the children and their relationships the children have lived in an equal share care arrangement since the parents separated in 2016, when [x] and [y] were six and three years of age respectively. the children were interviewed together and separately, while at the home of their mother. they impressed as articulate and mature for their age. they both willing engaged in discussion about their schooling and current living arrangements. [x] identified as being “sporty”, and said that she participates in [various sports]. [x] said that she is looking forward to commencing high school because she has difficulty making friends, and she is “looking forward to making true friends.” the parents reported that [x has a number of illnesses]). the mother said that [x] has a diagnosed stress disorder. [x] said that she is “picked on” by other students, because of her [...] allergies and that, “i spend most of my time trying to fit in.” she said that her mother mostly helps her to manage her allergies and that her father is aware of what is required, but, in relation to her health concerns, [x] noted that her parents “don’t agree on things.” [x] said that her parents are “going to court because they don’t agree on anything” and are “completely different people.” she expressed the view that “i am mature for my age and can do things for myself, and they try to protect me too much.” [x] noted that she has requested of her parents, greater independence and more responsibility, and that “at dad’s i feel too responsible because i am the oldest, and at mum’s i feel too childlike and don’t have enough support to become a young adult.” [x] described positive relationships with both parents saying, “i feel safe here [at her mother’s] and safe at dad’s.” she said that, at her mother’s, she likes that they sit down, they read a book, and her mother asks her about her day. at her father’s, [x] likes spending time with her stepsiblings, and noted, “dad owes me a dog because mine passed away last year.” reflecting on living with step-siblings, [x] said that she does not consider her father’s house her home, because “i am jealous and i don’t like sharing” with the other children. she said that she and [y] “bicker over things, because we are siblings.” she said that she likes the week about arrangement because she is able to spend equal time with both parents, but noted that [y] is “snappy” on the first day “because she does not like change.” the parents commented that [x] demonstrates leadership qualities and “likes to organise everybody.” of herself, [x] said, “i am naturally determined and loyal and can be stubborn and bossy, i like taking control, and i am an extravert and need to be around people.” [x] described her parents’ different personalities, saying that her mother was “chilly, relaxed, and determined”, and that her parenting style was to “make sure we feel included and have a say.” she said that her father is “a strong extravert like me” and his parenting style is to “tell us” what to do and “tricks” her and [y] into doing things. she said that her father is also, “caring and can read my emotions”, and that she and her father are “doers.” [x] said that she has no worries or concerns. she is aware of her parents “fighting” because “i have been told” about the dispute, and “they both look angry and upset when checking their emails and they don’t text each other.” [x]’s wishes for her family included for her parents to “get along, i want less verbal violence between everyone, and i want my sister to realise how important it is [for us] to stay together, mum and dad won’t always be there, but i want [y] to always be there.” [y] presented as calm, and relaxed, though animated and engaged in her speech. she participates in [sports], and stated that she does not like [one sport] and prefers [the other]. the parents reported that [y] has been identified as gifted and talented, is in the top one percent for science and maths, and with an “introverted” personality. [y] attends [an] extension program out of school. the mother said that [y] is bullied at school, and called names, such as [...] “nerd”. she stated that often [x] has intervened to support [y] and that [y] is not looking forward to next year when [x] goes to high school. the mother would like [y] to change school, so she would not be bullied and to have greater academic challenges and opportunities. she said that there is a “[an] extension” program at [dd] school and she has looked at [ee school]. the father considered the social aspect of school as equally important and, at this time, would like [y] to remain at her current school, where she has established peer friendships. in relation to her schooling, [y] said that she likes all her subjects, but not physical education. [y] commented that she likes learning but she is “bored” with her schoolwork because “i have read it all before”. however, she said that, at school, she has “good friends, and i like that.” [y] understood the competing factors in the choice of a school, and stated that she would like to go to a school “where i learnt something, but i want to stay [at [ff school]] because of my friends.” [y] described a positive relationship with both her parents. she said that, with her mother, she enjoys that they sit down, or while in bed, and talk together about a range of topics. she also likes having a room of her own at her mother’s home. [y] said that she feels sad and frightened, when [mr n] [...] “yells at me.” she said that [mr n], who is [...] her stepfather, worries about her mother because the mother has [a medical condition] and, when her mother has extreme pain, “he gets angry and i don’t like it.” [y] said that, when [mr n] is angry, she goes to her bedroom, shuts the door and cries. she said that, if she is frightened or worried, she prefers to talk to [x] or her mother. [y] said that, with her father, she enjoys having more people with whom to play, the space in the house, and the “giant backyard.” [y] said that she likes to follow routines and this is challenging when it comes to “swapping houses”, and she becomes “a little stressed out” on friday night before changeover on saturday. she seemed to manage the differences between her parents’ approaches to living. she said that the routines are different at each of her parents’ homes and that these routines “fit for that house.” [y] said that the current arrangements are “going fine”, and she would not like to live in one home because she wants to spend time with both parents. the parents reported that [y] has been displaying some [medical] symptoms and that she requires testing for [allergies]. [y] did not mention any of these issues during the meeting. [y]’s wishes for her family included that her mother and father were back together, that they were not “fighting”, and that she would be the oldest child because “you can help the other children, and you get a later bed time.” the father said that the mother identifies as [of country gg heritage] and with the catholic faith and he is satisfied with the children attending faith-based activities. the mother stated that “faith is a big thing for them [the children]”, the children have attended the mass all their lives, this year [x] had her confirmation and [y] her first communion, and that [x] is a “fairly devout” catholic. she believes that the father is not supportive of the children’s involvement their various catholic activities and has said that the children are being “brainwashed.” the father stated that he is from a blended family and acknowledge that this has challenges. in addition, he said that there are often arguments between [x] and [y]. the father stated that he and his partner attended a counsellor for assistance to help the children all feel like they belong. he believes that the children know he will help them to sort out any sibling tensions and he coaches them around their reactions to one another. child impact analysis risk and harm considerations the mother said that she suffers with [medical conditions]. she said that, a flaring of her symptoms of fatigue and pain, are stress related and, to lessen her symptoms, she needs to reduce her stress. in her comments and presentation, the mother impressed that she finds the parental dispute as the major source of her stress. the level of stress expressed by the mother suggests that her mental health may be an issue, which could negatively affect her parenting. children can be prone to developing anxiety when experiencing this in a parent. consequently, spending equal time with their father may be protective of the children’s emotional wellbeing. the mother said that, although there was no physical violence towards her by the father, the father is psychologically controlling until she “gives in.” she said that she does not like conflict and the children being upset, and that she has “extreme anxiety about being near him [the father]”. she said that she did not attend [x]’s year 6 graduation because it was “too stressful” to be near the father. she alleged that [x] has expressed the view, “daddy doesn’t see you, it is like you are dead.” the mother spoke at length about [x]’s multiple allergies, which she believes are not being managed satisfactorily, because [x] has [a medical symptom] every day and has frequent [medical] episodes [...]. she believes that the father does not take these issues seriously, for example, [x] got cross-contamination from food at the father’s home and came home vomiting. she also alleged that [x] had [42] days absence from school in 2021, most of which occurred when she was in the father’s care. harmful conflict considerations the father reported a positive and cooperative co-parenting relationship with the mother until 2020. the mother said that the parents had a difficult relationship both pre and post separation, and that the level of conflict does affect the children. she believes that the father is controlling and that “you never know when something will change”, and that they make agreements and then the father changes the arrangements. she said that she gives the father notice of any school events, which are also on the school app, and that he keeps saying, “i don’t tell him.” currently, the parents seem to struggle to communicate effectively and decisions regarding the children’s health and education appear drawn out. the mother believes that she makes suggestions regarding the children’s wellbeing, with which the father will not agree and cooperate. for example, the mother alleged that the father “shut down” counselling for [x] and that enrolling [x] in [sports] “was a fight” because the father believed this activity was “inconvenient.” she alleged that, during mediation, the father stated that “he would make me beg, and he was here to punish me”, following which the mediator terminated the mediation. the mother considers that father is good at “the fun stuff” with the children but does not follow through on health and educational matters, for example, that he did not enforce the children’s study over the lockdown period when the children were doing home schooling. the mother said that she is seeking sole parental responsibility for the children because she wants to make decisions and “move on”, and for the children “to get the treatment they need.” for example, she said that the parents were in disagreement about the high school [x] would attend for two years, [y] needs [a medical procedure] but the father will not agree, and that, when it was recommended [x] see a child psychologist, the father would not agree to any of the three options, which she presented. the father believes that the mother worries excessively about the children and becomes anxious when she cannot control risk and imposes expectations of his parenting to reduce her anxiety. he reported that, following the meetings with the children for this report, he received and email from the mother stating that, in order to resolve the current dispute, she would move to queensland. he said that the level of stress in the co-parenting relationship is “disappointing.” while the parental dispute does not involve overt conflict, the children are well aware of the parents’ disagreements. the children have been living in an equal shared care arrangement with their parents for five years, they are familiar with the routines, and seem satisfied with the current arrangements. although both children demonstrated a mature understanding to the family structure and their parents’ individual characteristics, the parental conflict may negatively affect the children’s emotional wellbeing and their experience of their family relationships. the current week about arrangement appears to give the children some certainty and stability and there is a concern this stability may be threatened if there is greater complexity to the arrangements. developmental considerations ... [x] is of an age when she is seeking greater independence and autonomy from her parents. thus, the mother’s approach to parenting may not align well with [x]’s developmental needs. [y] needs consistency and routine. it seems that the children are aware of the conflict between the parents. in addition, [y] reported distress in relation to her stepfather yelling at her mother. [x] and [y] may experience difficulties navigating their developmental tasks if they continue to be exposed to the parental dispute. the mother’s proposal for the children to live primarily with her would increase the number of transition for the children and may lead to greater instability in the care arrangements. in addition, the proposed times vary for each of the children and are dependent on each of their extracurricular activities, which may vary, and this is likely to create unnecessary confusion and lead to greater conflict between the parents. ... parental understanding of the children’s needs the father demonstrated an appreciation of the children’s developmental needs. he stated that the mother worries about monitoring [x]’s health in “micro detail” and has set expectations around what will happen when the children are in his care. the father believes [x] is of an age, when she needs to begin taking responsibility for managing her [...] allergies. of [y]’s schooling, he said that he does not over-emphasis the academic as “all important”, over the social aspects of school, and is of the view that, as [y] struggles with change, she would find a change of school difficult. he said that, to improve [y]’s confidence and social skills, he enrolled her in [extracurricular classes], and she is enjoying the activity. the father believes that the children are satisfied with the current arrangements and like the structure. he said that he does not think the children are aware of the mother’s application to change the care arrangements, and believes that they would be distressed if they knew. while it appears the mother has the children’s best interests at heart, it seems that the mother’s anxiety permeates and taints her view of the children’s needs. as stated previously this could negatively affect her capacity to anticipate the children’s needs as they mature. key considerations and opportunities for resolution the primary need of the children is for the parental conflict to end. the parents need to consider how they can better communicate and cooperate in relation to the wellbeing and development of the children. they may benefit from attending the [hh program] at [jj service]. the mother may need to work with her counsellor on strategies to reduce her anxiety. given the poor communication and cooperation between the parents, it is in the best interest of the children, that there are prescriptive orders specifying time spending arrangements, during term and school holiday periods. given the children’s views and the information available for this limited and preliminary assessment it does not seem the children would benefit from a change of care arrangements at this time.
written submissions on behalf of the applicant
orders sought by the father the father seeks final orders in accordance with the minute of order annexed hereto. treatment of [dr b]’s report the report of [dr b] and her answers to questions rendered on behalf of the mother were tendered into evidence at the outset of the trial. thereafter, and prior to [dr b] being cross-examined in relation to her report and the opinions and recommendations expressed therein, [dr b]’s registration was suspended. on 19 october 2023, the court made orders discharging [dr b] as the court appointed single expert. an order was further made that her reports may only be used for comparative purposes, and not as primary evidence, nor to contradict the primary evidence of the parties in these proceedings. whilst not seeking to cavil with the orders of 19 october 2023, it is submitted that so much of the reports as records the statements of the children and/or the parties (save to the extent that the parties deny a statement attributed to them, although this does not appear to be an issue in the present case) can be utilised in evidence. it is otherwise contended that there is sufficient evidence before the court from the parties and the child impact report (cir) of [ms s] which will enable the court to satisfactorily determine the matter. background the parties commenced a relationship in 2005 and commenced cohabitation in or about 2006. they never married. they separated on a final basis in or about august/september 2016, when [x] and [y] were aged 6 and 3 years respectively. shortly after separation, the parties agreed and thereafter implemented a parenting plan for the children which provided that they were to live with the parties on a week about basis [f. 30]. it was the father’s evidence that the parties were able to implement the equal time arrangements with relative success until about 2020 when relations between the parties began to break down and conflict between them increased, such that by october 2020 the father had engaged a family lawyer and the mother threatened court proceedings for parenting orders [f. 34, 36(a)]. thereafter, the parties attended mediation with [j centre] in [early] 2021 and with [ms k] in [early] 2021. at the latter mediation, the parties were able to reach agreement as to some but not all matters although the mother failed to execute consent orders (as sought by the father) reflecting those matters which were agreed [f. 36]. at trial, the father gave evidence as to his view as to the cause of the breakdown of the co-parenting relationship. it was the mother’s contention, however, that the equal time arrangement was never successful. it is submitted that the court would prefer the father’s evidence in this regard particularly in circumstances where, at least until 2020, she took no steps to bring an end to the equal time arrangement. the father commenced proceedings by way of an initiating application filed 30 july 2021, proposing orders for equal shared parental responsibility, a continuation of the week about equal time arrangement and defined orders with respect to school holidays and special days. by her response filed 17 september 2021, the mother sought sole parental responsibility, that the children live with her and spend time with the father 2 nights per fortnight during school terms and in school holidays. a cir was ordered on 27 september 2021. [in] december 2021, the parties and children attended upon [ms s] for the purpose of that assessment and her report was dated 22 december 2021 (ex. mf1). following the interview [in late] 2021, the mother informed the father of her intention to move to queensland [f. 40]. this coincided with the father informing the mother that he and his then partner, [ms h], were intending to take the children [away] between christmas and new years [f. 45]. in her oral evidence, the mother confirmed that the decision to move was made [in early] 2021 following the interviews with [ms s] and the decision relayed to the father and the children that day. the mother then moved to queensland [in early] 2022 [f. 12] at which time the children transitioned into the full-time care of the father. whilst there is no doubt that it is the mother’s right to live wherever she may choose, it is submitted that the precipitous way that the mother set about making the move was insensitive to the children as it did not enable them the opportunity to process and adjust to this significant change which occurred in the context of a number of other significant changes in their lives, including the father commencing cohabitation with [ms h] and the children adjusting to life with stepsiblings and [x] transitioning to high school. whilst the mother’s affidavit evidence seeks to present this move as being altruistic [m. 90-91] it is submitted that the court would find the mother’s evidence in this regard to be disingenuous. in particular: (i) the court would reject the mother’s evidence that at the end of 2021, the owners of the property she was renting informed her that they were unexpectantly returning from [overseas] [m. 91(a)]. in fact, the mother has informed [ms s] that she was returning to live at the [suburb dd] property owned by her in early 2022. further, the family whose home the mother was renting was always due to return at that time. (ii) despite the mother’s claims that she was informed in late 2021 that [her employer] was unable to renew her contract as a [professional] due to financial constraints [m. 91(b)], subpoenaed records confirmed that the mother continues to be employed by that [employer] and she conceded (albeit somewhat reluctantly) that this was her main source of income. in her evidence in chief, the mother confirmed that she had received an oral offer of permanent full-time employment at [r organisation]. (iii) whilst the mother claims that the move was to reduce conflict with the father, it has been to the contrary. although stating to the father [in late] 2021 that she would sign any document he had his solicitor prepare [f.40] the mother subsequently declined to do so. the mother has also reported that the purpose of the move was to get away from the father. with this being a motivating factor in the move, it is difficult to reconcile the proposition that was put to the father in evidence that he relocate to brisbane. events of [mid-2021] the events of [mid] 2021, in which [x] left the father’s home and travelled with the mother’s husband, [mr n] to queensland are detailed by each of the parties in their respective affidavit evidence [f. 59 – 91, m. 49-60]. [in mid] 2021, the father filed an urgent application in a proceedings seeking the return of [x] to his care. pursuant to orders made following a defended hearing on 6 june 2021, x returned to the father’s care on 13 june 2023 [f. 91]. it is submitted that the court would find that the mother’s conduct in relation to this incident reflects poorly on her parenting capacity. the mother encouraged [x], then 12 years old, to leave the father’s home after dark and go to the park where she was collected by the mother’s friend. the mother knew the front door remained open and [y] (as well as 2 other children) were asleep in an unsecured house. the mother chose to not inform the father that [x] had left the home, instead leaving him to awake to find [x] gone. it is submitted that the court would be satisfied having regard in particular to the messages exchanged between the mother and [x] that the mother orchestrated, or in the alternative at the very least encouraged, [x]’s conduct. the text message exchange between the mother and [x] reveal that [x] was intending to return to the father’s care [in mid] 2022 only to be told by the mother “[mr n] will be there in a few hours” and “just wait a second please. i’ll talk to you shortly. trust me”. when [x] asks the mother whether she had told the father she was going to queensland the mother responded “in two minutes” with a laughing emoji followed by a direction to [x] to block the father’s number until the following day. the decision to allow [mr n] to transport [x] from [city d] was destabilising for both [x] and [y]. it resulted in [x] being absent from school for a period exceeding a month, the siblings being separated and [y] likely feeling further abandoned by the mother. the mother’s conduct could only be described as strategic rather than protective. parental responsibility the father’s proposal at the commencement of trial was for an order for equal shared parental responsibility, whereas the mother sought orders for sole parental responsibility in the event the children lived in brisbane (which it is submitted amounts to a concession on her behalf as to a lack of capacity to communicate and reach agreement with the father on major issues) or an order for equal shared parental responsibility if the children lived in [city d]. following the conclusion of evidence, the father has now amended his position to seek sole responsibility for medical, dental and allied health services subject to a requirement to consult with the mother. he proposes that all other aspects of parental responsibility be shared between the parties albeit he seeks a specific order with respect to [y]’s enrolment at high school to resolve that potential dispute16. in particular, the father seeks orders for [y] to commence high school in 2025 at [f school] where [x] attends. absent an order for high school, it is likely that the parties will not be able to reach an agreement on this issue which may lead to the institution of further proceedings which would not be in the children’s best interests. at the time of trial, [x] was not engaged with a psychologist, the reasons for which were explained by the father during cross-examination by the icl. the father confirmed that whilst he was willing to compel [x]’s attendance upon a psychologist he had not done so at that juncture due to the differing views between himself and the mother about the benefits of such support, and in particular his experience that the mother was against counselling and psychological support which the father felt undermined [x]’s perception of the value of such interventions. the parties’ position with respect to therapy in particular is diametrically opposed. the parties disagreed during the course of the proceedings as to whether therapy for [x] should be confidential and non-reportable, as to the basis as to the need for any therapeutic intervention for [x] (the mother’s belief being that it was needed as a result of a need to “rebuild” a relationship with the father), whether the parties themselves should have interaction with [dr m]22 and whether there should be family therapy (the mother having refused to participate in family therapy with the father despite her acknowledgment that their conflict was having a deleterious impact on the children). perhaps the best example of the parties’ inability to cooperate in relation to health matters concerning the children is the fact that in early 2020, the mother unilaterally removed the father from the joint health fund (coinciding with her closing the joint account where the parties deposited funds for the children’s support) and thereafter refused to provide the father with a certificate of currency in relation to their existing health fund so that he could insure them on his policy without a waiting period. it was the mother’s evidence that she refused to provide a certificate of currency because she did not believe the father had taken out a policy and questioned what that policy covered, which is representative of her level of distrust of the father. the consequence of the mother’s refusal to provide the certificate of currency is that that the children’s considerable health and therapeutic costs have fallen to the father without access to any rebate. the evidence suggests that both children have required, and will likely require specialist medical services and therapeutic assistance in the future. it is not in the best interest of either child that their access to medical / dental care or therapeutic support continues to be hampered by the parental dispute. in circumstances where the father is arranging, funding and facilitating that support (assuming of course the children remain living in [city d]), then it is appropriate that he be the parent vested with that responsibility. benefit of a meaningful relationship (s 60cc(2)(a)) it is submitted that the court would comfortably find that the children have a meaningful relationship with each of their parents to which they benefit. the main issue for determination by the court is whether the children will continue to enjoy a meaningful relationship with the father should they transition into the care of the mother. it is submitted that the court would be satisfied that should the children live with the mother, that there is an unacceptable risk that the children’s relationship with the father would be detrimentally impacted given the mother’s attitude towards the father and her propensity to expose the children to such attitude. in particular, the evidence establishes: (i) that the mother reinforced to the children that the decision for them to remain in [city d] lay at the feet of the father [f. 41 – 43], (ii) prior to her departure, the mother put in place a “safety plan” with [x] which reinforced to [x] that there was a basis to be fearful of the father and/or that she may need protection from him, (iii) the mother’s permissive attitude in allowing [x] to denigrate the father to her, which included [x] referring to the father as a “fuckwit”, (iv) confiding in [x] that she was subject to family violence by the father, such that [x] described to [dr b] that her mother had moved to brisbane to “be safe from dad”, (v) the mother’s belief (without foundation) that the father is a narcissist and suffers from a [a mental disorder]. in this context, [x]’s statement to [dr b] that “he is a narcissist and manipulative and dangerous and he’s hurt me before” implies a shared narrative between [x] and the mother. it is submitted that the court would reject the mother’s evidence that no such discussion had occurred and that [x] came to her own conclusion as to the father’s narcissism through her passionate embrace of [hobbies] and [social media], the mother’s attitude towards the father can perhaps best be encapsulated by what she told [y’s] new psychologist [in early] 2023. given the mother’s attitude to the father, it is submitted the court would be satisfied that the mother is highly unlikely to support an ongoing relationship with the children should they live with her and that she will likely seek to continue to influence the children to have a negative view of their father. the mother’s conduct in that regard may well be more successful in circumstances where the children are not enjoying regular time with the father. the need to protect the children from harm (s 60cc(2)(b)) whilst the mother makes allegations of family violence against the father, it is submitted that the court would reject the mother’s allegations. the mother’s conduct in agreeing, implementing and continuing an equal time arrangement for the children following separation and having the children move to live with the father on a full time basis in [early] 2022 when she relocated to queensland is conduct which is entirely inconsistent with the allegations she makes. it is submitted that the court would be concerned that the allegations made by the mother do not have a rational basis in fact. for example, the mother contended the father’s engagement of lawyers in relation to the current dispute was part of his campaign of harassment against her and an attempt to assert control over her (in the context of both parties agreeing that the conflict between them was heightened and mediation being initiated) and that the father continued to “gaslight” her up until the time of trial by disagreeing on medical issues for [y], refusing to accept that it may in fact just be a difference of opinion. in any event, it is submitted that the court would not be satisfied that there is a current or prospective need to protect the children from harm from exposure to abuse, neglect or family violence and that the inference to be drawn from the orders proposed by the mother is a concession on her part that the father does not pose an unacceptable risk to the children. the children’s views (s 60cc(3)(a)) there is no dispute that [x] and [y] have expressed their preference is to live in queensland with the mother. whilst [x] in particular is of an age where weight would ordinarily attach to her views, it is submitted that significant weight would not attach to the children’s stated views in the circumstances of this case given: (i) the children have been subject to manipulation by the mother, a fact of which the court would be satisfied having regard to [x]’s school counsellor records in which she disclosed, amongst other things, that she was refusing to enjoy herself or participate in family life as this could be used in court against her34, a conclusion which [x] likely only reached with either implied or overt encouragement by the mother, (ii) the evidence indicates that should the children move to live with the mother, their relationship with their father would be negatively impacted. there is no indication that the children understand that an enactment of their views would likely result in a significant diminution in their relationship with the father, and (iii) both children are happy and settled in [city d]. the father in particular gave evidence that [x]’s recent behaviour indicated contentment with her life in [city d] and that [x] had been making future plans for her life in [city d]. the father provided insightful evidence that acceding to the children’s stated views as to their living arrangements would not be the panacea that would resolve the challenges faced by the children. he identified that such a situation would result in a situation in which he did not have a relationship with the children which would create a different set of problems for them, a proposition which it is submitted the court would have no difficulty in accepting. the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and any other persons (s 60cc(3)(b)) at the time of the cir, both children spoke positively about their relationship with each of the parents. at that time, [y] spoke about feeling sad and frightened when the mother’s husband yells at her. it is submitted that the court would be satisfied that the children enjoy a good relationship with each of their parents and that whilst there have been difficulties in the paternal household at times since the mother’s relocation, these situations have been managed appropriately by the father and the situation has improved. the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues and to spend time and communicate with the child (s 60cc(3)(c)) both parents have sought to be actively involved in all aspects of the children’s lives, although the mother’s decision to make a hasty relocation to brisbane thus bringing about a significant change to the time the children could spend with her was not a decision which focussed or reflected on the children’s needs or interest. the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfill, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child (s 60cc(3)(ca)) from separation until 2021, the parties operated a joint account to which they both contributed (equally until 2017 and thereafter the father paid $1,000 per fortnight and the mother $370 per fortnight) which was used to meet the expenses of the children [f. 133]. in 2021, the mother unilaterally changed this arrangement by withdrawing half of the proceeds of the joint account and closing it. she thereafter sought a child support assessment. the father was assessed to pay the mother $979 per month. the father met his obligations pursuant to that assessment. since the mother’s relocation to brisbane (at which time the children entered into the father’s full-time care) the mother was not assessed as being required to pay child support to the father. she makes no payment to the father for their care and all the children’s day-to-day living expenses are met solely by the father save for school fees which are met equally by the parties. the financial burden imposed on the father for the care of the children has been increased as a result of the mother refusing to provide the father with a certificate of currency with respect to the children’s health insurance. in circumstances where the father is meeting the children’s expenses with little to no contribution from the mother, it is submitted that it is appropriate that the mother be responsible for meeting the cost of the children’s travel to spend time with her. the likely effect of any change in the child’s circumstances (s 60cc(3)(d)) the mother’s proposal will constitute a significant change of circumstance for the children. not only will it involve a separation from the father but also their peers, school, locale and supports. it is submitted that the evidence indicates that such a change is not in their best interests. the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis (s 60cc(3)(e)) there is a significant practical difficulty and cost associated with facilitating the children’s time between [city d] and brisbane. it is for the court to determine how those costs are to be proportioned between the parties and each party has filed a financial statement in aid of that determination. as submitted above, in circumstances where the financial burden for the care of the children falls almost exclusively to the father, it is reasonable that the mother meet the cost of the children’s transport to spend time with her. the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and educational needs (s 60cc(3)(f)) it is submitted that the court would find that the father was candid and insightful in his evidence as to the difficulties that the children faced in the wake of their mother’s relocation and as a result of exposure to parental conflict. in comparison, it is submitted that the court would find that the mother lacked insight into the children’s difficulties and her contribution to such difficulties. in particular, the mother expressed the view that [y]’s “downward trajectory” (to adopt the terminology engaged in the cross-examination of the father) would be addressed by a move to the mother’s care in brisbane and when asked repeatedly by his honour as to her plans if the proposed relocation does not go well, the mother’s evidence was that she could not see it not going well and that she believed that the move to brisbane will substantially improve all aspects of the children’s lives. such view is both naïve and indicative of the mother’s lack of insight into the psychological and emotional needs of the children and evidence of the mother’s propensity to lay blame for the difficulties faced by the children at the feet of the father. the fact that the mother cannot foresee any difficulty for the children arising from a separation from their father demonstrates that the mother has no real appreciation for the value which the father brings to the children’s lives. in assessing the evidence of each of the parties, it is submitted that the court would find that the father is the parent who is best placed to meet the children’s emotional and psychological needs going forward. the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child's parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant (s 60cc(3)(g)) [x] has disclosed to her parents both that she is either gay or bisexual. despite the mother’s claim otherwise, neither parent takes issue with [x]’s sexual identity and are supportive of her. aboriginal and torres strait islander children (s 60cc(3)(h) not applicable. the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents (s 60cc(3)(i)) it is submitted that the court would be concerned as to the mother’s attitude towards the children and the responsibilities of parenthood arising from: (i) the mother’s hasty relocation to brisbane which it is submitted the court would find was both insensitive and manipulative towards each of the children, (ii) the mother’s decision to remain living in brisbane rather than return to [city d] in order to ease some of the difficulties experienced by the children, (iii) the mother’s subsequent exploitation of the children’s adjustment issues, which has included encouraging [x] to run away from the father’s care, and (iv) the exposure of [x] in particular to the mother’s negative view of the father, engineered to undermine [x]’s relationship with him. any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family (s 60cc(3)(j)) and family violence orders (s 60cc(3)(k) the mother’s allegations of family violence have been addressed above. it is otherwise noted that no family violence orders have issued with respect to, or for the protection of, a party or subject child in this matter. whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child (s 60cc(3)(l)) as identified by [ms s] in the cir, the primary need for the children is for the conflict to end. it therefore follows that it is clearly in the best interest of the children for the litigation to end and for orders to be crafted which reduce the possibility of further proceedings. it is submitted that the orders which are least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings are those proposed by the father. in particular, the orders sought by the father with respect to parental responsibility and [y]’s schooling will aid in the reduction of further conflict. the father has otherwise demonstrated since [early] 2022 that if the children live in his full time care, he will obey court orders and ensure the children have the benefit of an ongoing meaningful relationship with the mother. there could be no confidence that the mother would do similarly if the children were to move to live with her, raising the spectre of future proceedings in the form of recovery orders and contravention proceedings. any other fact of circumstance that the court thinks is relevant (s 60cc(3)(m)) all relevant matters have been addressed above.   the court would reject the mother’s evidence that at the end of 2021, the owners of the property she was renting informed her that they were unexpectantly returning from [overseas] [m. 91(a)]. in fact, the mother has informed [ms s] that she was returning to live at the [suburb dd] property owned by her in early 2022. further, the family whose home the mother was renting was always due to return at that time. (ii) despite the mother’s claims that she was informed in late 2021 that [her employer] was unable to renew her contract as a [professional] due to financial constraints [m. 91(b)], subpoenaed records confirmed that the mother continues to be employed by that [employer] and she conceded (albeit somewhat reluctantly) that this was her main source of income. in her evidence in chief, the mother confirmed that she had received an oral offer of permanent full-time employment at [r organisation]. (iii) whilst the mother claims that the move was to reduce conflict with the father, it has been to the contrary. although stating to the father [in late] 2021 that she would sign any document he had his solicitor prepare [f.40] the mother subsequently declined to do so.  ) despite the mother’s claims that she was informed in late 2021 that [her employer] was unable to renew her contract as a [professional] due to financial constraints [m. 91(b)], subpoenaed records confirmed that the mother continues to be employed by that [employer] and she conceded (albeit somewhat reluctantly) that this was her main source of income. in her evidence in chief, the mother confirmed that she had received an oral offer of permanent full-time employment at [r organisation].

written submissions on behalf of the respondent  born [in] 2010 aged 13, and [y] born [in] 2013 aged 10 years.
orders conceded to by the mother the mother concedes that orders be made in accordance with the orders sought by the father during the currency of this hearing namely, the minute of orders sought annexed to the father’s case outline. such a concession represents the mother attempting to resolve the dispute on the basis of the orders sought by the father in that minute. that minute was confirmed as the orders sought by the father at t.23.08.23 page 7 line 30 and not amended during the currency of this hearing or indeed until the father’s submissions. there was no mention of the proposed amendment during any of the appearances since the first two days of hearing. the effect of those orders sought is that the children would continue to live with the father, the parents would have equal shared parental responsibility and the children would spend time with their mother in accordance with the orders proposed in the father’s minute of orders sought annexed to his case outline. accordingly, the mother makes a large concession that orders be made for the children to live with the father in [city d]. father’s implicit application to amend the orders he seeks the father in written submissions filed on his behalf on 16 november 2021 does not seek leave to amend the orders sought to seek orders in accordance with amended orders sought annexed to those submissions, but rather assumes he has leave to do so. there is no underlying or strikethrough to indicate what the amendments are. leave is required by virtue of part 2.8 and in particular rules 2.50 to 2.52. as to relevant principles see the high court in aon risk services australia ltd v australian national university [2009] hca 27, (2009) 239 clr 175. leave is opposed. the evidence is closed. there is a degree of unfairness including procedural unfairness in such a late and previously unforecast amendment. court not limited to the orders sought by the parties it is accepted that the court is not limited in parenting proceedings to the orders sought by each of the parties subject to natural justice considerations. (see the high court in u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) flc 93-112). in the event that the court is minded to grant leave to the father to amend the orders sought by him, or the court of its own motion considers the making of such orders (notice of which effectively given at t 23.8.23 page 71 line 34 to page 72 line 7), then the following submissions are made as to the remaining areas in dispute. remaining dispute narrow the remaining areas of dispute are of very narrow compass. the mother seeks equal shared parental responsibility. the father, in the minute attached to his submissions, seeks a hybrid order in relation to medical matters. the father seeks an order concerning [y]’s attendance at a private school. limited factual findings necessary given the very much reduced scope of orders in dispute, it is unnecessary to traverse the vast majority of the submissions made on behalf of the father. it is unnecessary and undesirable to make findings other than those that are necessary to resolve the remaining dispute. not responding to matters not relevant to parental responsibility, should not be taken to be an admission or acceptance of the facts asserted in the father’s submissions. to the contrary, there is significant dispute about much of the content of those submissions. many of the findings urged, for example, “manipulative” are not only unnecessary, but are likely to be counter-productive and unhelpful given the already difficult state of the parties’ relationship and conflict between them. parental responsibility – medical matters the primary area of dispute is parental responsibility in relation to medical matters with the father amending the position that he took until the filing of his submissions that there be equal shared parental responsibility in the event the children live with him. the maintenance of that position until that time may be viewed as a concession by the father as to the appropriateness of such an order subject to the cross examination of him by your honour referred to at paragraph 12 above, and the cross examination of the father by the icl at t 23.8.23 page 73 line 1. the mother was seeking orders that she have sole parental responsibility if the children were to move to live with her in brisbane and that there be equal shared parental responsibility if the children remain living with the father in [city d]. the mother was cross examined as to what counsel for the father put and the mother accepted as “a contradiction” as follows:
at t 24.08.23 page 132, line 35 on: “q, firstly, you seek parental responsibility if the children live in brisbane?... a: yes. q: but if the children remain in [city d], you seek equal shared parental responsibility? ... a: yes. q: do you see that there might be a contradiction in those two proposals? ... a: yes. q: and how do you justify that contradiction? ... q: because if they are permitted to move there’s a whole range of decisions that need to be made about their treating practitioners, moving schools, all that sort of thing, and that those decisions need to happen fairly rapidly. q: and is it your position that [mr moyland] is not capable of making rapid decisions? ... a: it’s my position that we are not always good at doing that, no.” accordingly, in the circumstances the mother’s implied concession in terms of the orders sought for sole parental responsibility if the children move to brisbane, is of more limited compass. there is no doubt that the mother (indeed each of the parents) love these children very much and are very motivated and interested in contributing to their welfare. the children each have and have had significant medical issues. the mother was the primary carer for the children until separation. the parties had an equal time arrangement from separation until the mother moved to brisbane. the mother has had a long history of significant involvement in assisting the children with medical matters. the evidence, including cross examination, revealed the mother to have been very much involved in the detail of attending to the children’s significant and ongoing medical needs. indeed, the, with respect appropriate, concessions by the father on these topics revealed in the cross examination are illuminative: t 23.08.23, page 26, line 15 onwards and in the cross examination about [x]’s diagnosis of [a medical condition] which the father describes as “an associated condition that participated with her [illness]”. the father fairly conceded: “the management of a number of the appointments and conveying of information, often tests would lead those things and i would, you know, work with her to understand what i needed to do ... or attend where i could.” further cross examination revealed, “q: and medical treatment, like a lot of things, can be a continuum of different values in parenting ... mmm q: it’s the case, isn’t it, that one of the things that became a source of conflict between you and the mother was what steps needed to be taken, or were taken, or weren’t taken, in relation to [x]’s medical matters, the allergies, etc, would you agree with that, or not? ... a: only in part. q: so what do you not agree with? a: i think the only issue around [x]’s– the management of [x]’s issues were the mother’s expectations about what [an allergic] household environment was and how to implement it. i don’t recall any other specific medical management disagreements. accordingly, careful examination of the evidence reveals that whilst decisions were sometimes difficult to make, there were very few, if any, occasions where the parents were unable to make a medical decision. indeed, there are very limited examples cited in the father’s submissions. at paragraph 25 of the submissions, the issue raised about [x] was not engaged with a psychologist and reference is made to part of the cross examination of the father by the icl at t 70, lines 12 to 40 and on. however, the mother was also cross examined at page 129 and page 130. in reality, this represents a circumstance where [x] herself has some ideas about the value of attending such a process and revealed the mother attentively organised the head space app for [x]. reference is made in the father’s submissions to the parties’ positions in relation to therapy and whether it is confidential or non-reportable. it is not apparent that once form of therapy reportable or not reportable, is preferable to the other. the issue seems to have been about whether the process might be admissible in court proceedings. presumably the father thought that the contents of the same would not assist him. in any event, and more to the point, the proceedings are now concluded and that risk arguably ended with it. the father’s submissions also at [27] cite the health fund issues however this is not a particularly good example of inability to make decisions concerning health matters. indeed, the matter was canvassed in cross examination of the mother at transcript, page 146 on. more importantly, not only has the mother been significantly involved in the care of the children’s medical needs, but there may be some advantages having regard to the particular needs of the children that confirm why it is important for her to continue to be so involved. there is a close relationship between the children and their mother and there are some sensitive issues that the father conceded that the children might be more comfortable talking with their mother about. for example, t 23.08.23, page 42, line 38: “q: now with [x], during that period of time there have been some sensitive issues in her life, do you agree with that? a: yes. q: so she had her first period in around [late] 2021, is that right or not? a: i’m unsure. q: and do you see that as being potentially something that she was more comfortable talking to her mum about? a: absolutely. q: than you? a: yes.” and same transcript at page 43, line 1 onwards: “q: her sexuality ... a very sensitive topic? a: yes ... q: and, do you think that she might have felt more comfortable talking to her mother about that or not? a: potentially.” whilst some decisions, including during litigation, have been difficult, the mother has important contributions to make an indeed may be better placed in connection with some decisions. it is submitted that no weight should be given to the [dr b] reports. the father whilst seeking weight be attached to [dr b]’s reports is silent to the comment of most relevance to the remaining issue in dispute namely, parental responsibility, the most recent expression of which is in the report 25 january 2023 answering questions at question e: in expressing this opinion had you considered the orders that [ms shearer] seeks about the parents having equal shared parental responsibility? answer: ...i also supported [ms shearer]’s position with ‘i consider that the issue of sole parental responsibility for either parent is problematic (but) the children want and need both of their parents to participate in decision making about them, no matter how hard it is for their parents to do so’... in addition to potentially excluding the mother who has been substantially involved in medical matters, there are risks of changing parental responsibility. these include a risk of the father behaving in a high-handed manner. there are suggestions in the evidence of the father failing to consult with the mother about some issues that he engaged in with the children including the adhd assessment. (see transcript at page 158, line 30). also, the engagement with the counsellor upon self-harming. there is a risk that rather than decrease conflict, such a change might lead to an increase in conflict. there is also a risk that in the event that there are issues that the children are more comfortable talking to their mother about than their father, that aspects of their medical care will not be attended to.
schooling the mother does not object to [y] attending [f school] if the father is able to pay the whole of the private school fees without contribution from the mother. the mother’s financial situation is such that she cannot afford to pay any share of the private school fees whilst she is paying all of the costs of travel for herself and the children to spend time together.
written submissions on behalf of the independent children’s lawyer
the parties’ positions the father seeks final orders in accordance with his minute of final orders annexed to his written submissions filed on 16 november 2023. the mother, as set out in her written submissions filed on 14 december 2023, indicates she will agree to the orders sought by the father annexed to his outline of case document filed 16 august 2023. the orders sought by the father in his outline of case document differ to his minute of final orders in his written submissions in relation to: parental responsibility where the father now seeks that he have sole parental responsibility for the children in relation to medical, dental and allied health issues, the father now seeks a positive order that [y] attend [f school, suburb g] for her high school education, and some changes to the children’s attendance at medical, dental and allied health appointments where the father seeks sole parental responsibility for the children on that issue. assuming each parties’ position is accepted by the court – noting the mother has raised an issue of procedural fairness in the father’s change of position on parental responsibility –the contentious issues appear to have significantly narrowed. the agreed orders the parties now appear to agree that the children should remain primarily living with the father in [city d] and spend time with the mother in [city d] and queensland. the independent children’s lawyer (‘icl’) considers that arrangement to be in the best interests of the children for the following reasons: both parties agree that the children each have a meaningful relationship with each parent and that the children derive a benefit from those relationships. each party gave evidence that the other parent interfered negatively with the children’s relationship with the other parent. the evidence suggested, in the icl’s view, that the mother has not acted in the best interests of the children on several occasions including: in relation to her decision to leave [city d] in the manner she did in early 2022, in encouraging and facilitating [x] to leave the father’s house and [city d] and the surrounding events occurring [in mid] 2022, in the information the mother provided to [y]’s therapist on 21 march 2023. the risk posed by the mother in continuing to not act in the best interests of the children and potentially interfere with the children’s relationship with the father is mitigated to a large extent by the children living primarily with the father. the mother’s meaningful relationship with the children will be maintained by the time it is proposed she spend with the children. the icl notes that the orders as to lives with agreed between the parties are inconsistent with the children’s expressed views and wishes. the icl submits there is some evidence to suggest those views and wishes should not be determinative and should be approached with some caution. the parties appear to be in agreement as to the manner and frequency of communication between the children and the other parent. those orders allow for set time communication and otherwise require the parents to facilitate communication in accordance with the wishes of the children. given the ages of the children, that appears appropriate. parental responsibility the father’s position the father came into the final hearing seeking an order for equal shared parental responsibility but with some specific orders in relation to medical issues. the father’s written submissions and minute of orders sought seek that he have sole parental responsibility for the children in relation to medical, health and allied health issues subject to a requirement that he consult with the mother. the father seeks all other aspects of parental responsibility be shared between the parties albeit he seeks a specific order with respect to [y]’s enrolment at high school. the mother complains that the father has not sought leave to change his final position and says leave would be opposed were it sought. the icl considers the father’s change of position was elicited and canvassed at trial both under cross examination by the icl and as set out below. the icl submits the mother would not be surprised by the father seeking such an order given the way the evidence fell. in any event, it is correct that the court can depart from the positions of each of the parties. the father’s position on equal shared parental responsibility appeared to change when cross-examined about [x]’s apparent (and accepted by the father) need for therapeutic psychological or psychiatric support. the father’s position was that he had not taken steps to engage [x] in therapy partly because of [x]’s expressed reluctance but also because of the possibility of conflict with the mother and the mother undermining that process. the father was asked why, in circumstances where he had apparently been unable to meet [x]’s need, he would continue to seek an order for equal shared parental responsibility. he eventually agreed that ‘having a mechanism that provides a resolution if we can’t agree would ..... be a better outcome than we have now’ the father also agreed that the information given by the mother to [y]’s newly engaged psychologist (that he had a [mental illness], that there was an apprehended violence order between him and his first wife made as a result of him [the father] trying to run her [his first wife] over with a car) was an example of the mother seeking to undermine [y]’s psychological treatment. the father accepted there may be some critical issues that the children may not be willing to discuss with him, presumably given their ages and sex. the father appropriately (in the icl’s view) conceded that and indicated a willingness to provide for any sort of assistance as may be necessary. in the icl’s view the father demonstrated insight into the possibility that the children may not feel comfortable raising certain issues with him and there is nothing to suggest the court could not have confidence he can and will manage those issues when they arise in an appropriate way. the mother’s position the mother’s position coming into final hearing was: that she have sole parental responsibility if the children live with her in queensland, or that there be an order for equal shared parental responsibility should the children remain living with the father in [city d]. the mother states in her case outline document that, assuming the children lived with the mother in brisbane and the father remained living in [city d], an order for equal shared parental responsibility ‘makes it less practicable to successfully exercise equal shared responsibility’. the father submits the mother seeking an order for sole parental responsibility should the children live with her in queensland is a concession on her part as to a ‘lack of capacity to communicate and reach agreement with the father on major issues’. the mother was cross-examined on there being a contradiction in her two proposals. her justification of the contradiction was that decisions might need to be made rapidly were the children to be permitted to relocate to live with her in queensland. on this basis, the mother submits her implied concession is ‘of a more limited compass’. the icl submits the mother’s position is more adequately explained by her view that the father has ‘failed to adequately engage with the children’s mental health needs and medical needs including allergies/intolerances and obtaining timely medical support where needed’. under cross examination, the mother gave evidence which, in the icl’s submission, suggested a significant ongoing lack of trust in the father. in addition to the example given by the father at paragraph 27 of his written submissions, the mother gave evidence of her view that the father had lied under oath in his evidence about never having received a diagnosis of [a mental illness]. in addition to the mother’s apparent ongoing lack of trust in the father, the mother gave evidence that she believes the father continues to ‘gaslight’ her including using medical intervention to do so. the following exchange sets out the mother’s example of the father’s continued gaslighting of her:
and what’s an example of him continuing to gaslight you?---that he doesn’t recall – so last – last week, we had an exchange around – an exchange around [y] being placed on some new medication. he doesn’t recall. he doesn’t remember. he won’t get a second opinion when i ask for it. we go to the doctor. the doctor says, “no, [y] is – [y] is dairy-free.” and so the whole conversations that i’ve been having about [y] being dairy-free, [mr moyland] just denies. whatever the truth is about [y]’s medication, this is an example of the parties being unable to co-operate or agree on medical or health issues concerning the children. under cross-examination, the mother first agreed that her move to queensland had not lessened the conflict between the parties. the mother later appeared to resile from that position and suggested that ‘[things] have certainly improved between me and [mr moyland]. we’re much better at ignoring each other’. noting the significant concerns raised by [dr b] about [x] possibly having an eating disorder, the mother gave evidence that she believed elements of [x]’s health would ameliorate on moving to queensland. the mother gave evidence to the effect that [x] acts in a different manner around her and that she does not [display disordered behaviours] around her. the mother’s evidence on that issue included the following exchange: i absolutely believe there’s a significant issue... ‘but it’s only when the children are with the father? –yes’ leaving aside the icl’s concerns about the apparent naïve view of [x]’s issues by the mother, the parties appear to be ‘on different pages’ as to [x]’s issues. given the parties’ history of non-cooperation and conflict on such issues, it seems likely the parties will continue to disagree as to the nature of [x]’s issues and as to what treatment she needs. if the issue is an eating disorder and [x] continues not to get the treatment she needs, that is of serious concern to the icl. in addition to concerns about [x] having an eating disorder, there appears to also be some suggestion that [x] has, or should undertake testing for, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). that issue appears to have arisen in or about mid-2022 and in relation to [x]’s engagement with [ms aa]. further concerns appear in recent reports from [x]’s school counsellor. the mother accepted that she had not done anything about that diagnosis and said: ‘we sought information from the father about how this had happened and why this had happened and...’. shortly after this, it was put to the mother that she had effectively blamed the father for problems the children have and stymied the father’s ability to obtain the proper treatment for them. whilst the mother denied that, the icl submits the evidence supports it.
the icl’s view the father indicated at trial that his position had, or was likely to, change given the cross-examination on the issues of [x] needing but not getting therapeutic assistance in relation to her eating issues and the incorrect information being given to [y]’s therapist by the mother. the above two issues are good examples of the children’s health and wellbeing being directly impacted by the parties’ inability to work co-operatively. these issues have permeated the parties parenting relationship since the mother’s relocation and there is no evidence to suggest it will ameliorate. it is likely, in the icl’s view, that the conflict and lack of cooperation between the parties has led directly to the obvious (and accepted by both parties) decline in the children’s functioning. where the parties cannot co-operate for the benefit of the children, one party should hold sole parental responsibility and, where the children will remain living with the father, that should be him. should the court require further evidence suggesting the parties cannot hold equal shared parental responsibility, the icl points to: the lack of trust between the parties, in particular the mother’s view that the father lied under oath about having a diagnosis of [a mental illness], the mother’s belief that the father continues to ‘gaslight’ her including via medical intervention, and the mother’s position that the only way in which the conflict between the parties has improved is that the parties are now ‘better at ignoring each other.’ the icl notes that the father seeks sole parental responsibility for health and medical issues only but also seeks an order in relation to the school [y] is to attend in 2024. in the icl’s view that leaves relatively few other long-term issues that would be the subject of an order for equal shared parental responsibility. that being the case, the court may consider it more appropriate that the father hold sole parental responsibility for all issues. school the father seeks a positive order for [y] to commence high school at [f school] in 2025. this is the same school that [x] presently attends. the father submits that in the absence of a positive order as to where [y] should attend school, it is likely that the parties will not be able to reach agreement on that issue. where the mother says the parties should have equal shared parental responsibility, the mother effectively seeks the parties agree on that issue. the mother, in her evidence, also confirms that ‘[mr moyland] and i cannot reach agreement as to the girls’ future education.’ the father gives some positive evidence about [x]’s experience at [f school] including that she is positively engaged with group activities and sport at school and that ‘she is an active participant in a range of activities at school, being a member of her house executive, regularly volunteering for school functions and charity work...’. in contrast, there was some evidence produced that indicated [x] has not been regularly attending school and that there was some reluctance on her part to doing so. it did not appear that was as a result of the school itself. the mother also gave evidence that she had apparently been removed from school lists and had not been receiving information from the school about [x]. again, that did not appear to be an issue with the school itself other than the school apparently only assigning online access to one parent. that, as was suggested at trial, could be remedied by an order of the court permitting each parent to obtain information from the school. where there are concerns about the parties being able to reach agreement as to the school to be attended by [y], the icl supports a positive and particular order about it being made now. that would (hopefully) avoid future litigation on the issue in the event it was left to the parties and they could not agree. the icl supports an order that [y] attend [f school] in 2025 for the following reasons: [x] presently attends [f school], [f school] is the father’s choice for [y] and it is agreed that the children will live primarily with him in [city d], and there is no evidence to suggest it should not be [f school].
written submissions on behalf of the applicant in reply
amendment of the father’s position the position of each of the mother and father has changed following the closing of evidence in this matter, although it is properly conceded that there is a qualitative difference between the two insofar as the mother’s amendment is to now concede orders sought by the father at the commencement of trial. the amendment of the mother’s position was not relayed until written submissions were filed on her behalf and only after the father’s written submissions were filed. it is conceded that, unless the court dispenses with the requirement of r.250 pursuant to r. 1.31, then both parties will require leave to amend the orders sought by them. it is submitted that the court would grant leave in the circumstances where: the trial came to an unorthodox conclusion, given the final date allocated for the trial was vacated following [dr b]’s deregistration. thus, the opportunity that usually presents itself at the conclusion of evidence for the partes to address any refinement or amendment to the orders sought by them did not present itself until the filing of submissions, the issue of parental responsibility was a live one within the hearing itself and canvassed extensively during cross-examination in circumstances where the mother herself was contending for an order for sole parental responsibility were the children to live in queensland, the mother points to no actual prejudice to her by the amendment and in particular, does not point to further evidence which would be led if the father were permitted to change his case, the mother was on notice of the formal change to the father’s position prior to final submissions being made on her behalf, and the submissions filed thoroughly and competently engage with the question of parental responsibility. further, it is submitted that issues of procedural fairness to the mother are otherwise ameliorated by the fact that: the icl has advanced her own independent position as to parental responsibility in her written submissions which foreshadows [at 40] that the court may consider it more appropriate that the father hold sole parental responsibility for all issues, which is a position that the father does not seek to be heard against, the submissions of each of the parties concur that the court is not bound by the terms of the parties’ positions subject to procedural fairness requirements ((u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 at [30], scarlett & bradshaw [2019] famcafc 184 at [22]). it is properly conceded on behalf of the mother [written submissions at [15]] that his honour gave notice that consideration of a contrary order being made to that sought by the parties that stage of proceedings was being contemplated by him. the basis for the father’s position as to parental responsibility was set out [23]-[28] of the father’s primary submissions. it is important to note that the father’s proposal will require consultation with the mother prior to making a decision in exercise of parental responsibility in relation to medical, dental and allied health care although he holds ultimate decision making in the event of disagreement. orders 27 and 28 proposed by the father clearly contemplate the mother’s ongoing involvement with respect to the children’s medical appointments. hence, the fact that the children may feel more comfortable discussing certain issues with their (which is not to say that they cannot and do not discuss such issues with their father) is not a basis upon which the court would conclude that an order for equal shared parental responsibility was in the children’s interest, particularly where it remains open to the mother to relay such information to the father or practitioner directly [mother’s submissions at [44]-[45] & [54]]. the court would otherwise reject the speculation that the father may seek to exercise any sole parental responsibility in a “high handed” manner [mother’s submissions at [50]] in circumstances where the evidence at trial does not support such a proposition. it is further observed that such a proposition is otherwise inconsistent with the father’s proposal for consultation with the mother and her continued involvement in medical, dental and allied health matters for the children. weight to be afforded to [dr b]’s report it is suggested on behalf of the mother that the father seeks weight to be placed on [dr b]’s report [written submissions at [49]] and on this basis seeks for the court to have regard to the opinions expressed by her in ex. drb2, whilst nevertheless maintaining no weight should be placed on her evidence [at [48]]. the position of the father with respect to [dr b]’s report is set out clearly at paragraphs [3]-[7] of his primary submissions. it is not contended by the father that the court would place any weight on any of the views, opinions or recommendations expressed by [dr b]. the limited utility of the report, consistent with the order made on 19 october 2023 was set out at paragraph [6] of the primary submissions. enrolment at [f school] it appears from the written submissions that each party concurs with [y]’s enrolment at [f school] for high school [at 55], the mother’s concession being conditional upon the father meeting all of [y]’s school fees on the basis that she will be solely meeting the costs of the children’s travel for the purpose of exercising time with her. the father does not concede the mother should not meet these costs when she continues to be responsible for the costs of [x] attending the same school.
outline of principle 4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. "[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms." because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be "best" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing.
on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.” on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.   the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(2))  ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s 60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues:
the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility.  ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words “meaningful involvement”. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting:
the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements.  ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]–[199]):  6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) — (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than “1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays” or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve “both” parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children.  ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system”. “meaning” is defined as “having intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)”. a second definition is “conveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive”. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines “meaning” (in generalised use) as “significance”. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as “full of meaning, significant”. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as “expressive or significant: a meaning look”. [26] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
i am conscious that a long-distance relationship, with longer but less frequent times spent together, is inevitably different from a relationship where people live closer together with regular face-to-face contact. but it does not itself mean it cannot be meaningful.
we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o’ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]:
the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a “meaningful relationship” with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court’s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child’s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider “the benefit to the child” of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j’s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original)
the full court also observed at [191]: “the first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression ‘meaningful relationship’ is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a ‘meaningful relationship’ ”.  7] for our part, we echo the view expressed by the trial judge of the serious nature of depriving the father of contact in circumstances where that appears to have been engineered by the mother, without any fault on the part of the father at all. this cannot be in a child's best interests. [178] it also does not appear to us to be appropriate for a parent to be able to manipulate the family law system to such an extent that the other parent's hope of ever seeing the child again, rests upon the possibility that she may wish to seek him out in later adolescence or adulthood. [179] we think that a family court would not be doing its duty if it were to simply give in to these sorts of considerations, except in the most extreme case and only then, when a positive determination is made that the welfare of the child requires it.
given the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the court must consider the conduct of the parents, not with a view to rewarding one or punishing the other, but to ascertain from such conduct whether the welfare of the child will be better served in the custody of one or the other.
