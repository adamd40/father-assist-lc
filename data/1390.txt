reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background  hilding] stated that she did not believe that he would do that. [ms hilding] stated she had never been physically assaulted by [mr deeks].
the parties’ current applications
the custodial parent’s freedom of movement and his or her right to choose where to live may itself be a factor in the welfare of the child. as the person responsible for the custody of the child, the custodian’s ability to function effectively is important to the child’s welfare... a child’s welfare may well be adversely affected if the custodian’s movements are restricted. it the court were to interfere unduly with the way of life which the custodial parent legitimately proposes to adopt, there may be frustration and bitterness which might adversely affect the child...
the child impact report
it is [ms hilding]’s view that [mr deeks] was the instigator of the conflict and his inability to control his anger in front of [x] makes him an unsafe person for [x] to spend time with. it is her view that her move to new south wales was a protective act, protecting [x] from exposure to [mr deeks’] angry outbursts and marijuana use. it is [mr deeks’] view that [ms hilding] was controlling and had unrealistic expectations of his role in the relationship. it is his view that [ms hilding]’s move to new south wales, with [x], has deprived [x] of a paternal relationship and is an attempt to sever the relationship between himself and [x].[5]
the parents, however, appear to have vastly different approaches to parenting and their styles of parenting are at odds with each other, leading each to view the others’ parenting style as deficient. [ms hilding] has a structured, more routine based approach to parenting whilst [mr deeks] has a more laisse faire approach to parenting. [6]
any future parenting arrangement should consider [x]’s sense of security and wellbeing with her primary attachment figure. it has been over a year since [x] has spent any face-to-face time with her father and, if safe to do so, she will need to be reintroduced to spending time with her father in a planned and considered manner. at [x]’s age, long periods of separation from a parent will likely impact the quality of the relationship with that parent. it may be considered that initially [x] will benefit from limited time with her father, perhaps with a third-party present for assurances, prior to graduating to unsupervised time, and then perhaps overnight time. a gradual progression of time will likely allow [x] to reconnect and develop a relationship with [mr deeks], and develop a sense of comfort in his presence, prior to spending significant time apart from [ms hilding]. [7]
whilst it is [ms hilding]’s view that she acted protectively in moving herself and [x] from adelaide to sydney, it does not appear that she considered the impact of severing the relationship between [x] and her father and what it would mean for [x] to spend no time with her father for over a year. it appears that [ms hilding]’s main safety concern stems from the risk she believes [mr deeks] poses towards herself. her concerns around the risk [mr deeks] poses towards [x] appear more tenuous and were difficult to define.[8]
...consideration could perhaps be given to [x] spending limited supervised time, for a period of 12 weeks, with her father. if this time is progressing positively and no risk is identified by the supervision service, it could be considered that, on an interim basis, time between [x] and [mr deeks] may progress to a full day of unsupervised time between [x] and her father for a further period of six months, progressing to overnight time, once a month. it is suggested that, on an interim basis, [x]’s time with her father alternate between sydney every second month, and adelaide in the intermediary month, and that each parent bear the responsibility for costs around travel in each alternate month.[9]
in broad terms, subject to her financial circumstances, ms hilding would fall in with such an approach.
legal considerations
the nature of an interim hearing
how the court determines a child’s best interests  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
parental responsibility
family violence
...violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.
in the current matter, each party seems to have acknowledged to ms f that x has been exposed to the conflict between them.
assessment of risk
apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
relocation
it [is] highly desirable that, except in cases of emergency, the arrangements which will be in the child’s best interests should not be determined in an abridged interim hearing, and these are the type of cases in which the child’s present stability may be extremely relevant on an interim basis. it further appears to me the comments of warnick j in c & s remain apt and relevant to determination of these cases.
in my view it is clear that the interests of any child or children, including the children here, are very much connected with any questions directly affecting those children, such as a re-location, being determined by a court without the impediment of a situation of recent development, which situation significantly alters the relationship of the child or circumstances of the child with regard to one of its parents, from what it or they had been immediately beforehand.
... it must be accepted that, regrettably, stereotypical views as to the proper role of a mother are still pervasive and render the question whether a mother would prefer to move to another state or country or to maintain a close bond with her child one that will, almost inevitably, disadvantage her forensically. a mother who opts for relocation in preference to maintaining a close bond with her child runs the risk that she will be seen as selfishly preferring her own interests to those of her child, a mother who opts to stay with her child runs the risk of not having her reasons for relocating treated with the seriousness they deserve it must be acknowledged that it is likely that, in very many relocation cases, a mother will concede that, if she has to choose between relocation and having her child live with her, she will choose to have her child live with her. that being so, she runs the risk that her interests will not be properly taken into account. to avoid that possibility, it is essential that, in relocation cases, each competing proposal be separately evaluated.”[20]
if effect is to be given to those principles, [the principles underlying pt vii of the act] it must not be assumed that one parent (the father) cannot move and the that the mother must, in every case, subordinate her ambitions and wishes, not to the needs of the child, but to the wishes of the father to pursue his life in the place of his choosing. it is the interests of the child which are paramount, not the interests or needs of his parents, let alone the interests of one of them.[21]
conclusions
... what is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents’ proposals embraced in competing applications involve again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children’s best interests.[23]  onsideration could perhaps be given to [x] spending limited supervised time, for a period of 12 weeks, with her father. if this time is progressing positively and no risk is identified by the supervision service, it could be considered that, on an interim basis, time between [x] and [mr deeks] may progress to a full day of unsupervised time between [x] and her father for a further period of six months, progressing to overnight time, once a month. it is suggested that, on an interim basis, [x]’s time with her father alternate between sydney every second month, and adelaide in the intermediary month, and that each parent bear the responsibility for costs around travel in each alternate month.[24]
