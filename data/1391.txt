and the court notes that
reasons for judgment
judge taglieri:
documents relied upon by the parties
the mother’s evidence and witnesses
the mother’s evidence in respect of the parenting proceedings  the mother maintained that she believed considerable alcohol continued to be used by the father. (b) the mother stated that there had been intermittent zoom communications between the father and the children and that during a zoom call in july 2023, the father sounded like he had been drinking alcohol. after the call ended the odd and concerning messages referred to in her affidavit were received.[2] (c) the mother rejected the suggestion that she had influenced x’s views about spending time with the father, saying that x had strong views about things and was “black and white” at times. she was firm that x’s views were her own and that dr f had been of assistance to x in being able to understand and express her views. (d) she agreed that her relationship with the father lasted almost 15 years and said she recognised there were two sides to a story, but firmly maintained that her memory of the impact of his drinking on her and the family was “vastly different” to his. (e) the mother agreed that the father had been given a range of mental health diagnoses, had engaged with general practitioners and psychologists, acknowledged a problem with alcohol and attempted to deal with the problem by engaging with a program, which showed insight on his part. (f) she confirmed that she thought the father would regularly leave the home to drink alcohol and said he had admitted this. when it was put that this was so not to expose the children to his drinking, she said “possibly” but said that he also drank in the home. (g) the mother essentially rejected the suggestion that her belief the father’s relapse into alcohol abuse in july 2023 was unfounded. she added that when she saw the bank statements showing the expenditure at bottle shops and pubs, she felt she had been “punched in the stomach”. (h) she agreed that dr l had expressed the opinion that the father had capacity to abstain from alcohol but did not accept that the alcohol testing showing negative cdt result meant that he was abstaining. (i) her beliefs and concerns about the father’s use of alcohol were based on conduct she knew from the past, the expenditure on bank statements and a view that a negative cdt test did not equate to abstinence. (j) she agreed that she would not press for supervised time if the court ordered that the father wear a detection bracelet which detected alcohol consumption through sweat. (k) the mother conceded that y had a meaningful relationship with her father but said she remained concerned that his alcohol consumption posed risk of harm. (l) she denied that y had “no reservations” about spending time with the father, saying she displayed some anxiousness which impacted her. (m) the mother agreed that she also drank alcohol during the relationship but said that she rarely did so now. (n) she stated that she remained of the view that she did not want her fears to get in the way of the children’s lives or of y seeing her father. (o) she had not thought about whether a monthly cdt test would satisfy her concerns about use of alcohol by the father, since he proposed he would see y once a month when he was on days off. (p) the mother agreed that the father had been diagnosed by dr l with an alcohol use disorder, a medical condition that is not his fault, however added that the “way he handled it in the last few years was not great”.   the mother stated that there had been intermittent zoom communications between the father and the children and that during a zoom call in july 2023, the father sounded like he had been drinking alcohol. after the call ended the odd and concerning messages referred to in her affidavit were received.[2] (c) the mother rejected the suggestion that she had influenced x’s views about spending time with the father, saying that x had strong views about things and was “black and white” at times. she was firm that x’s views were her own and that dr f had been of assistance to x in being able to understand and express her views.

(h) she agreed that, in the last two years of the relationship, she used the business credit card to pay for all expenses, including her own business and the household ones, but said when she used it in such a way, she would transfer money back from her own accounts to cover that. (i) she said the debt owing on the m finance credit card was the father’s responsibility because it has been in his name since separation, and she could not make payments towards it. she maintained that this card was “maxed out” with expenses relating to the business.   she agreed that there may be an equalling out of contributions in long relationships but disagreed that this was the case in the parties’ relationship.

ms j, court child expert  although the father denied sending abusive messages,[5] the cce agreed that some messages he had sent through the parenting app were abusive. (b) regarding alcohol addiction,[6] the father had stated when interviewed in october that he was taking a medication that made him sick if he took it while drinking alcohol. further, she had understood that he wanted to continue taking the medication. (c) she clarified her views at [44] of the specific issues report, stating that the father’s relationship with alcohol was complex and if his use negatively impacted the children then time would need to return to being supervised. when it was suggested that his time should be supervised because he was not abstinent, the cce stated he did not need to be abstinent when not seeing the children, but for his own well-being he would be best placed to be abstinent at all times due to risk of adverse effects. she gave the example that if he had a relapse because of drinking when not seeing the children, that would likely negatively impact his relationship with y. (d) the cce stated that the father should continue to seek help with his alcohol addiction and that providing head follicle testing or carbohydrate deficient transferrin (“cdt”) testing as part of the risk avoidance regime should continue.   regarding alcohol addiction,[6] the father had stated when interviewed in october that he was taking a medication that made him sick if he took it while drinking alcohol. further, she had understood that he wanted to continue taking the medication.

evaluation and findings – parenting  the mother has a loving and close relationship with both children. as their primary carer for the entirety of their life, they are bonded with her and look to her for protection, guidance and safety. (b) the father has a loving relationship with the children but has at times behaved in a way to make them (x to a greater extent) worried, frustrated and emotionally hurt because of his: (i) irritable and aggressive conduct when abusing alcohol, and (ii) inconsistency in maintaining contact. (c) the mother has fully participated in decision making about long-term issues for the children and has spent time and communicated with them fully, consistent with her role as their primary carer and their mutually meaningful relationship. (d) the father’s relationship with the children is inferred to be consistent with a hardworking father challenged by mental health and alcohol disorder. however, due to excess use of alcohol for periods, i find that he did not always participate to the fullest extent in the children’s daily routines and activities. i find that he also likely left it to the mother to make and arrange medical appointments, school and extra-curricular activities, although he had some input. (e) no major change in the children’s circumstances is proposed by either party and it is agreed that the children should continue to reside with the mother in city b. (f) as the father now resides in western australia and works on a rotating four weekly roster, i find that there is practical difficulty and expense relating to in-person time between the children and the father. however, electronic communications may be used despite the limitations relating to this, as highlighted by the evidence of both parties. (g) i accept the evidence of dr f and dr l that although the father may try to provide for the emotional needs of the children, at times he is simply incapable of doing so due to limitations in his own mental health and his alcohol abuse disorder. (h) x has developed maturity and is strong-willed and opinionated. it is important for her emotional wellbeing that her wishes and concerns about her father are acknowledged. i give her views considerable weight. (i) x has expressed the attitude that currently she does not wish contact with the father and the father accepts and respects this. (j) y is likely to be more emotionally resilient, but the parenting orders made by this court must be tailored to minimise the risk of emotional or physical harm that she may be exposed to by the father. (k) y is open to spending time with the father and has enjoyed doing so to varying extents in the past. (l) the father has not paid child support according to an administrative assessment. he explained that this is because the mother had sought an exemption on grounds of family violence. this is not disputed by the mother and her representative did not challenge the father about the evidence. i am not prepared to make an adverse finding in relation to s 60cc(3)(ca) of the act because the mother has been legally represented for most of the post-separation period and there is no evidence that she has sought to pursue child support. in the circumstances, i treat this consideration as neutral, including because i have not found the father’s family violence to have been as pervasive as claimed by the mother. (m) due to alcohol abuse disorder and other mental health conditions, the father has committed family violence in the nature of verbal abuse, derogatory taunts, verbal threats of harm and physical outbursts damaging property, including post-separation.[10] however, i do not accept this was pervasive and ever-present conduct, rather it was intermittent and occurred when the father was seriously abusing alcohol or suffering mental health compromise.

legal principles – parenting
discussion and conclusion – parenting  the mother is the children’s primary carer and has proven her capacity to make major decisions for the children, (b) it can be foreseen that that at times of mental health compromise or lapse into alcohol abuse, the father will not be able to effectively participate in joint decision making, and (c) there are practical difficulties with the father being reliably involved in making major decisions, including communication difficulties, which both admit. this makes it likely that joint decision making would be frustrated.   it can be foreseen that that at times of mental health compromise or lapse into alcohol abuse, the father will not be able to effectively participate in joint decision making, and (c) there are practical difficulties with the father being reliably involved in making major decisions, including communication difficulties, which both admit. this makes it likely that joint decision making would be frustrated.   there are practical difficulties with the father being reliably involved in making major decisions, including communication difficulties, which both admit. this makes it likely that joint decision making would be frustrated.
that [mr p] provide an undertaking to the court to act as a third-party intermediary in communication between the father and the mother. this will be in regards to all relevant matters of communication between them.   proposed order 12 of the minute is unreasonable as it would mean that the child/children never spend christmas day with the father. christmas is a special time and a significant holiday and there should be some opportunity to share this with the father and the paternal family. (b) part of proposed order 14 involves an option of using s family services as the changeover venue for y’s time with the father in city b. there will be sufficient costs incurred by the father in travelling to city b and i do not see the justification for use of an alternate service to c contact service, which poses an additional cost. instead, the changeovers can be safely and adequately managed using a person nominated by the mother at hungry jacks. (c) the mother seeks an injunction pursuant to s 68b of the act restraining the father from entering the property at which she and the children reside. noting that the father resides in western australia and that i have found the family violence by the father not to be as pervasive as claimed, i consider this injunction to be unnecessary.   part of proposed order 14 involves an option of using s family services as the changeover venue for y’s time with the father in city b. there will be sufficient costs incurred by the father in travelling to city b and i do not see the justification for use of an alternate service to c contact service, which poses an additional cost. instead, the changeovers can be safely and adequately managed using a person nominated by the mother at hungry jacks.

legal principles – property adjustment  identify the assets and the value of the assets in the property pool, (b) determine the contributions made by each of the parties to those assets, both directly and indirectly and in financial and non-financial terms, (c) determine whether any adjustment is required for s 75(2) factors, and (d) in light of those findings, determine what orders for the division of property is just and equitable.   determine the contributions made by each of the parties to those assets, both directly and indirectly and in financial and non-financial terms, (c) determine whether any adjustment is required for s 75(2) factors, and (d) in light of those findings, determine what orders for the division of property is just and equitable.   determine whether any adjustment is required for s 75(2) factors, and (d) in light of those findings, determine what orders for the division of property is just and equitable.   in light of those findings, determine what orders for the division of property is just and equitable.
as a statement of general principle. i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.

future needs and other s 75(2) considerations
we pause to note that although sometimes, in the context of the kennon argument, words such as “adverse impact”, “more arduous” or “more onerous” are used, the guideline requires the conduct of one party to have had a significant adverse effect on the contributions of the other or to have had made that party’s contributions significantly more arduous than they ought have been. the conduct has to have had a discernible impact upon the contributions of the other party (kennon at 906). the guideline has been repeatedly adopted and consistently applied over many years (see for example: s & s [2003] famca 905 (“s & s”), hill and hill [2005] famca 42, (2005) flc 93-209 at [70]–[71], stevens and stevens [2005] famca 1304, (2005) flc 93-246 at [52]–[67], baranski v baranski and anor [2012] famcafc 18, (2012) 259 flr 122 at [250]–[263], and maine v maine [2016] famcafc 270, (2016) 56 fam lr 500 at [52]).
