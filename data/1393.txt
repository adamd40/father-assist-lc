respondent’s ties to australia
... the children and i enjoy a very stable life here in australia and australia is now our home. i am self-employed and have been running a successful business in [suburb m], victoria since [mid]-2022. i am a sole director of the company, [n pty ltd]. i am also one of the directors of [o pty ltd] and [ms d] was the other director. i have more than [7] full time employees working in the business and more than [20 people] across melbourne who are our clients. i have leased a premises at [suburb m] for 3 years from [mid]-2022. further, i have stock, furniture and machinery worth more than $500,000. further, my assets include [motor vehicles] registered under my name. i have also recently purchased a land in [suburb p] for investment purposes. the settlement of the land is [in early] 2024. soon after the settlement, i plan to build [a] house on [suburb p] land for which the building contract has been signed and loan has been approved by nab. in addition to that we also have our current home at [suburb l], vic.
applicant’s concerns regarding maternal grandfather
... 14. if [x] is taken to [country b], i will not be able to ensure his return to australia. if the child does not return, it would be difficult for him to have a meaningful relationship with me. i have been estranged from my child for 3 years not because my late wife took him to [country b] to remarry and visit her parents without my consent. ... 25. i last caught a glimpse of [x] at [a park] when i took my family there in [early] 2023. i saw [ms d], [mr hegadi], [f] and who i now realise must have been [x]’s step-sister. 26. to my utter heartbreak, [x] didn’t recognize me. i didn’t want to make a scene and i was so far removed from their lives that i wasn’t even sure about whether they were visiting australia or living here. [ms d] would travel back and forth twice or thrice a year even during our marriage.
