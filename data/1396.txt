the husband’s position
relevant legal principles
in relation to the first stage, in our view, when considering whether to exercise the power under s 79 and 80(1)(h) of the act to make an interim property order the “overarching consideration” is the interests of justice. it is not necessary to establish compelling circumstances. all that is required is that in the circumstances it is appropriate to exercise the power. in exercising the wide and unfettered discretion conferred by the power to make such an order, regard should be had to the fact that the usual order pursuant to s 79 is a once and for all order made after a final hearing.[25]
in relation to the second matter, as the jurisdiction under s 79 of the act is being exercised the provision of that section must be considered and applied but with limitations given that it is not the final hearing. there is also no requirement of compelling circumstances in relation to the substantive step.[26]
it seems likely to the court that...the applicant...will be likely to receive by way of property settlement a sum sufficient to cover the advance, that would seem to be sufficient to enable the order sought to be made.[28]   together, s 79 and s 80(1)(h) of the family law act confer a power on the court to make orders for interim property settlement. (ii) section 79 confers a discrete power to make orders for property settlement and the court may exercise the power conferred by s 79 through ‘a succession of orders until the power ... is exhausted’ or a final order dealing with all the known property of the parties is made. (iii) section 80 is not in itself a source of jurisdiction for such an order to be made. rather, the section is an ‘enabling provision’ that provides various ways in which the general power in s 79 may be exercised in individual cases. this includes, by s 80(1)(h) making ‘a permanent order, an order pending the disposal of proceedings, or an order for a fixed term, or for a life or during joint lives, or until further order.’ (iv) there are two stages to the hearing of an application for property orders. (v) there is no barrier or threshold requiring an applicant to establish ‘compelling circumstances’ at either the first or second stages of the court’s consideration. (vi) given that the parties are effectively seeking access to their own funds, it is unnecessary for there to be ‘any detailed enquiry as to the purpose for which funds are to be used’. (vii) sufficient particulars must nonetheless be provided to enable the court to determine, (i) that the application is ‘genuine’. (ii) to identify ‘the circumstances that make it appropriate to give consideration to exercising its power’. (iii) to sufficiently weigh the identified need ‘against the benefit of having only one exercise of a s 79a power’. (viii) while the usual s 79 considerations apply to the second stage of the process, a detailed analysis of those considerations is not required in any interim hearing. (ix) nevertheless, because the very nature of an interim hearing is such that the court is not in a position to properly evaluation the evidence, the court should take a conservative approach including in respect of determining whether there are likely to be sufficient resources of the parties available at final hearing to accommodate any ‘adjustment issue’. (x) after completion of the first two stages, it is then necessary to focus on that ‘adjustment issue’. in terms of quantum, it is necessary to consider whether an interim property order would give a party so much that it could not be adjusted on the final hearing. (xi) in terms of form, such an order must be of a nature that it is ‘capable of alteration at any time prior to, or as part of, the final exercise of the s 79 power. (xii) in that respect, the interim order ‘must be capable of variation or reversal without resort to s 79a of the act or appeal’. (xiii) an applicant is required to show more ‘than the mere fact that upon final hearing the applicant would receive the property being sought’ or an amount in excess of the funds being sort’ from the other party. (xiv) the exercise of the jurisdiction should be conducted in the context of and with an appreciation that ‘as a generality, the interests of the parties and the court are better served by there being one final hearing of s 79 proceedings. (xv) the overriding consideration at all stages of the process is that the court is satisfied that it is ‘just and equitable’ to make the order in circumstances before the court. (xvi) in evaluating the competing contentions, it is necessary to have some regard to the fact that, in family law proceedings, one party may have the predominance of resources. (xvii) perhaps the most common situation in which the court would be prepared to entertain an application for interim property orders, is when the party with access to the least resources requires funds to conduct their own litigation, that is, to effectively even out the legal playing field. (xviii) while the majority of cases in which interim property orders have been made relate to applications to obtain funds to conduct litigation, that is by no means the only instance where such orders have been made. other instances include, (i) situations where parties may need access to resources ‘to meet debts which may result in the party being pursued by creditors’. (ii) the need for a party to make payments to the benefit of the children. (iii) to take advantage of other financial opportunities. (iv) where the parties consent. (v) where there are urgent situations such as: (i) where it is necessary to exercise this power if injustice is to be avoided. examples include cases where it is necessary to do so to avoid an asset being eroded or lost in the intervening period. (ii) cases (beyond the maintenance power) where an order in favour of one party is necessary to preserve or obtain a home for or is otherwise necessary for the welfare of the children.  ) section 79 confers a discrete power to make orders for property settlement and the court may exercise the power conferred by s 79 through ‘a succession of orders until the power ... is exhausted’ or a final order dealing with all the known property of the parties is made.
