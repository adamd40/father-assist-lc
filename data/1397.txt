[x] was willing to accompany her maternal aunt during the paternal individual interview time. an observation did not take place between the mother and [x] on the day of the interviews. [ms lennan] was offered this opportunity however declined. [ms lennan] was observed to be tearful and distressed following the completion of her individual interview and stated that she did not want to expose [x] to this situation. it is noted that the parties did not come into direct contact with each other on the day of the interview, this being their stated preference and accommodated by the report writer. evaluation [x] is a young pre-school child of five years. [x] is accustomed to primary paternal care over the past nearly three years, this parental relationship providing her with stability and emotional security. [x] impressed as a well-cared for child. [x] experienced parental separation as a young one year old baby. [x] has been accustomed to spending planned time with her mother, formal arrangements made in march 2022 reflecting a block period of time each week consisting of two overnights. this arrangement changed in [early] 2023 following a child protection investigation. formalised supervised maternal arrangements were taking place at [b contact service] until september 2023. [x] has not had contact with her mother either in person or by facetime calls since this time. [ms lennan] stated that it is her firm opinion that [x] needs to live in primary maternal care, not believing that this child is cared for appropriately by the father. [ms lennan] expressed significant mistrust of the father, expressing her view that he had substantially misled the court in previous legal proceedings, that she felt under pressure to agree to the consent orders dated march 2022 and that it was her long term view that [x] would benefit from primary maternal care, further expressing that [x] would also prefer this living arrangement. [ms lennan] openly expressed her personal distress during the interview process, this preventing her from participating in an observation with [x] on the day. [ms lennan] stated clearly that she would not comply with formal parenting orders if she felt that this was not in the best interests of [x]. [ms lennan] stated that distress expressed by [x], particularly at time of changeovers reflected this child’s fear of returning to the care of the father. [ms lennan] questioned the actions of child protection and the outcome of the investigation into raised allegations of sexual abuse by the father. [mr gillivray] indicated his long term concerns in respect to maternal responses this including compromised mental health and a refusal to comply with formal parenting arrangements. [mr gillivray] stated that he was fully committed to parenting his young daughter, not accepting of maternal criticisms. he expressed his distress in respect to the serous allegations of acting in a sexually inappropriate manner with [x] as reported by the mother. [mr gillivray] stated that he wanted [x] to feel safe whilst in maternal care. he acknowledged that transitions had been challenging for this child, this directly affected by exposure to adult conflict, tensions, lack of trust and heightened parental emotions. [mr gillivray] indicated a preference for a cautious approach to future maternal arrangements and changeover arrangements in order to provide [x] with the opportunity to spend time with the mother and for tension to be reduced for this child at changeovers. the parties acknowledged long term challenges in the area of parental communication and decision making. counter allegations were raised of the other parent making unilateral decisions without negotiation and agreement being reached. parental communication appears to have deteriorated particularly since final orders were made in march 2023. the father clearly indicated that it was his preference for the parties to fully comply with the formalised parenting arrangements, this providing certainty and the possibility of reducing differences of parental opinion. the mother indicated that she was not accepting that the final orders were in the best interests of [x] and that she could or would not comply if she felt strongly that this child’s needs required an alternate response. it is clear that both parties have a heightened sensitivity and caution in respect to communication and decision making concerning [x], this reflecting the extended legal proceedings in this matter and highly divergent views about what is in the best interests of this child. parental tensions, frustrations and unhappiness appear to be heightened at time of changeovers this resulting in conflict that [x] has been directly exposed to. both parties indicated a reluctance to have direct contact or communication preferring information exchange via a dedicated parenting app. and changeovers that do not require them to be in the same location. both parties expressed their distress in response to the on-going legal proceedings. [x] impresses as a well-cared for child with her needs appearing adequately provided for in the paternal home. she was described as bright, emotionally responsive, active and doing well in all aspects of her development. [x] will commence primary school in 2024. there are parental differences of opinion in relation to choice of school for [x]. it is considered highly likely that [x] has been emotionally impacted by the nature of the parental conflict. she will most likely also have some awareness of parental upset and frustration that is openly expressed on occasion in her presence. transitions at changeover have been described by both parties as difficult for [x], this child described by the mother as upset and reluctant to leave maternal care with the father describing prolonged and emotive maternal responses as not helpful for this child. it further appears that [x] has experienced invasive medical intervention following maternal concerns that this child had urinary tract infections and had made disclosures in relation to inappropriate sexualised touching by the father of her genital area. this experience would have likely caused [x] confusion and distress. it is acknowledged that there was child protection intervention in this matter in [early] 2023. the protective outcome involved continuing primary care of [x] with concerns raised in relation to maternal responses. (child and youth protective services, [city k]). reports provided indicated numerous notifications made to protective services [city k] in relation to [x] over the years. clear assessment was made in relation to [x] remaining in primary paternal care with no substantive concerns identified for the safety of [x] in the paternal home. concerns were identified in relation to the mother having a history of making false allegations in relation to the father, this including sexual abuse, maternal mental health vulnerabilities and a history of illicit drug use. the emotional needs of [x] require careful consideration and priority in this matter. the maternal proposition to substantially change the living arrangements of [x] requires caution. there appears to be a maternal belief that [x] is not safe or cared for appropriately by the father, this not supported by the recent child protection intervention and recommendations. this position gives cause for concern and indicates a lack of full insight into the needs of [x]. it is likely that a change of primary care would cause this child some confusion and instability. caution is also required in relation to descriptions made by the mother that [x] has expressed a desire to live with her. [x] is a young child who has just turned five years with her views likely to reflect acceptance of spending time with each parent, this being important to her and awareness of parental upset this causing her mixed emotions at time of transition at changeover. the strong possibility of maternal influence upon comments expressed by [x] or in her behavioural responses cannot be dismissed. maternal love for [x] is acknowledged with a preference to spend meaningful time with this child. however, there are indications of maternal vulnerabilities that require consideration and the resultant impact upon her parenting responses. it is considered unfortunate that the mother has withdrawn from attending [b contact service] and maintaining facetime contact with [x] at this time. this is likely to be a confusing situation for [x]. maternal decisions in this area appear to largely based on the high level of personal distress being experienced by [ms lennan] at this time and lack understanding of the impact upon [x] not being able to see or talk with her mother. the paternal response in relation to future maternal arrangements are considered to be highly cautious with a long transition to unsupervised and block periods of maternal time. on balance, it is considered that [x] will benefit from continuation of stable and nurturing primary care and an absence of direct exposure to adult issues of distress and conflict. [x] will also benefit from consistent and predicable maternal arrangements that provide this child the opportunity of maintaining a meaningful parenting relationship with her mother. the parties are encouraged to limit direct communication, utilising a parenting app. in order to exchange and share important information about [x], this reducing the potential for openly expressed conflict. given the challenges in the area of parental decision making, it is indicated that the primary carer of [x] continue to have sole parental responsibility with an expectation that [mr gillivray] provides information to the mother in a timely manner. the success of future changeovers indicate that it may be helpful for this child not to experience direct conflict or heightened parental emotions, with future locations including at [b contact service] or at school. at this time [ms lennan] is encouraged to re-engage with [b contact service], this service providing support and assistance of the parties and [x] to ensure a positive experience for [x]. dependent upon an absence of issues during maternal contact at [b contact service], consideration can then be given to transition to unsupervised day time arrangements and the re-introduction of block periods of maternal time. it may assist the court to receive either a copy of the mother’s described psychiatric assessment completed in [early] 2023 or for the mother to provide an alternate report in respect to her mental health from a treating specialist. it is considered of benefit to [x] if there are clear parenting arrangements in place that are not subject to frequent or sudden change, this assisting this child to experience stability in her life. the importance of both parties fully complying with formal court orders made is also considered to have a positive impact upon [x]. the continuation of acrimonious parental communication and in particular the strongly held maternal critical views are considered to be emotionally damaging for [x] and are not in her long term interests. recommendations based on the information gathered in this assessment, the following is respectfully recommended: that [x] remain in primary paternal care. that consideration be given to the father continuing to assume sole parental responsibility for [x] with an expectation that important information about this child’s health, education, welfare and activities be provided to the mother in a timely manner. that consideration be given to [x] continuing at this time to spending planned time with her mother at [b contact service] with arrangements and changeovers managed by centre staff. consideration can then be given to a transition to unsupervised day time arrangements and future block periods of maternal time. further consideration to be given to [x] having the opportunity to facetime with her mother on a weekly basis on set and predictable time. that [x] not be exposed to adult family conflict or negative views held of maternal/paternal family members. that the parties communicate utilising a dedicated parenting app. in respect to [x] only. that a report be provided to the court by [b contact service] . that the parties attend parenting programs as offered or recommended by [b contact service] in order to enhance parental communication, decision making and understanding of [x]’s individual needs. that [x] have the opportunity to engage in child focused counselling. that the mother engage in personal mental health counselling in order to assist her at this challenging time. that the mother provide a report in relation to her current mental health from a treating professional. that the mother not be affected by illicit drugs during any time spent with [x] or communicating with her.
oral evidence of ms v
written submissions on behalf of the applicant
the proceedings: these are the parties’ competing applications for parenting orders in respect of their daughter, [x]. born [in] 2018. the mother incorporates into these submissions her outline of case document, filed 3 november 2023. the applications: the mother’s proposal is first contained in her initiating application, filed 19 june 2022, but more recently in the outline of case document filed on 3 november 2023. inter alia, the mother seeks orders that [x] live with her and that she has sole parental responsibility. she proposes [x] spend regular and meaningful time with her father. the mother at the conclusion of her oral evidence adopted the proposal in respect of the drug testing “floated” by the court. the father’s amended response filed 2 november 2023 seeks, inter alia, that [x] live with him and that he have sole parental responsibility. he proposes identification time only for [x] with her mother, specifically four times a year supervised for 2 hours on each occasion. background the parties were in a relationship for about 4 years and have one child, [x], the subject of these proceedings. after commencement of proceedings in 2021, final orders were made by consent on 15 march 2022, where [x] lives with the father and spends substantial and significant time with the mother. the issues the father’s case (in at least part supported by the family consultant) is that the mother’s parenting capacity is deficient due to a combination of factors: the mother’s use of [illicit drugs]. the mother’s retention of [x] after spending time with her mother’s concern that [x] has been sexually abused in the father’s household the mother’s emotional health mother’s drug use the mother quite candidly conceded that she has in the past used illicit drugs. she asserts that she longer uses those drugs. there is no cogent or compelling evidence that contradicts the mother’s assertion. indeed, the mother was not challenged in cross examination about her evidence in relation to her drug use or in this case her abstinence from illicit drugs. the father makes wildly speculative assertions that the mother does so in his affidavit material without any evidence that she is doing so and contrary to the independent expert evidence (see drug analysis results). it was not put to the mother in her cross examination that she continued to use illicit drugs. the mother asks the court therefore to draw the inference that there is no cogent evidence that she is using such drugs. there was no expert evidence called by the father as to the likelihood of her relapsing into drug use – what was put before the court was purely speculation and had the evidence act applied to the contents of his affidavit would likely have been struck out this issue can be easily resolved by making the mother undergo hair follicle tests and by imposing a restraint on the mother using illicit drugs whilst [x] is in her care and for 24 hours prior to such time. it is not substantially different to the protections put in for a parent who is a recovering alcoholic. [x] needs to be protected in the event that the mother has a relapse but this should not be used as a device to deny [x] a meaningful relationship with her mother. the mother accepted the foregoing restriction in her exchanges with the bench and undertook that she would continue appropriate drug counselling. the mother’s supporting witnesses evidence was either not challenged or remained intact after cross examination. mother’s retention of [x] the mother again quite properly conceded she has in the past retained [x] at the conclusion of [x]’s time with her. her explanations for this are set out in her trial affidavit and are for the most part benign. they are a combination of the mother’s concerns for [x]’s health and welfare and [x]’s desire to spend more time with her mother. the father imputes more sinister motivations to the mother without identifying any foundation for those imputations. this deficiency in the mother’s respect for court orders has been addressed appropriately in the past and the same mechanism could be employed in the future should she breach parenting orders. the mother says she will comply with the court’s orders in the future. the almost total removal of the mother from [x]’s life is not required as punishment for the mother’s past failings and it is submitted not in [x]’s best interests (see family report dated 4 october 2023) allegations of sexual abuse of [x] by the mother the mother has raised concerns about possible abuse of [x] in the father’s household based on conversations she has had with [x] and physical evidence obtained by medical practitioners. the mother did not suggest that the father was the only person who may have interfered with [x]. the father denies the allegations. he is inferentially supported by the child protection authorities. the worst that can be said of the mother’s behaviour is that she has been hypervigilant. it was not suggested to the mother in cross examination that she had fabricated her evidence in this respect. a s a result it cannot simply be inferred that she did so. the father’s reaction to the medical practitioners involved in [x]’s care, it is submitted, was extreme and intimidatory (mothers affidavit paragraphs 93. again she was not challenged on this aspect of her evidence). the medical practitioners who complied with their statutory obligations reporting the matter to child protection authorities were threatened by the father. the court would be entitled to infer they are an example of the father’s coercive control as described by the mother in her evidence. his reaction to those who hold views contrary to his are subject to confrontational behaviour. the father’s amended response is a similar example of his confrontational heavy handed behaviour and one which could not be said to be in [x]’s best interests. in any event, [x] should not be deprived of a relationship with her mother when there are less drastic ways of protecting her from unsubstantiated allegations of sexual abuse. a simple restraint would afford [x] the requisite protection. an almost total prohibition of [x] being able to have a meaningful relationship with her mother is extreme, unwarranted and detrimental to [x]’s best interests. it does the father no credit and is unsupported by the evidence including that of the family consultant – nor a proposal that is supported by the icl. the father, it is submitted, lacks the insight to appreciate the impact of his behaviour on others and the orders he seeks in respect of [x] mother’s emotional health there is no expert evidence that the mother has any emotional health issues. the mother was not challenged as to her evidence in this regard and the father called no expert evidence to support his speculations. the mother provides evidence from paragraph 157 to 167 in relation to her state of mental health. they were unchallenged by the father and no relevant cross examination of her or them was undertaken on behalf of the father. the father’s speculation as to her mental health issues are not substantiated by those experts. again it is submitted that if the evidence act had been applied to the fathers affidavit in this respect it is likely his speculations would have been struck out . the mother is not undergoing any treatment for mental health issues and says she is not required to do so. the mother was not challenged in relation to that evidence. in any event the father’s case does not identify any nexus between the unsubstantiated allegations which he makes as to her health and her capacity to care for [x]. that is a significant lacunae in the fathers case. section 60cc factors the father makes no serious complaint as to the mother’s day to day care of [x]. indeed, he left [x] in the mother’s care post separation. his case with respect appears to be one of being “in competition with the mother”. he simply prefers his care for [x] to the mother’s care of [x] . he in fact concedes that she is a “good enough” parent by his joining in a cared share arrangement post separation. the fvos have been made in favour of the mother and [x] for their protection from the father’s violent behaviour. the mother contends that the father’s violent behaviour extend over the duration of their relationship and post separation and constitute. family violence and coercive control. the father had, but withdrew an fvo for his protection from the mother. significantly, it was the father who was charged and convicted of a family violence event when he damaged the mother’s property as a result of an incident at [a shopping centre] car park [in] 2022, which was only [shortly] after the previous final orders being made. as in other respects of the father’s case – the mother was not challenged about her day to day care of [x]. it is abundantly clear from the mother’s evidence, the family report and the contact reports from [b contact service] that [x] and the mother have a loving and warm relationship – entirely appropriate in all respects and that [x] is the person seeking to extend her time with her mother. put simply she misses her mother. the fact that the father thinks it is appropriate to limit her time even further is quite extraordinary in the face of that uncontroversial evidence. it is submitted that that alone shows a significant deficiency in the father’s capacity to parent, his attitude to parenting and his commitment to promoting a relationship between [x] and her mother. it is submitted that the father for his part, speculates on the mother’s motivations and [x]’s mental wellbeing without any expert evidence. indeed, his affidavit is permeated with such speculation and opinion. the father has not called expert, or any evidence and the court is therefore entitled to infer that he does not possess such evidence or that if it exists it does not support the case he is putting forward. it is contended that the father has rarely consulted the mother as to [x]’s care and has simply acted unilaterally with little consultation with the mother and little information provided to her (see schooling). that is unlikely to be alleviated by the orders he seeks. it is arguably going to exacerbate that deficiency in his care of [x] and impose an impediment to [x] having a meaningful relationship with her mother. it is clear that the father does not hold the mother in high regard and is in fact openly hostile towards her and contemptuous of her relationship with [x]. his view, it seems, is shared by his sister who plays a significant role in [x]’s day to day care. the court has ample evidence from the father from which it could be inferred that he is unlikely to pro-actively promote a relationship between [x] and her mother. the father’s amended response being a prime example of his true motivation, namely to remove the mother from [x]’s life. his proposal is minimalist and quite cruel to [x]. it is submitted that his proposal might be characterised as vengeful. conclusion it is submitted that [x]’s best interests would support her living with her mother and spending meaningful time with both her parents. the father’s proposal would likely result in [x] not having a meaningful relationship with her mother in the foreseeable future . ( s.60cc (2) a). there was no criticism made of the mother as to her day to day care of [x] . the mothers care of [x] will substantially be undertaken by her contrasted -with the convoluted arrangement the father has in place – which cannot be comfortable for [x] if the mother is permitted to address the s.60 cc fla 1975 factors globally rather than individually it is submitted there is it is nothing adverse to her case for [x] to live with her other than the 4 matters identified above, all of which have been addressed at length (s.60cc (2) b). indeed, the final orders made in march 2023 contemplated week about arrangement (order 6). [x] has, according to the [b contact service] records, a loving and warm relationship with her mother and struggles when having to return to her father’s care. the father exhibited no insight as to that stress in the orders he proposed. in contrast the mother suspended [x]’s time with her (in consultation with a carer at [b contact service]) to relieve [x] of the stress of separation at the conclusion of visits. it is submitted that the likely effect of [x]’s change of living arrangements from the father to the mother will not be substantial. [x] has lived with the mother prior to 2021. [x] spent time with the mother consistently and frequently pursuant to the orders of march 2022 until early january 2023.
written submissions on behalf of the respondent
the evidence of the mother concerning communication & attitude the mother's evidence in the witness box was generally evasive and characterised by an inability to answer questions directly. her evidence displayed a contemptuous attitude towards court orders to the point that the court would have no confidence there would not be further breaches of orders by the mother. the mother's written submissions at [21] do the best that can be done to try to explain away repeated contraventions, suggesting the mother relied in part on the wish of a child under 3 (a significant deficiency in parenting that the mother is incapable of acknowledging). indeed, in reading [21], the obvious issue arises that if one is to use the term 'for the most part benign', one can only infer what the other part of the mother's reasons for breaching court orders was meant to be. the attitude problem of the mother continued in her evidence, in her submissions and in the case outline. the mother demonstrated no ability to acknowledge that the father had facilitated her relationship with the child in difficult circumstances, including extending facetime beyond times provided for in the court orders until put to her in the witness box. the father's evidence in this regard completely undermines the mother's intemperate assertion that the father is contemptuous of her relationship with the child. indeed, the submission and evidence in that regard sit uncomfortably, and at times hypocritically, with other parts of the evidence, including the mother's own evidence that she has received the child early and has more time with the child. the mother's submission is perhaps more concerning where, in over 14 days of withholding a child against orders, she managed a single phone call on her own evidence [63]. the lack of reflection and care taken in such an assertion concerning the father, whilst failing to address the mother's own behaviour, points to the lack of reflection, acceptance of responsibility or acknowledgment of her own deficiencies in her evidence. if yet further evidence was needed, the fact that the mother concealed in her evidence that she repeatedly would say to the child "just hang in there girl" during facetime, which was an attempt to undermine the child's relationship with the father, and to suggest that being with the father was some form of ordeal is concerning. the mother also appeared unable to understand that her manner of communication was aggressive and, at times, abusive. whilst it is plain that both parties had difficulties with their communication, the mother attempted to be highly selective in using certain communications by the father and not her own. the approach undermined her credibility. further, her criticism of the father for making unilateral decisions when he had sole parental responsibility by way of court orders sat uncomfortably with the many decisions she made for the child without consulting the father at all, particularly medical decisions. again, the lack of reflection and single-sided criticism demonstrated a concerning and troubling ongoing attitude. notably, the mother displayed no sorrow or remorse in her affidavit or in the witness box for breach of court orders or making serious allegations. she could not reflect on the impact of her behaviours on the father or the child. that lack of reflection continues in submissions made on her behalf, where it suggests the orders sought by the father are to 'punish' the mother. that is an extraordinary position where the father brought no contravention application to seek further sanction on the mother, and the father's position has some support in the expert evidence, an area of the evidence that the mother's submissions failed to address. further, the mother demonstrated no degree of significant acceptance that she would comply with court orders in the future. the mother alleged that [ms v] mis-recorded her in this regard in her family report. this was an attempt at concealing her real feelings, and [ms v] (who affirmed the accuracy of her report and the recorded attitude of breaching effectively whenever the mother felt like it) is plainly to be believed over the mother, who was deceptive to suit her case. the court is left with a situation where the mother showed little ability to reflect on her actions, accepted no responsibility and will act in breach of orders in the future on either her own concerns or the whims of a child under 5 years of age. nothing in the mother's case points away from this conclusion. such an attitude is a recipe for chaos, harm, and disruption in this young child's life. allegations of sexual abuse the mother made allegations of sexual abuse against the father. she did not simply ‘raise concerns’. it was not the first time she had made allegations concerning sexual abuse of the child. despite overwhelming investigative evidence, she did not retreat from her allegations and attitude, and her affidavit concealed the details and nature of her allegations. the mother’s allegations were entirely without foundation. the mother sought to blame doctors and medical advice for repeated examinations of the child whilst not producing a single record justifying the existence of that advice. indeed, the medical records demonstrate the mother concealed information in her affidavit, for example, that she was demanding that the child’s vulva be examined. what followed then was the mother’s unbelievable evidence concerning her engagement with the [...] rape crisis centre. the mother maintained the fiction that she did not know what to do when the court knows from the medical records (and tellingly not the mother’s affidavit) that the allegation at best was ‘dad cleaned my private part roughly’. in light of that, the mother’s suggestion that she contacted an organisation called the [...] rape crisis centre and attended the sexual assault and child abuse team of the police merely to ‘discuss her concerns’ was indicative of a manufactured deception by the mother. the mother concealed in her affidavit that the police reassured her that nothing was disclosed on [in early] 2023 and the matter would not proceed, yet the mother agreed to the director-general removing the child from the father [in early] 2023. this was demonstrative of the allegation being plainly a device used by the mother to remove the child from the father. concerningly, the mother had no ability to reflect on this accusation or its impact on the father and their future co-parenting. the mother’s submissions appear to also fail to address this. it is perhaps unsurprising that the father’s attitude towards the mother may at times have been less than generous given she made allegations against him of sexually abusing the child and even in her evidence concealed the true detail and nature of the allegation whilst simultaneously concealing from the court in contemporary documents her own drug abuse. for the mother to say in submissions that she candidly admitted drug abuse is problematic, given her refusal to do hair follicle tests at the father’s request and her failure to mention her drug abuse in all the contemporary affidavits she filed at the time of the applications for the return of the child. candid engagement with hindsight after producing a positive test ordered by the court is perhaps a special kind of candidness. allegations of family violence and mental health the mother made allegations of coercion and control against the father. she goes so far as to suggest his application is coercive and controlling, which is not a supportable contention given the evidence. the mother made a range of allegations in this regard yet conceded she had been physically violent towards the father whilst drug-affected. the father explained the matters that resulted in his criminal charge against the mother. on any account, the situation was poorly handled by both of the parties, something which the mother appears unable to acknowledge. more helpfully, the mother can point to no behaviour at all or a single message she says is family violence in the last 2 years in her evidence. the mother also suggested that the father had been aggressive to medical professionals and had threatened her. the medical records of the various practices produced under subpoena were produced. they disclosed nothing of the mother’s allegations on repeated occasions- which was put to the mother despite her submissions. it is simply unbelievable that the father’s behaviour if threatening, would not have been recorded by the medical professionals when they recorded details of their conversations with the father in their records. the mother further alleged the father had been physically violent towards the child. the court could not have accepted this evidence. the mother appeared to at no point have reflected on the gravity of her allegations, how she says disclosures were made to her or the lack of physical signs of what was disclosed, most notably the obvious problem with her [140] allegation concerning hands around the throat of the child. the mother had mental health issues during the relationship and thereafter, to the point that she was admitted into a psychiatric facility. to characterise concerns about the mother’s mental health as ‘wild’ or ‘pure speculation’ as the mother does is a significant overreach that fails to appreciate the evidence. the mother’s illicit drug abuse the mother addressed, in an unsatisfactory way, her relapse into illicit drug abuse. the mother had minimal support in addressing her drug issues and failed to address in a substantial way significant holes in her case. the mother led no real evidence in her [146] about what being ‘significantly affected’ by [illicit drugs] meant the risk it posed to her child or why knowing that she decided to reengage in illicit drug use. the best the mother did was to say she used [drugs] when stressed and overwhelmed and her child was having surgery. the mother did that when she had an application before the court for the child to live with her. to be blunt, she had everything to lose and still chose to take illicit drugs because she was ‘stressed’. the mother did not address why she would not further relapse, did not address her repeated refusal to do hair follicle testing in late 2022 at the request of the father’s solicitors, and brought no expert evidence to the court to justify her claims concerning her limited periods of use, and failed even in submissions to address the impact of potential future illicit drug use on the child. the court would be very concerned that the mother’s attitude at best appears to be ‘nothing to see here’ or ‘hair follicle testing will solve it’ when the mother has acted in the manner she has when an application has been before the court, and future breach of orders (about which the mother’s track record is hardly stellar) would potentially mean a change of residence of the child away from the mother if the mother achieved her objective. the lack of consideration and care for the child displayed by such a position points squarely towards the mother’s lack of insight into the child and the child’s best interests. allegations of medical neglect the mother alleged the father medically neglected the child. the mother maintained this in the witness box. the mother brought not a single piece of medical evidence in this regard yet threw a serious allegation without any proper foundation. the mother never considered herself hypervigilant in this regard but steadfastly maintained her allegations even in the light of objective evidence, such as there being no record at all from daycare expressing even the slightest concern about the father's medical treatment of the child. further, the mother's own evidence suggested a level of hypervigilance where at [62], she took a child to a hospital because the child sounded congested with a runny nose and a cough and was tired. the further double standard of taking a child to the hospital for [an illness] but leaving because it was taking too long on her own [101] was similarly troubling. if further evidence of the mother's hyperbole was needed, one can observe that the [b contact service] contact reports do not reflect even the mother's allegations [76]. the truth is perhaps best summed up by the mother's attitude at [158] of the father's affidavit, where she alleged the child suffers abdominal pain because she hates her father. the evidence of the family consultant the evidence of [ms v] was of assistance. the mother's submissions imply that [ms v]'s evidence should be disregarded because they fail to deal with it entirely. key amongst [ms v]'s evidence are the following matters: - the mother's proposal would be hugely disruptive for the child, the father is the child's sense of home and safe space, and it is important she has ongoing stability in his care, there was no advantage or reason to change the parent with whom the child lives, the father's proposal would be indicated if there was a belief mother would not comply with orders. indeed, the benefit to the child of a meaningful relationship depended on the mother's ability to comply with orders, that the mother had accepted, she was violent to the father whilst using [illicit drugs] and might do so in the future, the mother's behaviour posed a number of risks that were corrosive to the child's well-being, the mother has significant vulnerabilities as a parent, the concern about unsupervised time is that the mother would communicate her concerns to the child. this would have a damaging effect on this child, particularly given her confusing and disrupted young life, that the father's proposal was not one that would be no relationship, but there would be a restricted relationship, and for orders other than the father's to be made, the court would need to assess the mother as having a significant willingness to comply with them. the evidence of the father the father’s evidence was open and honest. he made concessions that he did not have to make and was open to alternatives to his position whilst remaining firm that his position was still in the child’s best interests. his ability to think of the child in that manner marked him out in a notable way from the mother’s approach and pointed away from many of the mother’s contentions regarding him. he answered questions directly in the face of a range of quite forceful allegations. parental responsibility sole parental responsibility should fall to the father. the parties cannot communicate and meet the requirements for s 61da to operate as set out in marvel & marvel (no 2) [2010] famcafc 101. meaningful relationship the father asserts that the child will not benefit from a meaningful relationship with the mother. he asserts this because of the mother’s attitude towards complaints with orders and the consequent disruption to the child as outlined in the evidence of [ms v]. the father does not seek that there be ‘no relationship’ (as the mother asserts in submissions against the expert evidence, for unexplained reasons) but that there be a restricted relationship so the child can know her mother in a safe environment. the father suggests that given the child does know her mother and is in her tender years, this relationship should continue in some form, but that the difficulties posed by the mother and her attitude point directly toward the need for protection and the exceptional circumstances outlined in malburon & waldlow [2013] famcafc 191. risks the balance of risk points towards the father's proposal. there are several complex risks in this matter set out in the case outline of the father and addressed above. the most prominent risks are the risk of serious psychological harm falling within the definition of abuse to the child of being exposed to further conflict between the parties, the risk to the child of the mother's inability to manage her behaviours surrounding allegations and witholding of the child, and the risk posed to the child of serious psychological harm arising from the mother's parenting style. dealing with the first risk, the parties are entangled in conflict. the distrust and conflict between them are epitomised in the manner in which the mother pursued her case. that case showed a remarkable lack of insight and consideration of the child and a total failure to address the expert evidence. those matters are then observed against the background of the evidence of the lack of conflict management skills between each of the parties. when all those matters and those above are considered, the court could have little faith that the distrust between the parties has diminished or that the mother has acquired the skills and ability to minimise the potential for ongoing conflicts between them and actually bother to comply with court orders. that stands against the practical reality of the mother's and the icl's proposal- she will simply choose not to comply in the future when she wants to. the more time the mother spends with the child, the more need for interaction and organisation is required between the parents as a matter of practicality and the more opportunities for the mother to find any excuse she can to breach orders causing yet more chaos in the life of the child. it follows that there is greater interaction and a greater potential for conflict, which is enjoined to any extension of the mother's time and that time being unsupervised. in the event that the mother was able to demonstrate significant and sustained changes in her attitudes the case would be different- it is not demonstrated in either her oral evidence, her written evidence, and it is certainly not demonstrated in her submissions. in that regard, the court should follow the expert view that a finding that the mother has no real change in attitude to comply with court orders points towards the father’s orders. likely effect on the child the father says that the likely effect of the mother’s proposal on the child is a significant disruption that would then, over time, transition to a period where the child is mired in conflict between the parents. conversely, the father’s proposal is manageable for the child. brief responses to the mother’s submissions the idea that the evidence before the court concerning the mother’s relapse was ‘pure speculation’ is undermined when that evidence was led from the court child expert. it is difficult to know how the father was supposed to lead that evidence where the mother refused requests for hair follicle testing, and the mother failed to produce any expert evidence to verify her claims. to suggest that it was for the father to address these matters is to misunderstand the onus of proof. the submission in paragraph 41 is difficult to understand, where the mother did not give any evidence of her day-to-day care of the child and had not had that care for a significant period of time. the observation was unhelpful. the idea at [42] that the mother’s relationship with the child is ‘entirely appropriate in all respects’ and that ‘[x] is the person seeking to extend time with the mother’ is not supported by the family report or the expert evidence. further, it disturbingly echoes the mother’s position that somehow, the child, at a very tender age, should get to decide matters. the submission at [43] is misplaced. the expert evidence in the family report and in the extensive cross-examination of the expert founded the father’s case. whilst the mother completely ignores the evidence of the court child expert because it does not assist her, it is not open to claim that the father’s position is ‘without any expert evidence’. the mother's submissions fail to explain why the disruption she proposes and the limitation of the father’s relationship with the child is somehow in the child’s best interests. the approach of identifying risks and suggesting the mother has dealt with them hardly warrants the mother’s orders, even on their best day. the suggestion, therefore, ultimately arrived at [51], was not only unsupported by the expert, but tellingly, it was not put to the expert by the mother. further, the submission concealed the long period the mother did not see the child because she chose not to see the child because of the submission's use of particular dates. conclusion the respondent says that the appropriate orders are those he seeks.

orders sought amended minutes of orders sought by the, icl were provided to the court and other parties on 16 november 2023. a further copy of the orders sought by the icl is attached. the position of each parent is polarised with each parent seeking sole parental responsibility for [x] in their respective favour, that [x] live with them and that she spend limited time with the other parent. the applicant mother seeks orders for sole parental responsibility in her favour and that [x] spend 3 nights per fortnight with her father as well as blocks of a week in school holiday periods. the applicant father seeks orders in effect that he has sole parental responsibility, that [x] live him and that [x] spent professionally supervised time with the mother for two hours on four occasions each year. under the orders sought by the father [x] would not maintain a meaningful relationship with her mother. the position of the parties there is no question that each parent loves [x] and each seeks what they consider to be in [x]’s best interest. unfortunately, they are at polar extremes in their respective views of what is in her best interest. concerning the orders sought by the mother, the icl, to be blunt, submits that there is little to no evidentiary basis to support a position where court could make orders as sought by the mother. to the contrary, it is submitted that if the court were to make orders as sought by the mother [x] would be at unacceptable risk in multiple respects, including, but not necessarily limited to: possibility of harm through exposure to illicit drug use or the effects of illicit drug use by the mother. possibility of harm through exposure to mental health episodes or generally poor mental health by the mother. psychological abuse through repeated allegations of abuse towards the father and consequential medical, police and child protection investigations. psychological and possibly physical harm through frequent and unnecessary medical investigations and interventions. psychological harm through withholding of [x] from the father in contravention of court orders. psychological harm through exposure of [x] to negative views and statements about the father by the mother. further, while the mother attempts to minimise and answer the allegations of unacceptable risk to [x] in her care, she does not address in any effective way why the orders sought by the mother for [x] to live with her and for the mother to have sole parental responsibility is in [x]’s best interest or why such arrangements should be preferred over the existing stable arrangements of living with her father. [x] has now been in the primary care of the father since at least july 2021. that arrangement for [x] is stable and the relationship between herself and her father is positive. the court would accept that she is well cared for by her father. such a significant change of living arrangements as those sought by the mother would not be [x]’s best interest. the position concerning the orders sought by the father is more complex. the concerns expressed by the father about risk to [x] in the mother’s care are understandable and valid. the icl largely concurs with the submissions of the father concerning risk to [x] in the mother’s care. the potential for harm to [x] in the care of her mother is a realistic possibility and the consequences for [x] are potentially severe. the orders sought by the father alleviate the risk to [x] in the care of the mother but at the cost of [x] maintaining a meaningful relationship with her mother. the father’s counsel submits correctly that the orders sought by the father would not result in there being no relationship between [x] and her mother, however the orders sought by the father would result in the loss of a meaningful relationship per section 60cc(2)(a) of the family law act 1975 (“the act”). significantly, the position of the father at trial differed from that expressed to the family report writer, [ms v], during interviews for the report where he expressed a preference for a more generous regime of time between [x] and her mother, “dependent upon the mother’s engagement in mental health services and provision of clear drug tests. indeed, the orders sought by the icl mirror to a large degree the stated time proposals of the father in the family report. the father submits [21] that [x] will not benefit from a meaningful relationship with the mother. the icl does not agree with this submission, nor does evidence before the court, including the expert evidence of the family report writer, support such a submission. again, the submission made on behalf of the father is somewhat at odds with the recorded expressed views of the father during the family report process. the icl submits that there is a benefit to [x] maintaining a meaningful relationship with her mother however any benefit is dependent upon the mother successfully addressing the identified matter of risk. the icl does not criticise the father for the cautious approach to the time [x] spends with her mother, adopted by the father at the hearing and by way of the final orders sought by the father. his concerns about risk factors to [x] in her mother’s care are real and valid. nevertheless, it is submitted that the court can infer that the father does, or at least did at the time of the family report, support [x] having a meaningful relationship with her mother provided that the very real risk factors can be ameliorated effectively. in the recent decision of bielen v kozma [2022] fedcfamc1a 221, (2022) 66 famlr 59, the appeal division (mcclelland dcj, henderson & harper jj) identified that in considering risk it is necessary to also consider: the potential to ameliorate the risk, the measures that are proportionate to the risk, and to consider how the benefits of meaningful relationship with a parent might be able to be retained while dealing with that risk. it is submitted that orders sought by the icl provide measures to ameliorate the risk to [x] posed by her mother in such a way that it enables [x] to have the benefit of an ongoing meaningful relationship with her mother. this is expanded upon further below. matters of unacceptable risk the icl does not propose to address the matters of unacceptable risk to [x] in the care of the mother in detail. the icl agrees with and adopts the submissions on behalf of the father concerning the risk to [x] in her mother’s care. however, the icl does not adopt the father’s submissions as to measures to address that risk. it is submitted that the court would be assisted greatly by the extremely comprehensive appraisal conducted by cyps of some [100+] pages completed in [early] 2023. the icl endorses the analysis and outcome of the appraisal as contained at pages 102 to 111 of the appraisal report. parental responsibility both parties assert that there has been family violence between the parties that would fall within the definition of family violence under the family law act 1975, (“the act”). there have been some three family violence orders issued previously but none currently. it is arguable that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility under s 61da of the act does not apply but the icl does not seek any finding in this regard. rather, and more significantly, the icl submits that there is no evidence that the parents have any ability to communicate such that the sharing of parental responsibility is not, at least at the current time, reasonably practicable or in [x]’s best interest. the absence of trust of the other from either parent is a significant barrier to any effective communication between the parents. each parent accuses the other of acting unilaterally without reference to the other parent. the reality is that there is not currently a level of trust between the parents or effective communication between the parents necessary for equal shared parental responsibility to be in [x]’s best interest. [x] is currently in effectively the sole care of the father and has been for a considerable time. the evidence strongly suggests that the father has made appropriate decisions concerning [x]’s wellbeing. unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the mother, however well-intentioned her decisions may have been. the evidence strongly indicates the mother has subjected [x] to multiple unnecessary medical, police and child protection interventions as well as denying her the benefit of a relationship with her father in dubious circumstances. the family report writer was supportive of sole parental responsibility being held by the father. in the absence of the exercise of shared parental responsibility being reasonably practicable or in [x]’s best interest, sole parental responsibility should be to the father. the mother’s drug use/mental health issues the submissions made on behalf of the mother stress that she asserts that she no longer uses illicit drugs and that the court should draw the inference that “there is no cogent evidence that she is using such drugs”. this submission ignores acknowledged significant drug history and minimised the level of concerns the court would appropriately have about a possibility of future drug use by the mother imposing an unacceptable risk to [x]. the reality is that the mother’s drug use history is long term and extensive. she unfortunately has not been able to refrain from the use of illicit drugs long term despite previously having prior interventions and periods of apparently not using drugs of over 12 months. the mother admitted to cyps to last using drugs ([illicit drugs]) as recently as [late] 2022. contrary to the submission by the mother’s counsel that she candidly admitted to past illicit drug use, the evidence shows her candidness only came about after hair follicle tests [in early] 2023 were positive. until receipt of the positive test she maintained to cyps worker that she last used illicit drugs in [mid]-2021. significantly between [mid]-2022 and [early] 2023 she resisted undertaking drug testing as orders by this court. it is hoped that the mother has finally put her illicit drug use behind her, but on the basis of her historical use and acknowledged current limited professional intervention, the possibility of future use is both a real risk and unacceptable for the safety of [x]. further, the court would appropriately have a real concern whether the mother would voluntarily acknowledge future drug use if she were to relapse. for this reason, any reduction in supervision and/or increase in the time that [x] spends with her mother must be dependent on continuing provision of independent, chain of custody urinalysis results that demonstrate no illicit drug use. such testing will be required for a considerable period of time. the icl seeks such order. the mother also has a long history of mental health difficulties. regardless of what the official diagnosis might or might not be, the court can appropriately find that mental illness has significantly impacted upon the mother in the past, including resulting in an admission to [ae health centre] as recently as [mid]-2021. concerningly, on her own oral evidence the mother’s current or recent attendance for professional support for her mental health appears to be limited, as is her attendance for drug counselling/relapse prevention. the orders sought by the icl seek to ameliorate risks concerning drug use and mental health through continuation of supervision with gradual increase in the time [x] spends with her mother, but more significantly through orders specifically requiring the mother to undergo regular hair follicle drug testing, attendance upon professionals for drug treatment and mental health assistance and provision of regular reports of attendance and engagement from such professionals. medical matters the cyps appraisal of[x] records that medical records showed that the mother had taken [x] to medical practitioners some [100] times between [early] 2022 and [early] 2023. if correct this indicates attendance on medical practitioners at a frequency of greater than one day in every three. notwithstanding that [x] did have respiratory issues in 2022 this is an extraordinary level of medical attendance, particularly given [x] was largely in the father’s care at this time. the icl submits that there is a very real risk that without restrictive orders, the mother will likely subject [x] to frequent unnecessary and intrusive medical examinations and treatments. for this reason, the father should hold sole parental responsibility and there be specific restraints on the mother taking the child to medical practitioners. noncompliance with court orders/retention of [x] the mother has historically repeatedly not complied with court orders and retained [x] in her care on spurious reasons. this includes repeated claims of abuse of [x] by her father where the evidence overwhelmingly established the extreme unlikelihood of any such abuse. of further concern the evidence suggests that the mother has been prepared to embellish what she tells professionals to achieve the outcome she wants. this is apparent when one compares the initial reports she made concerning possible abuse of [x] to cyps in [late] 2022 and interviews with cyps with the very different report she provides to the police [in early] 2023 where she claims [x] told her "he used two fingers, inside and out very fast" and gestured her hand tapping how he did it, before telling [ms lennan] that "it hurt and i cried and i was lying down". despite denial by the mother, [ms v] reaffirmed her evidence in cross-examination that the mother indicated that she would not comply with court orders if she felt that this was not in the best interest of [x]. the court would accept the evidence of [ms v] concerning this. the mother did retreat from this position in her evidence and agreed she would in future comply with court orders. in this regard the ball is entirely in her court, if she does not comply [x] will not spend meaningful time with her. the orders sought by the icl ameliorate this risk through initially continuing supervised time and gradually increasing the time that [x] spends with her mother while compliance with orders is monitored. conclusion it is submitted that the evidence overall is that while the potential risks to [x] in her mother’s care are real and serious, a gradual reduction of supervision and progression of the time [x] spends with the mother is in [x]’s best interest providing those risks can be ameliorated. it is submitted that overall, the orders sought by the icl best meet the interests of [x].
the cyps appraisal of [x] records that medical records showed that the mother had taken [x] to medical practitioners some [100] times between [early] 2022 and [early] 2023. if correct this indicates attendance on medical practitioners at a frequency of greater than one day in every three. notwithstanding that [x] did have respiratory issues in 2022 this is an extraordinary level of medical attendance, particularly given [x] was largely in the father’s care at this time.
outline of principle
... maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents, obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement having been incurred.  4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. "[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms." because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be "best" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing.
on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.” on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.   the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(2))  ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s 60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues:
the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility.  ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words “meaningful involvement”. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting:
the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements.  ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]–[199]):  6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) — (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than “1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays” or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve “both” parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children.  ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system”. “meaning” is defined as “having intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)”. a second definition is “conveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive”. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines “meaning” (in generalised use) as “significance”. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as “full of meaning, significant”. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as “expressive or significant: a meaning look”. [26] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
i am conscious that a long-distance relationship, with longer but less frequent times spent together, is inevitably different from a relationship where people live closer together with regular face-to-face contact. but it does not itself mean it cannot be meaningful.
we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o’ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]:
the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a “meaningful relationship” with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court’s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child’s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider “the benefit to the child” of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j’s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original)
the full court also observed at [191]: “the first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression ‘meaningful relationship’ is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a ‘meaningful relationship’ ”.  7] for our part, we echo the view expressed by the trial judge of the serious nature of depriving the father of contact in circumstances where that appears to have been engineered by the mother, without any fault on the part of the father at all. this cannot be in a child's best interests. [178] it also does not appear to us to be appropriate for a parent to be able to manipulate the family law system to such an extent that the other parent's hope of ever seeing the child again, rests upon the possibility that she may wish to seek him out in later adolescence or adulthood. [179] we think that a family court would not be doing its duty if it were to simply give in to these sorts of considerations, except in the most extreme case and only then, when a positive determination is made that the welfare of the child requires it.
given the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the court must consider the conduct of the parents, not with a view to rewarding one or punishing the other, but to ascertain from such conduct whether the welfare of the child will be better served in the custody of one or the other.

findings – appraisal risk assessment substantiated abuse / neglect and any previous interventions and outcomes in the last 12 months nil in the last 12 months. emotional abuse causing significant harm was substantiated in [...] with [ms lennan] identified as the person believed responsible. aboriginal and/or torres straight islander or cultural information neither aboriginal or torres straight islander. religious or other considerations [ms lennan] has stated that she is catholic. ... have you interviewed the child/ren and or young person/s separately from the parents and their siblings? yes if so, when? [early] 2023 ... what are the views and wishes of the child/ren and or young person/s? [x] spoke about liking the colour [...] and using a stapler to staple. [x] said her best friend's name is [...]. [x] also spoke about spending time with her cousins at the pool. [x]’s favourite tv show is [...]. [x] was asked what fun things she does with mummy and she said "playing". [x] spoke about playing [sports] with her father. [x] explained she was sick when she was being interviewed because she had "germs" in her chest. [x] spoke about needing surgery and that mum told her she's having surgery. during the interview [x] identified her parents and paternal aunt [ms ad] as people she would tell if she was feeling sad or something was wrong. provide an analysis of the child/ren’s or young person/s exposure to risk including analysis of the opportunity for abuse or neglect child protection history a total of 39 reports have been received and this is the third appraisal in respect of [x]. the reported concerns have included [x]’s mother's illicit substance misuse, mother's mental health, family and domestic violence, sexual abuse. in an appraisal completed in 2021, emotional abuse was substantiated with [x]’s mother identified as the person believed responsible. the most recent reports are in relation to allegations that [x] has been sexually abused, [x]’s mother taking [x] to get vaginal swabs and [x] reportedly disclosing sexual abuse to her mother. it is important to note that there is also a child protection history for [x] in nsw and the nsw department of communities and justice substantiated physical abuse: dangerous behaviour involving child/young person (dv) following an incident in [mid]-2020 where [x]’s mother continued to hit [x]’s father whilst [x] was in her father's arms. family makeup [ms lennan] and [mr gillivray] are the parents of [x]. at the time of appraisal commencement, there was a shared care arrangement where [x]spent part of the week with [ms lennan] and the remainder of the week with [mr gillivray] as per the family law court order. on 20 january 2023, a new family law court order was made which stipulated [mr gillivray] has sole parental responsibility for [x] and that [x] lives with [mr gillivray]. the order further stipulates "the mother be permitted to send cards and written notes to the child via the father." when [x] spends time in [mr gillivray]'s care, [x] regularly sees her paternal aunt [ms ad] and cousins. [ms ad] assists in taking [x] to childcare and [x] participates in family activities with her cousins ([ms ad]’s children). current situation there are four child concern reports which have met the threshold for appraisal and are assessed in this appraisal. all of the reports are in relation to [x] experiencing emotional abuse, sexual abuse and physical abuse. the reports for sexual and physical abuse were sent to the afp for consideration but were not accepted for investigation. the first report leading to appraisal was received [in late] 2022 and signed off for appraisal [in early] 2023. the reported concerns were in relation to [x] being taken to a medical practitioner by [ms lennan] [in late] 2022 where [ms lennan] raised the concern that [x] had been sexually abused by her father. [ms lennan] had reportedly noted some redness and discharge at [x]'s genitals. the report notes that [ms lennan] completed a genital swab at home on [x] and obtained a urine sample from [x]. these samples were tested for sexually transmitted infections (stis) including chlamydia and gonorrhoea. it is evidenced in information received in response to s862 request to [q] medical centre that [x] did not test positive to any stis. upon commencement of the appraisal, cyps referred [x] to the [l organisation] given the reported concerns. however, [l organisation] was unable to complete a forensic medical examination of [x] due to the significant passing of time between the report being received by cyps and rated for appraisal. it was also noted by [ms ag] (clinical nurse consultant at [l organisation]) that the reported concerns mirror those in a referral to [l organisation] by cyps completed in 2021 where similar concerns were raised by [ms lennan] in relation to [x] being sexually abused by [mr gillivray]. [dr ah] completed the examination of [x] in 2021 and no concerns were noted by [dr ah] in relation to [x] experiencing sexual abuse. the second report was received [in late] 2022 and signed off for appraisal [in early] 2023. the reported concerns were in relation to [x] reportedly disclosing that [mr gillivray] used his fingers when cleaning her "bum area" and [x] reportedly rubbed her nipples when stating "daddy did this". it is further noted in the report that [ms lennan] stated to the reporter that [x] stated [mr gillivray] hits her and withholds medication from her. [ms lennan] also told the reporter that [x] has said she does not want to go back to [mr gillivray]’s home. further information received from the nsw department of communities and justice in relation to this report notes concerns in relation to [ms lennan] gambling, using [illicit drugs], avoidance of drug testing, spinning stories to police, doctor shopping. the third report was received [in early] 2023 and signed off for appraisal [in early] 2023. the reported concerns were in relation to [ms lennan] disclosing to the report that [x] became distressed and closed her legs when [ms lennan] attempted to put cream on her vagina. [ms lennan] told the reporter that [x] made a disclosure that her father touched her vagina and her inside. it is further reported that [x] told her father no. in the reported information it was noted that [x] made a second disclosure to [ms lennan] when she tried to put ointment on [x]'s vagina on another occasion. the fourth report was received [in early] 2023 and signed off for appraisal [in early] 2023. the reported concerns were in relation to [x] disclosing that "dad hit me" on her face. [x] also stated that she was "sicky" in the "bum" and said that her father touched her "bottom" when asked if anyone touched her bottom or bum. it was further noted by the reporter that [x]'s mother had completed four vaginal swabs on [x] with the most recent being the week prior. upon commencement of the appraisal, [x] was in the care of her father. [x] was interviewed [in early] 2023 separate from her parents with a support person present (paternal aunt [ms ad]). following the interview with [x], a safety plan was put into place for [x] to remain in the care of her paternal aunt [ms ad] whilst cyps assessed the sexual abuse allegations in respect of [mr gillivray]. once cyps had assessed that it was unlikely that [x] had experienced sexual abuse or was at risk of sexual abuse, cyps engaged in safety planning with [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] to remain in [mr gillivray]'s care due to concerns in relation to [ms lennan] potentially exposing [x] to further invasive genital swabs and [ms lennan] continuing to take photos of [x]'s genitals. it is noted that cyps first became aware of [ms lennan] taking photos of [x]'s genitals in 2021 and cyps asked [ms lennan] at that time to cease taking photos of [x]'s genitals. consequences of abuse / neglect this appraisal is assessing concerns in relation to the physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse of [x]. [x] is four years old and is completely reliant on her caregivers to ensure her daily care needs are met and she is protected from abuse and/or neglect. the intrinsic characteristics of a child of [x]'s age which would increase vulnerability are: • "taking on a sense of responsibility and personal connection with negative life events • challenging authority figures as a part of their healthy, autonomous behaviour • clinging to a carer because of feelings of insecurity and reluctance to explore their environment" (risk assessment framework cyps, p. 49). physical abuse [x] disclosed during the interview [in early] 2023 that [mr gillivray] hit her on the face but was unable to provide any clarifying information when asked. this information was referred to the afp but not accepted for investigation. [mr gillivray] was interviewed in relation to the physical abuse concerns [in early] 2023 where he said, "i would never do something like that". [mr gillivray] also spoke about a time that he picked [x] up from [ms lennan] and [x] said to him "daddy hits you doesn't he". [mr gillivray] said he responded by saying to [x] that he loved her but [x] then continued on to say "mummy loves you, daddy doesn't". [mr gillivray] also said during the interview that he doesn't believe anyone else would have hit [x] but knows that when [ms lennan] is using she punches walls and throws things. [mr gillivray] spoke time out as a possible behaviour management strategy to use with [x] but said he never has had to use it because [x] is generally a "well behaved girl". records received from [ms lennan]'s psychologist [ms aj] evidence that [ms lennan] told [ms aj] [mid]-2022 that, "[x] disclosed to her ([ms lennan]) a few times her father had hit her". although it may be concerning that [x] said [mr gillivray] hit her on the face, there is insufficient evidence to corroborate that this has occurred. it is noted that reports have been received in 2022 where it has been alleged [x]'s mother has asked [x] about her father hitting her which is believed to bring about [x] stating her father hit her on her face. it is unclear whether [x] may have been hit on her face in the past or whether this is something her mother may have discussed with her. at this time, there is insufficient information to assess that [x] has experienced physical abuse or is at significant risk of physical abuse. therefore, the future risk of physical abuse at this time is assessed as unlikely. sexual abuse the sexual abuse allegations received by cyps which led to this appraisal were referred to the afp and an investigation was commenced. however, the afp advised cyps [in early] 2023 that "police do not hold reasonable suspicion that any offence has occurred." during the interview [in early] 2023, [x] also spoke about [mr gillivray] touching her bottom when she was wearing "jammies" and the sun was shining. when asked about [mr gillivray] putting cream on her "bum", [x] said yes. earlier in the interview [x] identified on a body chart that she calls her vulva/ vagina her "bum" and calls her bottom, her "back bottom" or "bottom". during the interview with [mr gillivray] [in early] 2023, [mr gillivray] was not surprised by the sexual abuse allegations as he stated that this has happened before. [mr gillivray] said he has engaged with police during the most recent investigation and is happy for [x] to attend [af medical service] for a medical assessment if it is required. [mr gillivray] stated he has not sexually abused [x] but does have to assist [x] with wiping her bottom and applying the prescription cream for [x] provided to him by [ms lennan] (it is noted in records from [q] medical centre that a cream is used on [x]'s bottom). [mr gillivray] stated he believes that [ms lennan] is trying to create a paper trail by going to the doctors and requesting swabs in order to make a new application to the family law court. as it was reported that [x] has disclosed sexual abuse to [ms lennan] on more than one occasion, [ms lennan] was interviewed in relation to the sexual abuse concerns [in early] 2023. [ms lennan] stated she first became aware that [x] may have been sexually abused in [late] 2022. however, child protection records evidence that [ms lennan] has raised similar concerns in relation to [x] being sexually abused in 2021. [ms lennan] said she took [x] to the gp who provided her with a medical certificate in order to not return [x] to [mr gillivray]'s care due to [ms lennan] relaying the concerns of sexual abuse. [ms lennan] confirmed that she completed a genital swab on [x] at home. [ms lennan] recalled that the next occasion that she became worried about sexual abuse was [in early] 2023 when [x] was reportedly apprehensive to take off her clothes, wash her or wipe her. [ms lennan] said she asked [x], "how's your [...] ([ms lennan]'s word for vagina)?" and [x] told her it was fine now sore but [ms lennan] observed [x] to be walking funny and holding her groin. [x] then reportedly disclosed to [ms lennan] that [mr gillivray] uses his fingers but not to clean her. [ms lennan] spoke about noticing discharge on [x]'s genitals and taking photos of the discharge on [x]'s genitals as "evidence". at this point, [ms lennan] was advised not to take photos of [x]'s genitals and it was explained how it could be considered child abuse material. during the interview with [ms lennan] it was raised why [ms lennan] did not take [x] to emergency or go to police sooner about her concerns of [x] being sexually abused. [ms lennan] explained that she was trying to do the right thing by going to the gp and that she took photos as "evidence". [x]'s medical records from [q] medical centre evidence that [x] was taken to the gp on the following dates and the following tests were completed: [late] 2022 - urine test for uti, chlamydia and gonorrhoea and vaginal swab [late] 2022 - urine test for uti and vulva swab [late] 2022 - urine and faeces test due to abdominal pains [early] 2023 - urine test and vaginal swab for gonorrhoea and chlamydia [x]'s medical records evidence that [x] was not diagnosed with sti or a uti but with [x] was diagnosed with an anaerobic infection as a result of gut and bowel flora/material contamination while [x] was wiping her bottom. the doctor asked [ms lennan] to assist [x] with her perineal hygiene. it is noted in [dr ak]’s notes dated [early] 2023 that [ms lennan] "brought photos of child's perineal area today". at this time, there is insufficient evidence that [x] has been sexually abused by [mr gillivray]. although it cannot be fully excluded, it is unlikely that it has occurred as concerns in relation to [x]'s genitals was a result of gut and bowel flora/ material contamination which can occur in young girls due to not being fully proficient at wiping their bottom. it remains unclear whether [x] has the expressive language skills to make the disclosures to [ms lennan] as [ms lennan] has reported. however, it is concerning that there appears to be an emerging pattern of reporting in relation to sexual abuse allegations since 2021. in addition, it is highly concerning that [ms lennan] has undertaken vaginal swabs on [x] at home at the request of gp and taken photos of [x]'s genitals. [the police officer] who completed the investigation into the sexual abuse allegations stated, "i would share the concerns about subjecting [x] to unnecessary and overly invasive medical procedures.". if [ms lennan] continues to complete vaginal swabs and take photos of [x]'s genitals, it is likely that this will result in the emotional abuse of [x] or could be considered sexually abusive behaviour by [ms lennan]. it is concerning that [ms lennan] continued to take photos of [x]'s genitals for "evidence" despite this being addressed with [ms lennan] in an appraisal in 2021. although it is likely [ms lennan] did not take the photos for the purposes of producing child abuse material, the photos do not assist cyps in determining whether sexual abuse has occurred. at this juncture, it is noted that [ms lennan] completed the swabs herself in consultation with medical professionals. therefore, sexual abuse will not be substantiated. emotional abuse reported concerns in relation to emotional abuse include [ms lennan]’s history of [illicit drugs] use, [ms lennan] engaging in doctor shopping for [x] and gambling. during the interview with [ms lennan] [in early] 2023, [ms lennan] advised that she has not used [illicit drugs] since [mid]-2021 and the main influence in her drug use was [mr al] (known links to [bikie gangs]). [ms lennan] discussed previously being in a relationship with [mr al] and the seeking an fvo due family violence perpetrated by [mr al]. [ms lennan] stated that [mr al] is now in [prison] and they no longer communicate. [ms lennan] has provided cyps with a copy of the fvo. in addition, cyps received records from [city k] corrections which confirm that [ms lennan] has not been in contact with [mr al] whilst he has been in [prison] this year. [ms lennan] has made it clear that she does want to resume her relationship with [mr al] as she recognised it would impact her job and relationship with [x]. it is noted [ms lennan] raised concerns in relation to historic incidents of domestic violence allegedly perpetrated by [mr gillivray] which were not the focus of this appraisal. [mr gillivray] did acknowledge on one occasion becoming heightened during a handover and smash [ms lennan]'s phone when she was filming him. [mr gillivray] acknowledges this should not have occurred. during the appraisal, cyps became aware that [ms lennan] had not completed drug testing in accordance with the family law court order in respect of [x]. cyps asked [ms lennan] whether she would consider completing a hair strand test paid for and arranged by cyps as it the cost was identified as a barrier for completing the test. [ms lennan] completed the hair strand test [in early] 2023. the results evidenced that [ms lennan] has used [illicit drugs] between [mid]-2022 and [early] 2023. [in early] 2023, [ms lennan] confirmed that she used [illicit drugs] but not on an ongoing basis. [ms lennan] said she uses during difficult periods and only when [x] is in [mr gillivray]'s care. following cyps providing [ms lennan] with the results, [ms lennan] sought her own hair strand test which is reportedly negative for all substance. cyps cannot confirm the integrity of the collection and results as [ms lennan] did not provide cyps with an expert report but only the results. in addition, it is not clear what the cut offs were for the detection of substances in the hair strand testing which [ms lennan] undertook independently. therefore, this report does not rule out [ms lennan]'s use of [illicit drugs]. in addition, it is noted in the expert report dated [early] 2023 (for the hair strand test arranged by cyps) that the hair sample collected was 38cm long and the sample reportedly collected for [ms lennan]'s independent hair strand test was 0 - 3.9cm long. although the author is not a forensic scientist, it is highly likely that the length of the hair sample provide also impacts the detection of substances. as part of the appraisal, cyps requested [x]'s medicare records. the medicare records evidence [x] has presented to medical professionals on 9[5] occasions since [early] 2022. it is also evidenced in medical records from [q] medical centre that [ms lennan] also takes [x] to a gp in [suburb am]. [mr gillivray] also confirmed that he takes [x] to a gp in [suburb an]. it is apparent that there is no agreement between [ms lennan] and [mr gillivray] about which medical practice to take [x] to see a gp despite an undertaking made by both parents to the family law court to take [x] to a single gp. it is likely that [x] would benefit from consistently visiting a single gp practice to allow for continuity in her medical care. it would also be beneficial for [x] not to be unduly exposed to invasive medical procedures and it is possible that the risk of this occurring would be reduced if [x] saw a single medical practitioner. this risk would also be reduced if [x] was taken to the emergency department for any concerns of sexual abuse rather than [ms lennan] waiting and taking [x] to a gp to request sti swabs. [ms lennan] reports that she has previously been diagnosed with [mental health conditions]. [ms lennan] said she has since seen a psychologist and now has no diagnosis of [a mental health condition] but has a form of depression from when cyps was last involved and [x] was not in her care. [ms lennan] spoke about the depression being situational. [ms lennan] explained that she last saw a psychologist [ms aj] three months ago. records received from [ms aj’s] evidence that [ms lennan] last attended an appointment [in late] 2022 and has had 11 sessions in total with [ms aj] since [mid]-2021. in the records from [ms aj], it is evidenced that [ms lennan] has a diagnosis of [a mental health condition], has engaged with gambling anonymous and reportedly ceased gambling. in a letter from [ac organisation] dated [early] 2023, it is confirmed that [ms lennan] sought assistance for managing her personal finances. records received from [ab] hospital evidence that [ms lennan] also attended three psychology sessions [in late] 2022 with [ms ao] due to concerns in relation the impact of [ms lennan] and [mr gillivray]'s separation on [x] and [mr gillivray]'s behaviour during handovers. it is noted by [ms ao] that no therapy was conducted. the risk of emotional abuse is assessed as concerning at this time. based on the information gathered during the appraisal, it is evident that [ms lennan] has at times sought support in relation to her mental health and past gambling. it is unclear if it has had a discernible impact on [x] resulting in emotional abuse causing significant harm. due to [x]’s limited expressive language, it is also unclear whether she has been exposed to [ms lennan]'s substance misuse or the affects of [ms lennan] withdrawing from [illicit drugs]. it is likely that if [ms lennan] does not address her substance misuse that there is the potential for [x] to experience cumulative harm. this is due to not only the risk of exposure to substance misuse but also the impacts of substance misuse on [ms lennan]'s parenting. factors that increase or decrease the probability of abuse/ neglect the probability of abuse/ neglect reoccurring is assessed as likely. this is due to there being protective factors present for [x] which include her regular attendance at childcare when in her father's care and time spent with [ms ad] and her cousins. however, these factors do not mitigate the risk of abuse/ neglect but increase the likelihood of it being reported. increase • [x]'s age and stage of development means she is reliant on her caregivers to ensure her protection • [ms lennan] has previously been substantiated for the emotional abuse of [x] • [ms lennan's illicit drugs] misuse • [ms lennan]'s diagnoses of [mental health conditions] • allegations of [mr al] and [mr gillivray] perpetrating domestic violence towards [ms lennan] • [ms lennan] maintaining relationship with unsafe adults, i.e. persons connected to [motorcycle gangs] • the impact of the parents' acrimonious relationship on [x] at handover and other times decrease • the involvement of extended family in [x]'s life • [mr gillivray] has supportive family members • [ms lennan] has supportive friends from work • [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] have ongoing employment • [x] attends childcare when in [mr gillivray]'s care • no information to indicate [mr gillivray] misuses substances • both parents have a regular care routine for [x] provide an analysis of the parent’s capacity to protect parent’s attitude towards the abuse and/or neglect both [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] were observed to display concern about the allegations leading to this appraisal. it was noted that [mr gillivray] was not surprised by the sexual abuse and physical abuse allegations as he said these allegations have been previously made and also investigated by police. [ms lennan] was observed to be very focused on the sexual abuse allegations and gathering "evidence", i.e. [ms lennan] taking photos of [x]'s genitals. [ms lennan] was not observed to understand how taking photos of [x]'s genitals and arranging multiple genital/ vaginal swabs may impact on [x]. [mr gillivray] was aware of [ms lennan] taking [x] to have swabs completed prior to the appraisal commencing. it is unclear if [mr gillivray] addressed this with [ms lennan] or raised concerns with [ms lennan] in relation to this occurring. [ms lennan] is likely to be in the contemplation stage in relation to the emotional abuse concerns and the potential impact on [x]. although it is evident [ms lennan] has engaged in therapy at regular intervals, it is unlikely that this would reduce the risk to [x] unless [ms lennan] is honest and open with her therapist regarding her substance misuse and her own challenges. parents relationship with the child both [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] clearly expressed their care, love and concern for [x]. [ms lennan] was not observed together with [x] during the appraisal period due to [x] not being in her care. both parents prioritised [x] during the appraisal by engaging in safety planning and being forthcoming in the information they provided to cyps. no concerns have been identified in relation to either parents' ability to meet [x]'s daily care needs. however, it is likely that [x]'s relationship with her parents would be impacted if [x] were to be made privy to adult conversations or issues raised by one parent about the other. it is concerning that [mr gillivray] reports [x] making negative remarks about him whilst in the car. [x] did not talk about any worries or problems with either parent during her interview. [x] was able to speak about what she liked doing with each parent. parents relationship with each other at this time, [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] do not have a co-parenting relationship where they can discuss their approaches to parenting or worries in respect of [x]. [ms lennan] has identified concerns in relation to her past experience of domestic and family violence reportedly perpetrated by [mr gillivray] which is likely to impact any co-parenting relationship [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] would have into the future. based on interviews with [mr gillivray], it is apparent that he is not surprised when allegations are raised in relation to him by [ms lennan] due to this occurring on a number of occasions. it is likely that a formal agreement in relation to [x]'s care is needed to reduce the possibility of further conflict and to promote consistency and stability in [x]'s routine/ care arrangements. functioning of parents in this appraisal, concerns have been raised in respect of [mr gillivray] perpetrating physical and sexual abuse to [x]. however, concerns in relation to [mr gillivray]'s functioning as a parents have not been identified. [mr gillivray] ensures [x] spends time with extended family and participates in childcare whilst in his care. [mr gillivray] also takes [x] to the gp as required. it is likely that [ms lennan]'s functioning as a parent is impacted by her [illicit drugs] misuse and mental health. it remains possible that [x] may have been exposed to [ms lennan] using or withdrawing from substances. due to [x]'s young age, it is unlikely that [x] would be able to communicate this to others. there are several risk factors if [ms lennan] is using [illicit drugs] or drug affected whilst [x] is in her care. there is the risk that [ms lennan] may not be able to respond to [x] appropriately or be emotionally available for [x] if substance affected or managing her own "come down". it is known that [illicit drugs] can result in "crashing" or sleeping heavily which could leave [x] with limited supervision. it is possible that [ms lennan's illicit drugs] misuse and mental health contribute to her worry about [x] experiencing sexual abuse. however, this would required further independent assessment. strengths • [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] have both expressed affection for [x] • insufficient evidence that [mr gillivray] and/ or [ms lennan] use physical discipline with [x] • neither [mr gillivray] nor [ms lennan] are experiencing long term poverty as they both have employment • [ms lennan] has demonstrated that she is able to access formal support services protective factors • [x] attends childcare regularly when in [mr gillivray]'s care • [x] regularly spends time with her paternal aunt who is an alternative and consistent caring adult in her life • [mr gillivray] and [ms lennan] both have a consistent source of income and maintain good physical standards in their respective homes. appraisal outcome – summary findings is there a reasonable belief that any of the subject person/s has been abused or neglected in the context of the current appraisal allegations?

[x] needs her parents to be able to regulate their emotions and ensure adult conversations are not occurring in her presence, additionally have one identified doctor to ensure they have all the information to make an informed decision about [x]’s health. from the information gathered in the appraisal i am satisfied the father is a parent who is both willing and able to provide care and protection to [x]. therefore, cyps intervention is no longer warranted. approval completed? yes date approval completed?
