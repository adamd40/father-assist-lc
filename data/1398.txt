reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
i would agree to larger superannuation contribution to the financial settlement to reduce the loan amount required for financial settlement.[6]
i propose the fair and equal division of the available property pool in consideration of our thirteen years relationship and respective financial and non-financial contributions to the marriage by myself and the applicant father.[7]
background
when asked about his time spent living in his mother’s care, [x] stated, “awful, to be honest, when alone. i’m not saying she’s totally at fault, but there would always be an argument, i hated it. then dad and mum would argue, and i got sick of it’. he felt that his mother was more to blame for the arguments shared between mother and son, and that from his perspective “mum always seemed to want to fight, i don’t know if it was entertaining for her”. he added that his parents were both responsible for the arguments between the parties, “but dad never wanted it to happen. when it did, he would walk to the [back yard] for alone time then mum would accuse him of being a coward saying he was ‘hiding in [the back yard]. then she would pick on me”. [x] recalled that the worst experience he had with his mother was when she bit him on the arm. he noted that he filed a police report following that incident, but that there had also been other incidents of physical violence as well. when asked if he felt safe in his mother’s care, [x] stated that he felt “definitely not safe with mum”. ... when asked what he did want, [x] stated, “i want to live with dad and unless it’s absolutely necessary i don’t want to see my mum”. following on from this statement the consultant asked if [x] could think of a scenario whereby it would be necessary to see his mother, however, he could not think of one. when asked if he would be willing to see her as part of the assessment process, he said no. when asked if there was anything his mother could do to help him be more open to reconnecting with her, [x] stated, “no because i know it would be fake”. [x] explained that he felt “betrayed” by his mother. he stated, “to be honest, i feel the only time she’s been nice to me is when she’s wanted something from me... i thought back to my time with her and she’s never been (he paused then went on to say) she’s either out of contact on her computer in her room, or only nice to me when she wants me to do schoolwork, then other times she’s savage and mean”. [x] was confident that if he ever changed his mind and did seek to reconnect with his mother, that his father would support him. he stated, “i think he (his father) just wants whatever is best for me, he goes by what i ask him to do”.[10]
i concede that it is possible that [x] is being manipulated adversely by his father or indeed is acting out his father’s previous coercive and controlling behaviour directed towards his mother. this is a risk which must be considered. however, in my view, a greater risk is that the child feels unheard and unsafe if directed to return into his mother’s care, regardless of whether such care is provided in the [suburb d] home. the court must proceed with extreme caution given the labile dynamic of the family.[11]
the current market value of the [suburb d] home is $580,000.00...based on [h bank] valuation and two appraisals.[14]
the history of the proceedings
to [ms b], [x] described being scared of his mother, whom he described as acting like a wild animal. by way of explanation, he complained that his mother had bitten him and, as a consequence, he needed to be home with dad. in this context, he described the last eight weeks of living solely with his father as being calm and stress free. accordingly, so far as [x]’s wishes and views, as recorded by [ms b] are concerned, it is to have nothing presently to do with his mother, whom he regards as being toxic. significantly, [x] did indicate to [ms b] that he still loves his mother. however, so far as [x]’s present views are concerned, he is strongly desirous of returning to the [suburb d] home, in which he is likely to feel safe, provided his mother is not there.[15]
the evidence
the parties
initial contributions
legal priniciples applicable
the contribution made by a party to the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the marriage and any children of the marriage, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent.[24]
in our opinion it is not so much a matter of erosion of contribution but a question of what weight is to be attached, in all the circumstances, to the initial contribution. it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution.
...there is no principle that the length of the marriage leads to a likelihood that other contributions will outweigh or weigh equally with ‘a particular contribution’. it is a matter of assessing the contributions of all relevant kinds in each case to arrive at an outcome, which is both appropriate and just and equitable. in some cases particular contributions may be outweighed or equalled by other ones. in other cases particular contributions may be so disproportionate to other contributions as to merit special recognition.[29]
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[33]
it is well established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties’ respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the post separation period to the point of assessment.
if there is no other way to do that which is just and equitable then a sale must take place. it becomes an incident of the sad fact that, when two persons separate, property which might have given them together a reasonable competence will not be sufficient for each when divided. that is an inescapable situation and cannot be used as an argument to deprive one party of that to which he or she is otherwise properly entitled.[37]
in summary, then, the trial judge has a discretion as to how superannuation interests will be treated in a particular case. if superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to: a) value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable. in the context of a consideration of the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of the last paragraph, the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse’s present and/or future entitlements under the fund.[39]
a) value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.
b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.
c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.
d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.
discussion
step one – the pool of property
...where the state of the evidence makes the process of valuation hazardous or uncertain, or where there are wide differences between legitimate valuations because of a volatile market or peculiarities relating to the specific property or otherwise, the ascertainment of value by judicial process may become too uncertain and the preferable course is to order the sale of the property so that its real value can be revealed by market forces.

step two – assessment of contributions
the task of evaluating and comparing the parties’ respective contributions where one party has exclusively been the breadwinner and the other exclusively the homemaker, is a most difficult one to perform because the evaluation and comparison cannot be conducted on a “level playing field”. firstly, it involves making a crucial comparison between fundamentally different activities, and a comparison between contributions to property and contributions to the welfare of the family. secondly, whilst a breadwinner contribution can be objectively assessed by reference to such things as that party’s employment record, income and the value of the assets acquired, an assessment of the quality of a homemaker contribution to the family is vulnerable to subjective value judgments as to what constitutes a competent homemaker and parent and cannot be readily equated to the value of assets acquired. this leads to a tendency to undervalue the homemaker role.[44]
the task of the court in proceedings under s 79 is not akin to an accounting exercise. the task is to examine the facts of each case carefully to decide what is appropriate and just and equitable in the circumstances. there cannot be expected to be a universal answer to that question on any given set of facts. it is of the essence of judicial discretion that different minds may comfortably arrive at different conclusions. by and large, marriage is a joint venture where parties can expect to buffer each other from the winds of misfortune that blow during the course of their relationship. the degree of the buffer may depend on how much individual sailing they do without consultation or indeed contrary to the wishes of the other. but there can be no certain answer to how much that should be when applying s.79 principles.
step three – the prospective needs of the parties
conclusions regardining property – justice and equity
given the evaluation of contribution based entitlements inevitably moves from qualitative evaluation of contributions to a quantitative reflection of such evaluation, there will inevitably be a “leap” from words to figures. that is the nature of the exercise of discretion, whether it be in the assessment of contributions in the matrimonial cause, assessment of damages in a personal injuries case, or determination of compensation in a land resumption case.[50]
