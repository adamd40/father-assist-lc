legislative context
review of a registrar’s decision
14.07 procedure for review   a court must hear an application for review of an exercise of power by a senior judicial registrar or judicial registrar as an original hearing.
note: in an original hearing, the court rehears the whole matter and does not simply review the decision of the original court. (2) the court may receive as evidence:   any affidavit or exhibit tendered in the first hearing, or (b) any further affidavit or exhibit, or (c) the transcript (if any) of the first hearing, or (d) if a transcript is not available – an affidavit about the evidence that was adduced at the first hearing, sworn by a person who was present at the first hearing. ...   if a transcript is not available – an affidavit about the evidence that was adduced at the first hearing, sworn by a person who was present at the first hearing.

note 1: these rules must be interpreted and applied, and any power conferred or duty imposed by them must be exercised or carried out, in the way that best promotes the overarching purpose (see subsection 67(3) of the federal circuit and family court act). note 2: see sections 190 and 191 of the federal circuit and family court act in relation to the overarching purpose of the rules of the federal circuit and family court (division 2). see also the federal circuit and family court of australia (division 2) (family law) rules 2021 which applies these rules with modifications.   parties to family law proceedings must conduct the proceeding (including negotiations for settlement of the dispute to which the proceeding relates) in a way that is consistent with the overarching purpose.
interim parenting
the real question was not one about the father’s tendency, but rather whether or not there was an unacceptable risk of harm to the children, which entails a forecast. it is not a fact capable of empirical proof. any evidence which is relevant to and influential in that predictive inquiry is admissible and should be taken into account (presuming it survives any other applicable rules of evidence), regardless of whether it meets the definition of and the threshold requirements for admissibility under the tendency rule.
