the legal principles  ] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) – something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act – the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent.  2] ...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests. [2]
125. the phrase “coerces or controls” is expressed disjunctively. however it may be seen that the two concepts are closely related. together they form an expanded concept of the exercise of power, to restrain another or to cause another to act, by force, domination or command...
generally, coercive control is understood as a course of conduct aimed at dominating and controlling another person, including a family member.
the assessment of whether conduct that falls within one of the provided examples constitutes family violence as defined in s 4ab(1) of the act necessarily requires that conduct to be considered in the context in which it occurred.  ] ...to the extent that it is submitted that the mother’s allegations of “horrific domestic violence” could only be accepted if objectively corroborated, we do not find that any such requirement exists. where domestic violence occurs in a family it frequently occurs in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage, and possibly their children. we cannot accept that a court could never make a positive finding that such violence occurred without there being corroborative evidence from a third party or a document or an admission. we have not been referred to any authority in support of such a proposition. ... [81] the victims of domestic violence do not have to complain to the authorities or subject themselves to medical examinations, which may provide corroborative evidence of some fact, to have their evidence of assault accepted. clearly if they do so it is evidence which may assist the court in determining an allegation.
the child
factual findings including as to family violence
they [the police] said you can’t leave a single detail out of it.... the police asked me very specific question like even what hand he slapped me with, and everything.... i told the whole story to my lawyer.  e father] reports whilst they were dating, [the mother] requested he make a video of the two of them having sex. [the mother] set up the camera. [the father] reports if i show you the video you will see it is her setting up the camera and asked could he show the manager. manager refused to look at the video and told [the father] that if he needs to show anyone he needs to show his lawyer. [the father] stated that he just wanted the manager to know the truth.[17]
next time if you tell anyone about my affairs then i’ll also tell them about your abortion.[18]
the video i’ll make will be a bit more intense now.[19]
don’t try be oversmart [sic] with me because u don’t know me yet and u will never know me[20]
male speaker: [not clear] what is acceptable for you and what is not. female speaker: acceptable to me, you are not acceptable at all to me. male speaker: alright. it is not a problem. you are not acceptable to me with him. alright. and i know that i will not get him and neither will you. that is why i have made proper arrangements for him. if you get ten guards, i will get fifty guards. whether you go to [country g] or anywhere else in the world. alright. remember my words. regardless of what you have thought of me, i am a big deal. female speaker: not [country c], this is not [country c]. there is nothing you can do to him. male speaker: alright? female speaker: you can’t even touch him with a finger. male speaker: i can do it to him now. it is locked for four years/there is imprisonment for four years. don’t make me mad. female speaker: where will your conscience go after that? after hitting/killing your own child. male speaker: i will have the satisfaction that you have not satisfaction. what do you think... [23]
female speaker: then, it is fine. let us wrap up, [mr hassen]. that is it, you get out of my life. i get out of your life. male speaker: i will not even let you live with such an ease. ok. if you think that you will take him (pointing to the child) as you did it before. now, i will first take him, then i will come back. then, you may come up with the terms, whatever these may be. what is acceptable you and what is not acceptable to you? female speaker: acceptable! you are not acceptable to me at all. male speaker: okay. it does not matter. you are also not acceptable to me with him (pointing towards the child). is it okay? and i know that neither i nor you will get him. so, i have made some firm arrangements for this. if you hire 10 guards, i will hire 50 guards. you may go to [country g] or anywhere in the world. okay. remember my point. you have underestimated me, i am a big gun. you may not take undue advantage of my nobleness. female speaker: nobility! male speaker: exactly, do not take advantage of it. ... female speaker: then, it is okay. you will not get [x]. this is australia. male speaker: why will i not get him? female speaker: this is not [country c], [mr hassen]! this is not [country c]... you cannot do anything to him. male speaker: is it so? female speaker: you cannot even touch him with your finger. male speaker: i can do it to him now. the punishment is imprisonment for four years. okay. do not make me a fool. (mother’s last translated sentence is “don’t make me mad”). female speaker: afterwards, what will you do with your conscience? male speaker: conscience? female speaker: after hitting your child? (mother’s translated sentence is “after hitting/killing your own child). male speaker: i will get the satisfaction that you will not remain peace. (the mother’s translated sentence is “i will have the satisfaction that you have not satisfaction.) you take yourself as...[24]
in [early] 2019, [mr hassen] and i were in our bedroom and [x] was lying on our bed, when [mr hassen] and i began to argue about his affair. i would describe our bedroom as a normal room containing one double bed. on the opposite side of the bedroom door is a glass window. during the argument, [mr hassen] and i were standing facing each other at the end of the bed. suddenly [mr hassen] grabbed me by my head and pushed me towards the window and bounced my head off the window. i was frightened but the glass did not break, nor did i have any injuries. he moved his hands to my neck and began to squeeze. i don't remember how long he squeezed my neck for, but it felt uncomfortable. it wasn't long enough for me to stop breathing. as [mr hassen] had hold of my neck, [mr hassen]'s mother entered the room and told him to stop and said, "enough is enough". [mr hassen] said that its ok and we were just talking.[29]
i think it’s the same. he did it against the window and the mirror...... it’s the same. the window and the mirror – whatever you call it. i told them specifically.
later that month, i was lying on the ground on top of some pillows watching a video on my phone at the end of my bed. [mr hassen] entered the room and told me that i was a liar and began to swear at me. he was angry at me because i had told him that i was going to find a new place and move out. as i laid on the ground, [mr hassen] raised his leg and kicked me. he struck me so hard that it caused me to roll over towards the wall. i was in immense pain and sat up crying in agony. [x] was in the room with me and witnessed [mr hassen] kick me. [x] then kicked me and walked out with father.[34]
i’ve made up my mind to treat you well and said sorry now you will fuk [sic] my mind again if you go stop playing with [x]’s life.[35]   early] 2019, i was sleeping on the sofa of our lounge room. [mr hassen] sat down and started a conversation with me. he asked me why i was moving out and told me that he had left [ms e]. he then told me that he wanted to have sex with me. i told him no and asked him to leave me alone otherwise i would call the police. at this time [mr hassen] was standing over the top of me when he leant in and attempted to cuddle me. i pushed him away using my hands and told him it was too late in the night. he placed his hands on the left-hand side of my [body and] scratched his hands across my [body]. i felt an instant sharp pain in this area...it left two red marks.[37]
i m telling you again and again don’t go try to forget the past and live normally [x] needs both mother and father together if u go u will fuck my mind again
u r a very selfish person that doesn’t care about your son disgusting mom u r.[39]
have some manners bitch u don’t let me see my son u r a fucking bitch. [41]
father: we are done, i want to go and work, come and pick up [x] from the station. or else tell me your address and i will drop him. mother: no i won’t tell you my address. father: if you don’t pick him up, i’ll just drop him off anywhere i like. you are not going to talk badly about me or my family. [x] is with me, i’m going to do something to [x].
counsel: in paragraph 40 of your affidavit, you say he says i’m going to do something to [x] and you say to the court now he said i’m going to harm the baby. mother: i can understand what he was telling me in my language, but when it is translated there is some difference. he was telling me on the phone and when i was living with him – i’m going to harm him, i’m going to do something with him so i was telling this. counsel: so you’re saying it’s a translation problem. mother: i speak what i know. counsel: the words im going to harm the baby are a translation issue. mother: yes. counsel: that conversation didn’t take place. he didn’t say i’m going to harm the baby or i’m going to do something to [x]. mother: no that is incorrect, it happened.  he probative value of a particular piece of evidence should not be considered in isolation from the rest of the evidence, including the proposed evidence. this is particularly so where the court is asked to draw an inference from all of the evidence, that is to say, all of the circumstances of the matter. this is because one piece of evidence may affect the probative value of another and a number of pieces of evidence when considered together may have a probative value greater than if each is considered individually.
counsel: you stayed in that house with [mr hassen] and you then, gave him right throughout 2019 up until he left australia and 2020, unsupervised time, overnight. mother: yes, because he threatens to kill the baby whenever i say something to him. that’s what he used to do. he used to use it against me like, whenever i would say something to his family [he would say] oh i’m going to do something to [x], or if you don’t give me the passport i would do something to him. that was his usual sentence he used to use. counsel: he never used those words. mother: he did. counsel: if he has used those words you would gone to the police because you would have been very concerned about your child being killed by [mr hassen]. mother: i should have done that. counsel: you didn’t do that because it didn’t happen, and you were never, and you still are not, concerned about the safety of your child whilst in his care. mother: i am concerned. he’s the one that used that word again and again.
whilst i had some reservations about allowing [x] to spend time with [mr hassen], i was concerned about causing further trauma to [x] by not allowing him to see [mr hassen]. i was also fearful that [mr hassen] would physically or mentally harm me if i did not allow [mr hassen] to spend some time with [x]. i was also concerned that [mr hassen] would spread rumours about me in the local [country c] community in sydney.[43]
i should have valued you and give you the honour and respect u [sic] deserve... i lost my temper and personality.[45]
i don’t want you to use bad things i’ve said when i was angry against me in court... and then i’ll have to live with that for my entire life.[46]
mother: when can i come and pick [x] up? father: no, i’m not going to give you [x] back. you’re having an affair. you have another guy in your life and you’re not taking care of my son. i’m going to take him to a psychologist. my baby is not safe with you.[54]
in light of the stress, confusion and conflict as to parenting arrangements between [ms mawad] i, her recent false complaint to the police, the unnecessary uncertainty about the man in the car and her erratic behaviour in speeding away, [in mid]-2019, i took [x] with me to [country c]. i did so hoping to improve the relationship between [ms mawad] and myself and parenting arrangements for [x], my objective being to obtain the help and support of both [ms mawad]’s family and my family. i did this without consulting [ms mawad]. i took the view in doing so at the time that removing myself and [x] from the conflict for a short period of time and going to [country c] where both respected families resided, would calm the situation and provide a better outcome for [x] in that [ms mawad] and i would resolve our parenting arrangements which were in his best interest. i acknowledge that i did not consult [ms mawad], which i now regret, however, at the time did it for the purpose of trying to improve our co-parenting relationship in the interests of our child.[55]
mother: what do you think, if i get custody of [x], will [mr hassen] [harm] him? sister-in-law: yes i think he can [harm] him. he said so in front of our father and me.[57]
mother: can i talk to [x]? sister-in-law: no i can’t let you because [mr hassen] told me not to let you talk to [x]. [mr hassen] does now know we are talking to you. he told me that if anyone helps you in any way, [mr hassen] is going to take [x] away. [mr hassen] is asking [x] every day who he talks to just to make sure.[58]
counsel: [ms murphy] has said you followed the father’s direction without question because you thought at that time, that was love. mother: yes. counsel: i take it at some point you realised following directions without question was not love? mother: yes. counsel: was there a particular event that made you think this way? mother: after every incident he would say, whatever i tell you, i love you. so i used to think that yeah, when he would shout at me and yell at me in front of his sisters he would say i’m doing it for your own good and whatever i do i still love you. so i used to say that he loves me a lot. but his sisters would say that if a person loves you, he first needs to respect you. if he doesn’t respect you, he doesn’t love you. and i used to say no, no he loves me but sometimes he doesn’t respect me and that’s okay. but later on when he started hitting me and doing things with me, and he would call me bad names. and i realised he used to tell me he loves me and that he couldn’t live without me if i left and now he’s calling me a prostitute and not a good girl? so then i realised, it was not love. and it was all one sided.
really impacted by [the father’s] presence and interactions with me, which were often critical and abusive towards me.[63]
...he likes to message me time and again and i don’t want to reply to his messages. when he came back again he started video calling when my son was with me and my son would video chat with him. it was the same as back then. the same controlling behaviour. the same “oh you are not a good mother” and “oh [ms e] is a very good mother” all the stuff started again and i thought these messages were all the same thing. i tried to reply to him as less as i can because it was not good for my mental health. when he put forward that message i discussed it with my son. i sat him down and said did something like that happen and he said no, you are the only one who is kissing me on the lips and i thought that as well. but suddenly i got a call from the police that he has filed a sexual harassment case against my husband and the investigation started.
taking anti-depression and has already told the father that she is not mentally fit to take care of the child.
i went there before that as well and after that i went to [suburb o] police station after receiving the notice of risk not particularly because of that. he was video calling, and messages and phone calls and he was doing the same thing he used to do and so i went to the police station for that and they told that me he’s not physically harming you only mentally disturbing you so stop taking his calls and put his number on a block list.
counsel: you, as a father, would not put [x] in a position where you believe he would be harmed. father: yes, that’s correct. counsel: and as you sit here today, you still hold the belief that he has been sexually abused by [mr d]. father: that’s what he told me yes. counsel: so surely you wouldn't let him go back to the same household where his alleged abuser lives? father: if the court made an order i would let him go, obviously. i would follow court orders. counsel: and surely you wouldn't put [x] in a position where he is neglected as you have claimed, by his mother? father: yes. i can do only my part. so when he is with me, i’ll take care of him. i don't have control over what she does. counsel: my concerns is this. even if the orders you seek are made, if what you say is true about still having these concerns about sexual abuse and neglect, it seems to me that you have no genuine intention to effect orders that her honour makes. father: i respect the court and its orders. i have not seen him for so many years unsupervised.
the family report
the additional considerations
counsel: you have no concerns for his safety. [mr d]: of course i do. counsel: the fact is, if the father gets time with the child, then it’s your view that you and the mother should have no time with the child. [mr d]: yep. counsel: in you taking that position, you have no concerns about the safety of [x] in the care of [mr hassen]. [mr d]: i have concerns. counsel: well, you wouldn’t say to the reporter that he live full time with the father. [mr d]: because there is no actual harm if [x] is living in one home. because if he will become a football like from one house to another, he will be apart from those issues between two families then the safety of [x] is concerned. then he will be used to manipulate the other party. but if he will be staying at one house, which is preferable, like live with his mother, then there is no safety concern. i believe that if he lives at one place. the best thing would be if he lives with the mother. the second best would be for him to live at least one place.
counsel: clearly, this [[mr d]’s position] indicates that [mr d] did not consider the father physically harmed or would physically harm the child. court child expert: i can’t answer what [mr d] was thinking but that’s not how i took it at the time. i believed it was a desperation in terms of the behaviour they were seeing from [x] when he was, in their allegation, manipulated by the father or the mother and [mr d] were denigrated by the father. i took it that he was not wanting [x] to be put in the middle and that was the desperate solution.
determination
parental responsibility
x’s live with and time with arrangements
for [x] a relationship such as this relationship is likely to impact his self-esteem, how he views himself, his confidence and his relationships in the future. [mr hassen] would be able to assist [x] during his development by providing open and loving interactions and allowing [x] to discuss what is occurring in his life, including what occurs in [mr hassen]’s household.[91]
in a situation where coercive and controlling family violence is happening, the perpetrator utilises a variety of tactics including psychological abuse, restriction of movement and contacts, and incidents of actual harm to cause a victim to feel fear and intimidation, which leads to submission or compliance by the victim and, on some occasions, the victim can respond with violence.[92]
exposure to family violence, including witnessing and/or hearing incidents of family violence or being cared for by a victim-parent whose parenting is impaired as a consequence of the perpetrator’s choices and actions, is known to have a detrimental impact on children. exposure to family violence can be experienced as traumatic by children, irrespective of the age at which the exposure occurs, which can contribute to a range of psychosocial and relational difficulties, including an increased risk of emotional and behavioural disturbance for a child or a child engaging in interpersonal relationships that feature family violence.
...suffer insecurity, fear, unhappiness, anxiety and hypervigilance from witnessing abusive behaviour of a parent. such effects present a threat to their emotional development. probably the worst danger to children is the role model that a violent parent provides which can lead to children themselves coming to suffer the serious social disability of using violence in their dealings with other people including those they love. such a disability can destroy the most intimate relationships and bring the person into conflict with other people, the police and the law...
there is concern, if it has veracity, about the potential lethality of [mr hassen] choking [ms mawad].[93]
her honour: the mother gives evidence of an incident in [early] 2019 whereby she asserts that the father kicked her in [x]’s presence and subsequent to that [x] who had observed that assault take place walked over to the mother and effectively mimicked the father’s actions in attempting to kick her as well. if i find that incident occurred, both the assault by the father and the mimicking behaviour by [x], is there any comment you would like to make, or anything you can opine about that alleged incident? court child expert: it is very common for children to copy behaviour of their parents or what they have seen, and it may be a child trying to maintain the relationship or do what one parent wants because they are trying to make that parent happy. witnessing violence is very detrimental on a child’s wellbeing. it affects their brain development, it puts them in a space of fear and that negatively affects their development because a child fundamentally needs to feel safe to develop appropriately. it impacts the risk of having a mental health disorder so depression or anxiety are more common, they can have physical complaints, their sleep and relationships with others. so being witness to that is very detrimental to a child’s wellbeing.
in this instance, [x]’s well-being is likely to be negatively affected. it could increase the chance of him experiencing depression and anxiety, it could increase his emotional distress, and negatively affect his self-esteem and his social relationships. it would also likely negatively affect [ms mawad]’s parenting ability due to her increase in distress and this in turn would negatively affect [x].[94]
...this is unlikely to result in meaningful change if [mr hassen] maintains his position that he has not acted in this fashion and hence takes no responsibility for his behaviour. in this circumstance, [x] spending time with [mr hassen] should not be contingent on [mr hassen]’s engagement with such a program, but rather with his ongoing demonstration of significant behaviour change including taking responsibility for his past behaviour choices.[95]
it can engender low self-esteem and self-hatred in the child, with them thinking that there is something wrong with them that their parent does not love and care for them. it can also cause a child to have difficulty trusting others and increase the chance that they will experience anxiety and depression.[97]
if [mr hassen] was a good person, we would be more than happy for [x] to spend time with his father on a regular basis, however [mr hassen]'s behaviour to date has not shown this. [mr hassen]'s manipulative behaviour will affect [ms mawad] and [x]s mental health and [mr hassen] continued manipulation through [x] before september 2020 created a lot of distress for [ms mawad] and in our family life....... i am concerned about future allegations that [mr hassen] might make about my relationship with [x], as i believe that [mr hassen] will not stop until he gets what he wants and that i will have to continue to prove myself time and time again to people like child protection and the police.[98]
her honour: paragraph 81 of your report suggests to me that for you, a serious consideration was the high conflict between these two parties and how [x]’s continued exposure will have negative effects upon him. is it your opinion that those negative effects of that high conflict relationship, if i’m to find that, could not be sufficiently ameliorated by supervised time continuing? court child expert: no, the experiences that were told to me and the examples of the behaviour including [x] being taken on an overseas and not being able to communicate with the other parent. there seemed to be a number of examples of the inability of the parents to coparent effectively. [ms mawad] was driven by fear due to her report and that will impact [x]’s wellbeing going forward.
