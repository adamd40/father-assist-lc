background
the legislative pathway and interim hearings
meaningful relationship 0] ... apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.

the colouring book
supervised time to date   walsworth] asked [x] if she would like a bath. [x] did not respond. i observed [mr walsworth] to mention it again. [mr walsworth] said the girls could have a bath if they wanted to or if they did not want one now, they could have one later. i observed [x] to say, “i’m not having a bath.” i observed [x] to be firm in her response and short with her response. i observed [mr walsworth] to continue to tidy up.[12]
the additional considerations
it is unclear to the author what other factors may have contributed to [x]’s poor view of [mr walsworth]. however, it is possible that she may hold some feelings of guilt about her desire to live with her father, she may feel conflicted between the two parties, or it could raise questions about her relationship with [mr walsworth] or the nature of [mr walsworth]’s caregiving.[17]
