relevant law
the expression “just and equitable” is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[12]
third[ly] whether making a property settlement order is “just and equitable” is not to be answered by beginning from the assumption that one or other party has the right to have the property of the parties divided between them or has the right to an interest in marital property which is fixed by reference to various matters (including financial and other contributions) set out in s 79(4). the power to make a property settlement order must be exercised “in accordance with legal principles, including the principles which the act itself lays down”. to conclude that making an order is “just and equitable” only because of and by reference to various matters in s 79(4), without a separate consideration of s 79(2), would be to conflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles laid down by the act.[14] (citations omitted) (emphasis added).
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as need or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[15]
the third “fundamental proposition” demands separate consideration of the preliminary question of whether it is just and equitable to make any order altering property interests before the need arises to consider the extent to which existing interests are to be altered and the manner in which that is to be done. ... just as the expression “just and equitable” does not admit of exhaustive definition, it is not possible to catalogue the “range of potentially competing considerations” that may be taken into account in determining whether it is just and equitable to make an order altering property interests. however, in our view, it would be a fundamental misunderstanding to read stanford as suggesting that the matters referred to in s 79(4) should be ignored in coming to that decision. indeed, such a reading would ignore the plain words of s 79(4), which make clear that in considering “what order (if any)” to make, the court must take into account the matters referred to in that subsection (emphasis added). this requirement to consider the s 79(4) matters in determining whether it is just and equitable to make any order provides fertile ground for potential conflation of the two different issues, which the high court has warned against. however, this potential will not be realised in many cases because of what the plurality said at [42] about the “just and equitable” requirement being “readily satisfied”. but there will be a range of cases, of which arguably the present is a good example, where determining whether it is just and equitable to make any order altering property interests will not be so clear cut and will therefore require not only separate but very careful deliberation. we do not consider it helpful, and indeed it is misleading, to describe this separate enquiry as a “threshold” issue. we say this for two reasons. first, as was emphasised in stanford, the initial enquiry is to determine the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties. secondly, although s 79(2) is cast in the negative and amounts to a prohibition against making any order unless it is just and equitable to do so, the corollary is that if the court does make an order, such order itself must be just and equitable. the just and equitable requirement is therefore not a threshold issue, but rather one permeating the entire process. it will be seen from this discussion that while the s 79(2) and s 79(4) issues must not be conflated, they are intertwined because the text of the act links them. this was recognised in ferguson & ferguson where strauss j said that s 79(2) “is directed to both the questions whether an order should be made at all, and what the order should be, if one is made”. ... in our view, it will be less likely that the separate issues arising under s 79(2) and s 79(4) will be conflated if judges refrain from evaluating contributions and other relevant factors in percentage or monetary terms until they have first determined that it would be just and equitable to make an order...[17] (citations omitted)
in adopting the approach she did, her honour proceeded in accordance with what the full court said in both bevan and chapman, namely that it is open to a trial judge to take into account the matters stated in s 79(4) (or s 90sm) of the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”) when determining whether it is “just and equitable” to adjust existing property interests. however, consistent with stanford, her honour also recognised that it was not open to her to decide that issue merely by reference to those matters.[18]
legal and equitable interests of the parties
re: [z street, town h], vic thank you for the opportunity to provide you with an opinion of the property’s current market worth. to establish the market worth of a property, we take into account comparable properties which have recently sold, also those that are currently for sale. based on the information available, i believe the current market worth of the property is between $210,000 and $230,000
is it just and equitable to make orders adjusting the parties’ property interests?
“[i]t may be that the ability of a court to take into account the terms of an unapproved agreement creates in the words of hoffman lj “the worst of both worlds” as it would be impossible to predict from case to case, exactly what weight ought to be given to the agreement...however it is the dominant and unwavering thread of all cases that the parties cannot by their conduct or agreement oust the jurisdiction of the court”.[22]
“where parties enter into an agreement concerning property...the court must determine the application on its merits having regard to the factors set out in s 79(4) as they exist at the time of the hearing. there is no threshold test, before embarking upon the s 79 exercise, to determine whether the earlier agreement was just and equitable at the time it was made according to the facts as they then existed and the law then in force. the earlier agreement should be considered (as an indication of what the parties may have regarded as just and equitable at the time), but its provisions only given effect if they coincide with an order which is just and equitable according to s 79 at the time of the hearing”.[24]
