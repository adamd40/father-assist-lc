the mother’s position: not a parenting plan
the father’s position: section 10j does not apply

note: paragraph (f)--if the child support (assessment) act 1989 applies, provisions in a parenting plan dealing with the maintenance of a child (as distinct from child support under that act) are unenforceable and of no effect unless the provisions in the plan are a child support agreement (see section 63caa and subsection 63g(5) of this act). (2a) the person referred to in subsection (2) may be, or the persons referred to in that subsection may include, either a parent of the child or a person other than the parent of the child (including a grandparent or other relative of the child). (2b) without limiting paragraph (2)(c), the plan may deal with the allocation of responsibility for making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child. (2c) the communication referred to in paragraph (2)(e) includes (but is not limited to) communication by:   letter, and (b) telephone, email or any other electronic means.   an agreement may be a parenting plan: (a) whether made before or after the commencement of this section, and (b) whether made inside or outside australia, and (c) whether other persons as well as a child's parents are also parties, and (d) whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2). note: one of the other matters with which a parenting plan may deal is child support (see section 63caa).   whether made before or after the commencement of this section, and (b) whether made inside or outside australia, and (c) whether other persons as well as a child's parents are also parties, and (d) whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2).   whether made inside or outside australia, and (c) whether other persons as well as a child's parents are also parties, and (d) whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2).   whether other persons as well as a child's parents are also parties, and (d) whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2).   whether it deals with other matters as well as matters mentioned in subsection (2).   provisions of a parenting plan that deal with matters other than the maintenance of a child are child welfare provisions . (5) provisions of a parenting plan that deal with the matter mentioned in paragraph (2)(f) are child maintenance provisions .   provisions of a parenting plan that deal with the matter mentioned in paragraph (2)(f) are child maintenance provisions .   a registered parenting plan is a parenting plan: (a) that was registered in a court under section 63e as in force at any time before the commencement of the family law amendment act 2003 , and (b) that continued to be registered immediately before the commencement of the family law amendment act 2003 .   that was registered in a court under section 63e as in force at any time before the commencement of the family law amendment act 2003 , and (b) that continued to be registered immediately before the commencement of the family law amendment act 2003 .   that continued to be registered immediately before the commencement of the family law amendment act 2003 .  ] the parties attended a family dispute resolution mediation on 8 november 2017 at the s family relationship centre. a document was prepared as a result of that mediation and entitled “parenting agreement”, a copy of which is annexure ‘a’ to the father’s affidavit. however, the document never became a parenting agreement within the meaning of that term in the act as it was not signed by either party.[2] as the document is not a parenting agreement and is patently the product of family dispute resolution between the parties, having been conducted by persons described on the document as “family dispute resolution practitioners”, i cannot take notice of anything in that document past the title page as they are not admissible in evidence. [emphasis added]   what is sought to be provided in evidence in this case is not something said or an admission made in the dispute resolution process, but the terms of an agreement that has been reached at the end of that process. [9] it seems to me that it cannot properly be said that a parenting plan agreement reached at the end of such a process could be said to be within the confines of s.10j. the section refers to things said during that process, not the contents of an agreement reached between the parties. on a broader level, such a reading of s10j would make the dispute resolution process a redundant one if an agreement reached between the parties, embodied in a parenting plan, were not able to be relied upon later in court. [10] this is particularly the case here, given that under the scheme of the act, parenting plans are available to parties as a less formal method of reaching an agreement about parenting arrangements and then obtaining court orders. in this sense, parenting plans are a form of agreement contemplated by the act, just as a contract might be entered into by way of settlement of a commercial or civil matter. parenting plans, though not a common law contract, gain force as the result of the various provisions of the act. however, for the purpose of placing them in the context of without prejudice negotiations or negotiations in family dispute resolution, they fulfil a similar purpose to a settlement contract of accord and satisfaction. [11] it was also argued that because the parenting plan in this case is said not to cover the entirety of the parenting issues between the parties, it could not be said to be a parenting plan within the meaning of the act, or at least it would still be covered by s.10j. [12] i reject this proposition entirely. it is not at all uncommon for parties to settle part of a parenting dispute and not be able to settle other parts. the fact that they had settled part of a dispute, and embodied that in a parenting plan, does not mean that the plan dealing with at least part of the issues is no longer a parenting plan within the meaning of the act, nor should it be covered by the provisions of s.10j. section 63c(1)(c) clearly contemplates that only one of the matters in s.63c(2) may be covered by the plan. section 63c(2)(i) specifically refers to: (i) any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child. [13] i therefore find that a parenting plan entered into during the course of, or at the end of, a family dispute resolution is prima facie admissible into evidence in the proceedings for the purpose of having regard for it under s.65dab. [14] i turn then to consider whether or not the document in this case is a parenting plan within the meaning of s.63c. in this case, it is agreed that the parenting plan complies with all of the formal requirements set out in s.63c(1) which is in the following terms: 63c [meaning of parenting plan and related terms] (1) a parenting plan is an agreement that: (a) is in writing, and (b) is or was made between the parents of a child, and (ba) is signed by the parents of the child, and (bb) is dated, and (c) deals with a matter or matters mentioned in subsection (2). [15] as this was agreed between the parties, it was not necessary for me to inspect the document, and that is why it remains sealed in an envelope pending the determination of its admissibility, and so as to ensure that i would not be aware of its actual contents, if it was not ultimately admissible in the proceedings. [16] the issue that arose was whether or not the parenting plan was an agreement that was free from any threat, duress or coercion as required by s.63c(1a). that section reads as follows: 63c [meaning of parenting plan and related terms] ... (1a) an agreement is not a parenting plan for the purposes of this act unless it is made free from any threat, duress or coercion. [17] the father in this case says that at the time that he executed the document, he was exhausted after a lengthy period of family dispute resolution, some four hours, it being the second session within two days, the first being the day before for some three hours. he says that at the time, he had a migraine and that he felt threatened and under great duress as a result of what had been said by the person conducting the family dispute resolution in a private session with the dispute resolution provider. [18] as a result of s.10j, it was not open to the father to lead any evidence as to what was actually said to him or the context of the precise statement because of the way in which the section operates. he was therefore limited to the bare statement that he felt threatened and under great duress. [emphasis added]  ] as a result of s.10j, it was not open to the father to lead any evidence as to what was actually said to him or the context of the precise statement because of the way in which the section operates. he was therefore limited to the bare statement that he felt threatened and under great duress.  ] section 131 of the evidence act 1994 also excludes and renders inadmissible, (subject to a number of exceptions as enumerated in that section), evidence of negotiations between parties. [22] on the basis of either s.10j of the act or s.131 of the evidence act, the document that has been prepared could not be admissible in any court for any purpose. the document clearly seeks to set out an agreement that was apparently negotiated between parents with the assistance of, and in the company of, a family dispute resolution practitioner, and accordingly must, by necessity, contain and be a record of evidence of anything said in the company of a family dispute resolution practitioner. [23] on that basis, and as i have indicated, i have not considered or had any reference to the document and, indeed, it will be struck out as part of the evidence presently before the court as it should not be here. that is not intended as some castigation or overt criticism of the legal practitioners for the parties but simply a reflection of the mandatory nature of the exclusion of that evidence, specifically under section 10j, but also by reference to s. 131 of the evidence act.
privilege provided by the family law act [17] it is convenient to commence with a consideration of the specific provisions of the family law act. part ii deals with non-court based family services. division 1 provides for a number of accreditation rules which can be provided for in the regulations. the regulations do contain those rules in regulations 57 to 61. there is nothing before me, in this case, to show that mr m is registered, and neither party alleges that mr m was so registered. [18] the confidentiality provisions contained within ss.10d and 10e, 10f or 10j do not appear to apply unless mr m were a family counsellor or family dispute resolution practitioner, as defined in ss.10c or 10g of the act. in the circumstances, i am not persuaded that the provisions of the act provide any basis to oppose the production of the material subpoenaed. [19] i accept the submission from counsel for the wife that, even if the provisions of the act did apply, s.10d provides the basis for mr m to make a disclosure for the purposes of protecting a child from the risk of harm, or preventing or lessening a serious and imminent threat to the life of health of a person (there being an identical provision in section 10h with respect to family dispute resolution) which would found the disclosure to the doctor. [20] whether this would ultimately provide part of a foundation for the inadmissibility of the evidence of mr m under part ii of the family law act (in light of ss.10e and 10j respectively), it is not a matter that i would need to determine at this point. as a result of mr m not being a counsellor covered by part ii, i conclude that the family law act provisions in part ii do not provide a basis for upholding the objections to the subpoena. section 131 of the evidence act [21] section 131 of the evidence act excludes evidence of settlement negotiations save in specified circumstances set out in s.131(2). ... ... [23] it is well accepted that there does not need to be proceedings pending before the privilege provided for in s.131 is available. ... [26] in the circumstances, s.131 of the commonwealth evidence act appears to cover the field with respect to without-prejudice privilege and marriage counselling, replacing the common law privileges. for this reason, the arguments based upon the common law privilege are not available and the circumstances must be considered within the ambit of s.131. [27] i note that dealing with such an application entirely within the ambit of s.131 is consistent with the reasoning adopted by dessau j in wilson & roberts (no.2) [2010] famca 734, [23–37]. i also note that the decision approves the proposition that s.69zt(1) of the family law act does not oust the operation of s.131 of the evidence act, as s.131 does not fall within the various parts of the evidence act dealt with by s.69zt. [28] as a result, i find that s.131(1) appears to apply to prohibit the adducing of this evidence, unless it falls within an exception in s.131(2). [29] the relevant exceptions, for the purpose of this case, are ss.131(2)(c) and (g), which provide as follows: (2) subsection (1) does not apply if ... (c) the substance of the evidence has been partly disclosed with the express or implied consent of the persons in dispute, and full disclosure of the evidence is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the other evidence that has already been adduced, or ... (g) evidence that has been adduced in the proceeding, or an inference from evidence that has been adduced in the proceeding, is likely to mislead the court unless evidence of the communication or document is adduced to contradict or to qualify that evidence[.] ... [33] the letter from the counsellor sets out four matters that need to be considered: (a) the presentation of the husband on 24 february 2010, (b) interactions with respect to the follow-on appointment, (c) the husband’s presentation in the session on 3 march 2010, and (d) the overall presentation of the husband leading mr m to state that he believes the husband is a suicide risk and in need of urgent psychiatric assessment and perhaps hospitalisation. [34] in field & commissioner for railways (nsw) [1957] hca 92, (1957) 99 clr 285, 32 aljr 110, the high court identified the purpose of the privilege was to enable litigants to engage with one another freely and without the embarrassment which the liability of the communications being put in evidence might impose upon them. the litigants are relieved of this embarrassment so that their negotiations to avoid litigation or to settle may go unhampered (at page 291). importantly, the court went on to state: this form of privilege, however, is directed against the admission in evidence of express or implied admissions. it covers admissions by words or conduct. for example, neither party can use the readiness of the other to negotiate as an implied admission. it is not concerned with objective facts which may be ascertained during the course of negotiations. these may be proved by direct evidence. but it is concerned with the use of the negotiations, or what is said in the course of them, as evidence by way of admission. ... [emphasis added]   the presentation of the husband on 24 february 2010, (b) interactions with respect to the follow-on appointment, (c) the husband’s presentation in the session on 3 march 2010, and (d) the overall presentation of the husband leading mr m to state that he believes the husband is a suicide risk and in need of urgent psychiatric assessment and perhaps hospitalisation.   interactions with respect to the follow-on appointment, (c) the husband’s presentation in the session on 3 march 2010, and (d) the overall presentation of the husband leading mr m to state that he believes the husband is a suicide risk and in need of urgent psychiatric assessment and perhaps hospitalisation.   the husband’s presentation in the session on 3 march 2010, and (d) the overall presentation of the husband leading mr m to state that he believes the husband is a suicide risk and in need of urgent psychiatric assessment and perhaps hospitalisation.   the overall presentation of the husband leading mr m to state that he believes the husband is a suicide risk and in need of urgent psychiatric assessment and perhaps hospitalisation.
section 131 exclusion of evidence of settlement negotiations   evidence is not to be adduced of: (a) a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute, or (b) a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute.   a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate
