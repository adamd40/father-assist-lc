introduction
and collectively (“the aunt and uncle”).
and collectively (“the parents”).
background
...it took me years to think about it when [ms glass][sic] asked for [f] i knew [mr glass] won’t agree and than [sic] when me and [mr glass] started to talk about having no more kids i just think of [ms glass][sic] how she wanted to have kids but she can’t and here i am talking about having no kids not because that we can’t but because we’re lazy...
the competing proposals
the evidence
the legislative pathway
“there is a clear need in each case to understand the ramifications of applying the factor of parenthood. the factor may have little weight if the child has had no relationship whatsoever with the parent. it may be of little significance where the parent poses a real risk to the child's welfare. it may also not be a decisive factor in cases where other factors overwhelmingly outweigh it, but it may be very significant in a dispute between a capable parent and a more capable grandparent, and determinative in a dispute between a capable parent and an outstanding neighbour, foster parent, sibling or other person with a proper interest in caring for the child.”  0] ... apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
discussion and determination
...under that unrelenting pressure we are instructed by our client that she eventually relented and agreed to fall pregnant with a fourth child, that was to be adopted by [ms telito] and [mr telito].”[21]
...quite clingy to me and follows me everywhere in the house. he seems worried for me to be out of his sight. the other children understand this and are kind to him about it but it upsets me to see how upset he gets when i walk to another part of our house or use the toilet.[25]
