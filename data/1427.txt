unacceptable risk  that the father presents an unacceptable risk to the emotional and psychological welfare of x, and (2) that there is no evidence that the risk can be reasonably mitigated.   that there is no evidence that the risk can be reasonably mitigated.   previously ordered supervised time was attempted by the parties but was largely not successful. mr machak gave evidence that he either sacked or made b contact service withdraw because they forced him and the paternal grandmother to speak english during supervised time, and they were “on-side” with the mother. ms lewy gave evidence that mr machak harassed and stalked the supervisors from b contact service, which caused the withdrawal, (b) the father cannot meet the costs of a private supervisor, nor can he meet the costs of ongoing hair follicle testing, (c) the mother has expressed that she does not feel x is protected from harm if only the paternal grandmother acts as a supervisor, as the paternal grandmother is also fearful of mr machak. dr c’s report notes that mr machak’s familial past resulted in him doing as he pleases and there must be serious doubt about whether his mother, an ageing woman, could effectively supervise time. i note also there is no evidence from the paternal grandmother to reassure the court about her capacity or willingness to supervise contact between x and her son, (d) if the court were to order supervised time, and this time subsequently ceased or was interrupted because of the father’s criminal behaviour or drug use, it could likely have a long term impact on x’s development and mental health[10]. it would result in x being subjected to the cycle of expectation and disappointment about which ms d warned, and (e) mr machak has outstanding criminal charges which may lead to his reincarceration.   the father cannot meet the costs of a private supervisor, nor can he meet the costs of ongoing hair follicle testing, (c) the mother has expressed that she does not feel x is protected from harm if only the paternal grandmother acts as a supervisor, as the paternal grandmother is also fearful of mr machak. dr c’s report notes that mr machak’s familial past resulted in him doing as he pleases and there must be serious doubt about whether his mother, an ageing woman, could effectively supervise time. i note also there is no evidence from the paternal grandmother to reassure the court about her capacity or willingness to supervise contact between x and her son, (d) if the court were to order supervised time, and this time subsequently ceased or was interrupted because of the father’s criminal behaviour or drug use, it could likely have a long term impact on x’s development and mental health[10]. it would result in x being subjected to the cycle of expectation and disappointment about which ms d warned, and (e) mr machak has outstanding criminal charges which may lead to his reincarceration.   the mother has expressed that she does not feel x is protected from harm if only the paternal grandmother acts as a supervisor, as the paternal grandmother is also fearful of mr machak. dr c’s report notes that mr machak’s familial past resulted in him doing as he pleases and there must be serious doubt about whether his mother, an ageing woman, could effectively supervise time. i note also there is no evidence from the paternal grandmother to reassure the court about her capacity or willingness to supervise contact between x and her son, (d) if the court were to order supervised time, and this time subsequently ceased or was interrupted because of the father’s criminal behaviour or drug use, it could likely have a long term impact on x’s development and mental health[10]. it would result in x being subjected to the cycle of expectation and disappointment about which ms d warned, and (e) mr machak has outstanding criminal charges which may lead to his reincarceration.   if the court were to order supervised time, and this time subsequently ceased or was interrupted because of the father’s criminal behaviour or drug use, it could likely have a long term impact on x’s development and mental health[10]. it would result in x being subjected to the cycle of expectation and disappointment about which ms d warned, and (e) mr machak has outstanding criminal charges which may lead to his reincarceration.   mr machak has outstanding criminal charges which may lead to his reincarceration.
