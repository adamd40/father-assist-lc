reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
the applications
were the court to grant that 'leave', then i request the court to find that it is not 'just and equitable' for a property settlement to occur between [mr hines] and i, and that the property should 'lie where it falls' as of our separation date ([mid]-2020).   hines] deliberately contributed nothing to the mortgage repayments, loan repayments for the solar system, council rates, house insurance premiums and costs for the maintenance of the house, as a means to exert financial hardship on me. this was done in order to achieve his goal of forcing me back into a relationship through his financial pressure. these are the types of liabilities that a potential interested party should have been contributing to, in order to protect that interest after the breakdown of a relationship, especially if that party wished to re-establish that relationship, not through coercion, but through compassion and empathy.[6]
i consider my 'contributions' made to the relationship and the assets associated with it, to outweigh those of [mr hines] by 33.57%, and as such, i appeal to the court to determine a 83.57% - 16.43% division of the property pool valued at approximately $1,088,000, in my favour, based on those 'contributions' overall.[7]
as to the future capacity of the parties to earn income by way of employment, i believe this to be equal. the difference in our ages being offset by my medical conditions, and my anticipated need to cease work within the next 1-2 years due to those conditions. as to the accommodation needs of the parties in the future, i contend that [mr hines] is content in living rent free at his mother's house and will continue to do so until her house passes to him due to her testamentary wishes, whenever this was to occur. i contend that it is not 'just and equitable' for final orders to be made in this application, following the court's considerations made under sub-section 90sm (3) of the family law act 1975 (the act). the main reason for this contention is that both parties present and 'future needs' are currently being met, and will continue to be met in the future, without such orders being made. this current equitability cannot be matched by any final orders being made based on 'contributions' alone.[8]
the evidence
chronology  easton] has had to reduce her working hours as a [health care worker] from full-time to part-time due to the amount of shifts she has been unable to work due to an increase in both [her medical condition] and periodic bouts of insomnia. these conditions greatly reduce her ability to increase her hours. in addition, she is not always able to meet her current part-time hours (40 hours per fortnight) causing her additional stress. [ms easton] is extremely passionate about her role as a [health care worker] and is a valuable member of staff. [ms easton], however, has plans to retire between the ages of 60 -63 after a long and rewarding career.[13]
i assisted with house duties, including cleaning and helped look after the children when i was not working. i contributed my labour to the improvements to the home. i have also regularly attended to maintenance around the home during our relationship and post separation.[16]
applicable legal provisions
the reference to “financial resources” in the context of s 75(2)(b) has long been correctly interpreted by the family court to refer to “a source of financial support which a party can reasonably expect will be available to him or her to supply a financial need or deficiency”. the requirement that the financial resource be that “of” a party no doubt implies that the source of financial support be one on which the party is capable of drawing. it must involve something more than an expectation of benevolence on the part of another. but it goes too far to suggest that the party must control the source of financial support. thus, it has long correctly been recognised that a nominated beneficiary of a discretionary trust, who has no control over the trustee but who has a reasonable expectation that the trustee’s discretion will be exercised in his or her favour, has a financial resource to the extent of that expectation.
... the bald assertion that one of the parties has an elderly relative who has property and is or is likely to benefit that party is so speculative that it would be inappropriate to contemplate it as relevant in a s.79 determination, it being too remote to affect the justice and equity of the case in any worthwhile way.
the question therefore has to be asked whether, in the present case, it would be just and equitable to the husband for the court to have ignored the probability that, in what could well be [a] very short period of time (given the ages of her aunt and mother), the wife could well be the owner of two properties having a combined value of almost the same amount as the value of the parties' property currently available for distribution, and particularly in circumstances where the husband had been found to have done substantial improvement and maintenance work on both properties? we consider that it would have been unjust to the husband to ignore this matter even if it was categorised only as a possibility and not a probability. ... it is true that the wife's mother may change her will again (particularly bearing in mind her history in this regard), it is true that the parties' son may challenge, and successfully challenge, the will of the aunt, it is true that changes in social security law, or the costs of maintaining the aunt or the mother and/or their properties may ultimately erode the significant equity which they current have in their properties ... but it is also true that within the very near future, the wife may own two properties totalling in value close to half a million dollars...[25]
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[29]
although the high court did not disapprove the four step process, we accept it did not approve it either... however, the high court’s decision serves to refocus attention on the obligation not to make an order adjusting property interests unless it is just and equitable to do so. ... stanford will also serve as a reminder that the four step process ‘merely illuminates the path to the ultimate result’.[31]
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of the choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be affected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying section 79(4).[32]
... there will be cases, of which stanford may have been one, where the assertion (or lack thereof) of an existing equitable interest in property held by the other party may be of critical importance in deciding whether it be just and equitable to determine whether it would be just and equitable to interfere with the existing legal ownership.[34]
as a result of those matters, the court’s approach to section79/section 90sm may be less compartmentalised than what a strict or unthinking adherence to four (or three) “steps” might otherwise reveal. the task is essentially holistic, is it just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the particular relationship or marriage under consideration to make an order and, if so, its terms must similarly meet that criteria. of course, holistic though the approach is, it must be referenced to what the act requires and care must be taken to ensure that the court’s reasons make that clear. [36]
it is well established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties’ respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the post separation period to the point of assessment.
if there is no other way to do that which is just and equitable then a sale must take place. it becomes an incident of the sad fact that, when two persons separate, property which might have given them together a reasonable competence will not be sufficient for each when divided. that is an inescapable situation and cannot be used as an argument to deprive one party of that to which he or she is otherwise properly entitled.[39]
in summary, then, the trial judge has a discretion as to how superannuation interests will be treated in a particular case. if superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to: (a) value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable. in the context of a consideration of the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of the last paragraph, the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse’s present and/or future entitlements under the fund.[41]   value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.   consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.   consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.   ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.
where the court has determined that it is just and equitable to make an order pursuant to section 79(2) or section 90sm(3) and there is clear evidence that one party has engaged in conduct and, but for that conduct, the legal and equitable interests of a party or the parties (or the value of those interests) would have be significantly greater, justice and equity may require recognition of the unfairness inherent in those circumstances in the terms of the orders to be made. how might that be recognised? first, consistent with existing authority, it can be recognised pursuant to section 75(2)(o) (cf section 90sf(3)(r)). secondly, it might be contended that it might be recognised within the assessment of contributions. this court has long eschewed the notion of “negative contributions”. nevertheless, it might be argued that the “non-dissipating party” can be seen to have made a disproportionally greater indirect contribution to the existing legal and equitable interests (for example to their preservation) if it is established that, but for the other party’s unilateral dissipation, those existing legal and equitable interests would have been greater or had a greater value. the assessment of the circumstance under discussion is, ultimately, a matter of discretion. equally, however, authority dictates that it will be “the exception rather than the rule” that a direct dollar adjustment equivalent to the amount of the alleged dissipation of the pool is made to the otherwise entitlement of a party. it may be that aspects of the erstwhile treatment of legal fees pre-stanford will require further consideration in an appropriate case. importantly, of course, as has been emphasised in many authorities including those cited above, not every dissipation by a party can be seen to involve an affront to justice and equity, again the circumstances of the individual relationship must be assessed. (citations removed)[49]
two fundamental premises emerge from ajo & gro and the authorities preceding it. first, ‘adding back’ is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not ‘exceptional’ justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is ‘a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct’ than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.

step two – assessment of contributions
the task of evaluating and comparing the parties’ respective contributions where one party has exclusively been the breadwinner and the other exclusively the homemaker, is a most difficult one to perform because the evaluation and comparison cannot be conducted on a “level playing field”. firstly, it involves making a crucial comparison between fundamentally different activities, and a comparison between contributions to property and contributions to the welfare of the family. secondly, whilst a breadwinner contribution can be objectively assessed by reference to such things as that party’s employment record, income and the value of the assets acquired, an assessment of the quality of a homemaker contribution to the family is vulnerable to subjective value judgments as to what constitutes a competent homemaker and parent and cannot be readily equated to the value of assets acquired. this leads to a tendency to undervalue the homemaker role.[56]
the task of the court in proceedings under s 79 is not akin to an accounting exercise. the task is to examine the facts of each case carefully to decide what is appropriate and just and equitable in the circumstances. there cannot be expected to be a universal answer to that question on any given set of facts. it is of the essence of judicial discretion that different minds may comfortably arrive at different conclusions. by and large, marriage is a joint venture where parties can expect to buffer each other from the winds of misfortune that blow during the course of their relationship. the degree of the buffer may depend on how much individual sailing they do without consultation or indeed contrary to the wishes of the other. but there can be no certain answer to how much that should be when applying s.79 principles.
step three – the prospective needs of the parties
conclusions and construction of final orders
given the evaluation of contribution based entitlements inevitably moves from qualitative evaluation of contributions to a quantitative reflection of such evaluation, there will inevitably be a “leap” from words to figures. that is the nature of the exercise of discretion, whether it be in the assessment of contributions in the matrimonial cause, assessment of damages in a personal injuries case, or determination of compensation in a land resumption case...
