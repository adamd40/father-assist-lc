the hearing
the father’s case  town k, where the father lives, has no local primary schools and so the child would have to travel for approximately 45 to 50 minutes to the nearest school in town p or town q, this travel being by bus or driven by the father. (b) the population of town k is just over 100 people but there are children who live there and a playground near the father’s house. (c) the father’s current employment is based in city b and if he had sole custody of the child, he would give up full-time employment and instead work casually as often as possible whilst relying on a single parenting payment. he said he didn’t want or expect to be on a parenting payment forever but agreed he had told dr l that it would be difficult for him to manage financially as a single parent if he was the primary carer. he also agreed he had discussed seeking financial support from his family with dr l. (d) he denied driving dangerously or above the speed limit and said the “local wildlife” he had told dr l about was an estimate of how many he would have hit over many years of driving in rural areas with a lot of unfenced properties. (e) the father described different toys he had bought for the child as gifts. (f) when shown a list of “instructions for [x]”[8] that the mother had written, the father said that, although he objected to some items on the list such as “no fast food” and “no heights”, he had complied with them. (g) he agreed that he had sent the mother text messages referring to having “kicked her out” and calling her an “evil bitch”.[9]   the population of town k is just over 100 people but there are children who live there and a playground near the father’s house.

evidence of single expert – dr l  his reasoning for why it had been difficult to obtain a detailed account of the mother’s present or past psychiatric health was that she may not have been good at reflecting on her internal state and was being guarded. he agreed it was possible she may have been guarded because she thought it could damage her case in this court. (b) dr l explained the difference between mental conditions and an “overvalued idea”, although he noted that distinguishing between the two can be very difficult. he stated that an overvalued idea is a belief someone develops that is still subject to reasonable consideration and has developed for rational reasons, although that belief may be so strongly held it doesn’t change. in contrast, a mental disorder often develops for psychotic reasons, is held with stronger conviction and does not change when evidence to the contrary is provided. (c) he stated that the mother’s lack of insight and inability to shift perspective even when presented with evidence, such as a negative test result from a supervised test, means her belief that the father poses a serious risk to the child because of his alleged drug use is likely to be persistent. (d) he noted that the mother didn’t remember details of her own psychiatric history that he would expect her to remember, referring to her involuntary admission to hospital as an example. (e) he considered it unlikely that the father was using drugs in the way described by the mother, noting the absence of any drug offences in his criminal record and his negative test results. (f) he agreed that the majority of people would be frustrated by consistent and frequent allegations being made against them by another person, such as those made by the mother about the father’s alleged drug use and unfaithfulness. dr l went on to say that whether asking someone to leave a home was a reasonable response to such frustration would depend on the context. (g) when asked about the likelihood of the mother returning to her previous conduct of not facilitating time with the father after the suspended sentence imposed on her lapsed, dr l stated that behaviours changed under duress will generally revert back to the original behaviour once the duress is removed. (h) he considered it likely that the mother has a mental disorder, and hypothesised that her attachment needs were currently being met by the child and had been since his birth. (i) he opined that that mental disorder was a more likely diagnosis than schizophrenia. (j) the personality traits he identified in the mother from the collateral history provided to him included fear of abandonment, difficulties with self-esteem, and problems with emotional regulation under stress. (k) he recommended that the mother should receive, and actively engage in, treatment from a psychiatrist for the mental disorder for a period of six to 12 months, as well as with a psychologist, and that any such treaters should be provided with a copy of her psychiatric history. (l) he said that the requirement to engage in treatment can assist in a person gaining insight. he also noted that gaining insight was far more likely in a person with a mental disorder where they responded positively to antipsychotic medication. (m) he agreed that any order by the court to increase the father’s time with the child could affect the mother’s attachments and be stressful to her. he went on to state that this stress may manifest as increasingly intense beliefs and concerns about risk until a point at which the mother may feel her only option is to flee the situation and take the child with her. this hypothesis was based on her past history of traveling when she becomes stressed by a situation. (n) dr l said that an order changing the child’s residence to live with the father or to spend overnight time with him would be more of a stressor for the mother than the child commencing full-time school. he stated that a graduated increase in time towards overnight time may minimise the mother’s stress, although he noted previous attempts at such an approach had not been particularly effective.   dr l explained the difference between mental conditions and an “overvalued idea”, although he noted that distinguishing between the two can be very difficult. he stated that an overvalued idea is a belief someone develops that is still subject to reasonable consideration and has developed for rational reasons, although that belief may be so strongly held it doesn’t change. in contrast, a mental disorder often develops for psychotic reasons, is held with stronger conviction and does not change when evidence to the contrary is provided.

(m) he agreed that any order by the court to increase the father’s time with the child could affect the mother’s attachments and be stressful to her. he went on to state that this stress may manifest as increasingly intense beliefs and concerns about risk until a point at which the mother may feel her only option is to flee the situation and take the child with her. this hypothesis was based on her past history of traveling when she becomes stressed by a situation. (n) dr l said that an order changing the child’s residence to live with the father or to spend overnight time with him would be more of a stressor for the mother than the child commencing full-time school. he stated that a graduated increase in time towards overnight time may minimise the mother’s stress, although he noted previous attempts at such an approach had not been particularly effective.   he recommended that the mother should receive, and actively engage in, treatment from a psychiatrist for the mental disorder for a period of six to 12 months, as well as with a psychologist, and that any such treaters should be provided with a copy of her psychiatric history.

(b) he agreed that the father had told him he was using drugs three or four years ago, which would be around the time the mother was pregnant. (c) when asked why he had not investigated the father’s medical history as thoroughly as the mother’s, dr l replied that the father’s history – attending a counsellor a few times 20 years ago and being prescribed a medication he only took twice – didn’t seem relevant to the questions he was being asked, or warrant further investigation. (d) he disagreed with the mother that the father’s “medical condition” which he had reported was the result of drug or alcohol withdrawal, instead stating it could be caused by caffeine or nicotine withdrawal. (e) when questioned about whether the father’s planning or lack thereof gave rise to any concerns in terms of his parenting capacity, dr l said that he found it odd that the father had purchased a property in rural tasmania because of the difficulty this could cause in terms of co-parenting logistics. he agreed that the court child expert seemed to share this view and as a result, questioned the father’s capacity to reflect on the child’s best interests. (f) he initially stated that he was not concerned that the father’s short sleep patterns, on average three to five hours per night, posed a risk to the child but later clarified that he had not taken a specific enough history to be able to draw that conclusion and so withdrew it. (g) he disagreed that having any amount of drugs in your system necessarily posed a greater risk of neglect by the person of someone in their care. he gave the responsible consumption of alcohol as an example of something that did not adversely affect many people’s parenting abilities. (h) the mother repeatedly put to dr l that it didn’t “make sense” to diagnose her with a mental disorder when there was evidence that showed the father posed a risk to the child, being evidence of domestic violence, reckless driving, and drug and alcohol use. when she asked him if he had taken this “evidence” into consideration when writing his report and diagnosing her, he said he had.   he agreed that the father had told him he was using drugs three or four years ago, which would be around the time the mother was pregnant.
