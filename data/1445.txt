legal principles
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s 60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[8]  tations omitted)

the father’s violence towards the mother
to separation
right. do you recall – so, you recall sending this message. did you ever apologise for that?---i did apologise, but i know that apologies - - - sorry?---i did apologise to her. every time i did assault her – i know that’s not an excuse or anything, and it’s – i’m ashamed to talk about this – but i would apologise to her, but then i would somehow do it again.
the account given by the [father] ... is consistent with violence resistance behaviour, however it could also be explained by conflict instigated violence... if there is veracity to [the father’s]... account then [the mother]... may benefit from attending counselling to learn strategies that are aimed at assisting her improve her emotional regulation, however if her behaviour is one of violence resistance then she may benefit from counselling to obtain support for her experiences of family violence.
father’s behaviour after separation
is the father a changed man? st of many courses undertaken by the father]
so you didn’t care that there was an avo in place when you contacted her, did you?---i – i did care, but – i – i did care and i – i was worried. it was a decision that i had to make. it was a decision that i was willing to take. so the idea of potential imprisonment didn’t deter you from contacting her in any way, is that the case?---i didn’t think that the – i knew that i will be charged but i – i didn’t think that i will go to jail. well, it says in big black letter on the first page of the avo:
you could be arrested by police and charged. if you are convicted you could go to prison and be fined.
you didn’t think that was going to happen?---i – i – i believed that, if i was to threaten her or assault her, that that would happen. i feel like that – the way of my breach, it was still a breach. i’m not justifying that i didn’t listen to court orders in respect to that. it was – it was hanging out, having lunch and stuff of that nature. i didn’t believe that that kind of avo – well, i knew it was serious, the breach, but i didn’t think it was that serious of what i’ve previously done to [ms karnik]. well, sir, you understand that an avo is a form of court order?---i do. and if her honour were to make parenting order, those would be a court order, correct?---correct. so what faither can – well, what comfort can you give her honour that you are to comply with the orders that she makes?---this has taken a toll on my life. i want to know – i’ve been resolving the last couple of years for this day. whatever the orders are made i will respect them. i know i have not respected court orders before. i will respect them and i will continue on with my life.
family report recommendations
this behaviour may be indicative of [the father] being unable to accept restrictions placed upon him and he is focused on prioritising his needs rather than those of [x] or [the mother]. it would appear that this behaviour is attempting to illicit fear in [the mother] and control her behaviour and this is also [sic] raises significant concern that [the father] would not follow court orders in relation to spending time with [x]. if it is determined that this allegation has veracity then this raises concern for his capacity for change. it appears likely that the level of violence described between [sic] by [the mother] would significantly impact consideration of parenting proposals in this matter.   that each parent undertake a hair drug test to understand if this is a matter requiring consideration, (b) that x live with the mother, (c) if it is determined x is at an unacceptable risk of harm with the father including his alleged behaviour towards the mother, that x spend no time and have no communication with the father, and (d) the mother have sole parental responsibility.   that x live with the mother, (c) if it is determined x is at an unacceptable risk of harm with the father including his alleged behaviour towards the mother, that x spend no time and have no communication with the father, and (d) the mother have sole parental responsibility.   if it is determined x is at an unacceptable risk of harm with the father including his alleged behaviour towards the mother, that x spend no time and have no communication with the father, and (d) the mother have sole parental responsibility.   the mother have sole parental responsibility.
it would be looking at the – that on an ongoing basis, and if it was positive time, if there was a supportive relationship towards the mother, then yes, a situation where supervision is in place could work. identity time came from an adoption space, not a separated parent space. so it has not been proven to be – like, long-term supervision has not been shown to be, like, a positive thing if there’s risk and a history of violence. that would need to be taken into consideration. again, it’s outweighing – or weighing up the benefits to the child verses the risk to the child.
if the father was cognisant of his behaviour, the impact that it has had on the mother, the impact that it has on the child and that he had put in steps or interventions to change his behaviour and the way he viewed the mother and that relationship – ongoing counselling, for example, could be useful, his ability to support the mother’s relationship, support the decisions about the child and facilitate that on an ongoing basis.
