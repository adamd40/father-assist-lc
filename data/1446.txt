applicable law  in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.
it follows that if an order made by consent must be treated like any other non-consensual court order it must be read and interpreted quite independently of what the parties subjectively might have intended thereby. it must be rea as standing on its own feet, as it were.
if a party has acted in the manner to which i have referred earlier either by: (a) embarking upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) acting recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value then such conduct in my view and the economic consequences which flow here from are clearly matters to which the court may have regard pursuant to the provisions of sec. 75(2)(o). if, on the other hand, loses of a financial kind have been suffered by the parties to a marriage in the course of the pursuit of matrimonial objectives, such as the gaining of income or the acquisition of assets whether the liability for such losses joint or several, then in my view, such losses should be shared by the parties (although not necessarily equally) and taking into account when altering property interests.   embarking upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) acting recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value   acting recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value
section 79a setting aside of orders altering property interests   where, on application by a person affected by an order made by a court under section 79 in property settlement proceedings, the court is satisfied that: (a) there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of fraud, duress, suppression of evidence (including failure to disclose relevant information), the giving of false evidence or any other circumstance, or (b) in the circumstances that have arisen since the order was made it is impracticable for the order to be carried out or impracticable for a part of the order to be carried out, or (c) a person has defaulted in carrying out an obligation imposed on the person by the order and, in the circumstances that have arisen as a result of that default, it is just and equitable to vary the order or to set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order, or[3]   there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of fraud, duress, suppression of evidence (including failure to disclose relevant information), the giving of false evidence or any other circumstance, or (b) in the circumstances that have arisen since the order was made it is impracticable for the order to be carried out or impracticable for a part of the order to be carried out, or (c) a person has defaulted in carrying out an obligation imposed on the person by the order and, in the circumstances that have arisen as a result of that default, it is just and equitable to vary the order or to set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order, or[3]   in the circumstances that have arisen since the order was made it is impracticable for the order to be carried out or impracticable for a part of the order to be carried out, or (c) a person has defaulted in carrying out an obligation imposed on the person by the order and, in the circumstances that have arisen as a result of that default, it is just and equitable to vary the order or to set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order, or[3]   a person has defaulted in carrying out an obligation imposed on the person by the order and, in the circumstances that have arisen as a result of that default, it is just and equitable to vary the order or to set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order, or[3]
... the court may, in its discretion, vary the order or set the order aside and, if it considers appropriate, make another order under section 79 in substitution for the order so set aside. ... phasis and footnotes added)
... a miscarriage of justice under s 79a(1)(a) will occur if circumstances exist which “for some significant reason, make the order contrary to law and justice according to law as it relates to the integrity of the judicial process [original emphasis]” (bigg v suzi (supra) at 84,982). see also suiker (supra), public trustee (as executor of the estate of gilbert) v gilbert (supra)). whilst cases such as suiker (supra), holland v holland [1982] famca 31, (1982) flc 91-243 and gebert v gebert [1990] famca 105, (1990) flc 92-137 indicate that the words “miscarriage of justice” should not be construed narrowly and the phrase “integrity of the judicial process” should not be taken only to refer to the hearing in the court, the circumstances creating the miscarriage must nevertheless have been such as to have had an influence on the outcome of the litigation...  phasis added)
parties bound by the conduct of their case
the wife’s case
... [in mid] 2023, [mr ping] replied my email saying that he would not pay me $200,432 because the settlement sum had changed. he said that he would recalculate the overall adjustment of net asset. annexed hereto and marked “[xinya]-7”is a copy of the email dated [mid] 2023. i was confused because my understanding of the final orders was that [mr ping] must pay me the settlement sum of $200,432 after selling the property because he could not make the payment within 90 days of the date of the order. ... my application before the court at final hearing (as amended)[7] was that in default was worded as follows:
“in the event that the husband has not paid to the wife the amount referred in paragraph one within 60 days of these orders, then the husband shall immediately do all things and sign all documents necessary to sell the [suburb c] property and the proceeds of sale shall be applied in the following order and priority:
i. firstly, to pay all costs associated with the sale, secondly, to discharge the mortgage with [h bank] against [suburb c] property, iii. thirdly, pay to the wife the greater of: (emphasis added)
iv. the balance to be paid to the husband.” based on the wording of the orders which i sought in my application at trial[8], i believe that the court would have been aware that i was seeking that the settlement sum be a fixed payment, with that sum only to be varied in the event that the pool had increased by reason of the [suburb c] property selling for more than it was valued at trial. this would be reasonable in my view, because the price might increase by reason of the delays involved with a default sale. that seems to be a commonsense and fair interpretation of the way things should work in a default situation, otherwise my court ordered entitlements would be at risk of being adversely affected in an unpredictable manner if the property were to be sold unilaterally by [mr ping] for significantly less than its agreed value. if it was not the intention of the court to protect my entitlements in this way (notwithstanding any slip or error in the orders which might on the face of it suggest otherwise) then i would have expected to act as co-vendor on the sale of [suburb c] to protect my entitlements and get the best sale price for that matrimonial asset. however, under the final orders, [mr ping] had the sole and unilateral conduct of the sale. this meant that under the current wording of the final orders, i was vulnerable to [mr ping] selling for less than market value (in a way which defeated my proper entitlement to the settlement sum). this was because in default of [mr ping] making payment of a fixed dollar value amount due on 23 october 2022 under the final orders, it converted to a percentage of a variable pool if [mr ping] defaulted in payment (with [mr ping] controlling the relevant variable in the pool, namely the sale price of [suburb c]). further, i was vulnerable in the sense that i was unable to control that variable (sale price of [suburb c]), because [mr ping] was not obliged under the final orders to consult me in any way in respect of the default sale and did not keep me properly informed.

the husband’s evidence as to the sale
“according to the court order, you must give me the money within 90 days, otherwise you need to sell the [suburb c] house immediately. it will be exactly 90 days. if you haven’t started selling the house after that, i will ask the court to enforce it. i have consulted and the cycle for selling a house is about one month. please sell the house before the end of [the year] and hand it over within 60 days. i hope you don’t delay deliberately. i can ask the court to give you a time limit.” ... i have a wife and two infant children, and my elderly parents reside with us. my wife, children and parents are wholly dependent on me for financial support. i was fearful that if i did not sell the [suburb c] property quickly and before [late] 2022, [the wife] would make a court application against me. i experienced significant anxiety and stress in the lead up to and during the final hearing of our initial proceedings. i was fearful of [the wife] issuing court proceedings against me, and i was worried that i would experience great financial and emotional strain if i did not comply with the orders and [the wife]’s demands. i do not know any selling agents so i asked my friend, [mr w], if he knew any agents to recommend to me. on or around [late] 2022, my friend recommended [mr u] of [v company] and sent me [mr u]’s phone number. page 18 of the bundle exhibit contains a true and correct copy of the messages exchanged between me and [mr w] [in late] 2022 where [mr w] provides me [mr u]’s phone number. on or around [late] 2022, i met [mr w] for the first time. [mr u] inspected the [suburb c] property. [mr u] made some comments to me regarding the condition of the [suburb c] property and he recommended that i undertake some maintenance works to prepare the property for sale, such as [some] repairs. i told [mr u] that i was required to sell the property pursuant to a court order and i showed [mr u] a copy of the court orders with respect to the [suburb c] property. i asked that [mr u] achieve the best possible selling price. i was later provided with an exclusive sale authority by [mr u]. i signed the exclusive sale authority [in late] 2022. in response to paragraphs 38 to 41 inclusive of [the wife]’s affidavit, i say that the [suburb c] property was maintained throughout the sale process and settlement period. i attended to all repairs suggested by [mr u] prior to the sale, including mowing the front lawn. i also paid for and completed other repairs recommended by [mr u]. the tenant had been living in the [suburb c] property for around ten years and never complained that i had not maintained the house. the [suburb c] property was around fifty years old at the time of sale and its condition had expectedly declined over time. the renovations required to be carried out to the [suburb c] property would have likely been extensive. i found the tenant’s cleanliness to be reasonable during the period of tenancy. the condition of the [suburb c] property has remained consistent in the last three to four years. the [suburb c] property was listed on the market in [late] 2022 with an asking price range of $800,000 to $880,000. i did not determine the selling price but rather, i listened to the advice of the selling agent as the professional who suggested the price range. the property was listed for private sale and i understand that there were regular open inspections conducted by the selling agent. the marketing campaign included online advertisements of the property, and the [v company] website, a sale signage board at the property, brochures, and drop cards which were distributed. the marketing costs amounted to $[4,200] to the best of my knowledge, no offers within the asking price range of $800,000 to $880,000 were received by the selling agent. [mr u] informed me that there were low levels of interest in the property and very few attendees at the open inspections. [mr u] told me that [in late] 2022, a conditional offer for $685,000 was received for the [suburb c] property, despite the asking price range of $800,000 to $880,000. the offer was subject to a building and pest inspection, finance approval, vacant possession, and the removal of unwanted articles in the driveway. the offer was not accepted due to the conditions sought by this prospective buyer. [in late] 2022, [mr u] told me that he thought it was unlikely he could achieve a sale price in the asking range of $800,000 to $880,000. [mr u] told me that i should consider offers in the price range of $700,000 to $770,000 based on recent sales and the urgency to sell the [suburb c] property. i was disappointed that the [suburb c] property would likely not sell for more however, given the constraints the orders placed on me and [mr u], i accepted his advice.
the evidence of the selling agent
the single expert valuer’s evidence
“market value” in this report is defined as: - “market value is the estimated amount for which an asset or liability should exchange on the valuation date between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's length transaction, after proper marketing and where the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion”. the definition assumes: a willing but not anxious vendor and purchaser, with no duress or compulsion, a reasonable period in which to negotiate the sale, taking into account the value of the property and the state of the market, the value will remain static throughout the period, the property will be fully exposed to the market. the basis of valuation assumes: freehold title subject to vacant possession. included in the amount of this valuation are normal fixtures and fittings. excluded from the amount of this valuation are items of furniture and furnishings, and occupant's fixtures and fittings. this valuation is determined on the basis that the property, the title thereto and its use are not affected by any matter other than those mentioned in this report. the valuation has been prepared in conformity with the code of professional ethics and conduct adopted by the australian property institute. this valuation is for the use only of the parties to whom it is addressed and for no other purpose. no responsibility is accepted to any third party who may use or rely on the whole or any part of the content of this valuation. the date of valuation is [late] 2022. ... the dwelling is [a large] home with a total living area of [...] sqm. the building has plasterboard internal linings and is in average condition with a functional layout. we have relied on our external observations from the kerbside and information provided by domantay legal from a previous redacted valuation report which contained several photographs of the improvements circa 2021. we note the report states several maintenance items were required and presentation was at best fair with the property tenanted. the external photographs show an overgrown front yard with general garden maintenance required. ... 12.1 housing demand and supply the covid-19 pandemic, low interest rates and low supply resulted in a strong real estate market in the [suburb c] in line with other parts of melbourne and regional markets. an extra layer of demand had come from buyers seeking a regional lifestyle supported by a new work from home paradigm. these fundamentals have been playing out through 2020 and 2021 with agents reporting the market normalizing this year. not all properties were selling above the advertised range, which was the norm in the rising market conditions in the prior two years and price adjustments from agents after several weeks of marketing became evident. values were still historically high with signs of an easing market, interest rate rises, and higher fuel prices placed further pressure on values with the market shifting in favour of buyers where the property is run of the mill. unique or ‘blue chip’ properties continued to perform well. the subject property having a dated façade and interior would have fallen into the ’run of the mill’ category and have been price sensitive however the sale price recorded on rp data core logic appears to be severely discounted. ... the valuation report has assessed the property against relevant comparable sales evidence to arrive at its conclusion on value. the background to the marketing campaign raises concerns with the valuer as to the motivation/process employed to sell the property. reducing an asking price by 22.5% within three weeks of launching is a significant reduction in price and can impair the outcome of achieving fair market value. the selling process has no bearing on the derived value in the valuation report however is certainly a factor in the eventual sale price. ... the agent indicates he regards the above sales as similar to the subject property with a value range of $670,000 to $750,000. if the agent believes the comparable sales evidence indicated a value range of $670,000 to $750,000 why was it listed at $800,000 to $880,000? the valuation report relies on comparable market evidence to derive its conclusion. the comments and opinions of the agent appear contradictory when the advertising copy states an immaculate home yet when struggling to achieve the anticipated sale price in the initial range advertised, the presented condition of the dwelling is used as the reason to discount the price by 22.5% within 3 weeks of launching – we note rp data still lists the only advertised range at $800,000 to $880,000. the valuation assumes that the dwelling is in a dated/poor condition with the comparable sales evidence used in the report the most relevant to the subject property. the new evidence provided has been analysed against the subject property with the sale at [x street, suburb c] the only sale providing compelling evidence to review the initial valuation figure.
