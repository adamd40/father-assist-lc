reasons for judgment
judge glass:
primary considerations
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both of her parents
the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
additional considerations
any views expressed by x and any factors (such as her maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to her views
the nature of x’s relationships with each of her parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to her, to spend time with her, and to communicate with her
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain her
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances, including the likely effect on her of any separation from either of her parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom she has been living
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect x’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of x’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of hers, to provide for her needs, including emotional and intellectual needs
in response to this application for parenting orders, [ms kaplin] made false allegations of family violence about me to both court[s], in order to attempt to deny access to our daughter, which she had repeatedly threatened to do as part of her emotional and psychological abuse towards me, and place herself in a position of power and control in regards to making parenting arrangements for our daughter.[20]
mr gallion clarified in oral evidence that the claimed emotional and psychological abuse was ms kaplin’s threat that he would never see his daughter again.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of either of her parents, and any other relevant characteristics of x
if x is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child, her right to enjoy her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to x, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of her parents  kaplin] showed some understanding of her previous poor mental health, and the consequence of this upon her willingness to allow [x] to spend time with her father. [ms kaplin] presented with a level of anxiety and a need to control her environment and familial dynamics. [ms kaplin] also struggled to accept that [x] will be unable to develop a meaningful relationship with her father if she is only able to spend time with him in small increments over the coming years.[39]
any family violence involving x or a member of her family
... it seems undeniable that [x] has been exposed to substantial violence across all domains, which was perpetrated against her mother. this violence was apparently characterised by physical, sexual, emotional, economic, psychological and social forms of abuse, which reportedly began in the first year of the relationship and escalated during [ms kaplin]’s pregnancy with [x]. [ms kaplin]’s allegations appear consistent with information provided by [mr gallion]’s ex-wife during previous proceedings. given the similarity of information reported by [ms kaplin] and [mr gallion]’s ex-wife, [ms kaplin]’s reports of family violence perpetrated by [mr gallion] potentially need to be given some credence.[42]
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of her family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
prior to [x]'s commencement of prep but no earlier than [early] 2026 and no later than [late] 2026, the parties engage in dispute resolution to discuss any change to the father's spend time arrangements, school holiday arrangements and travel arrangements with [x], with such dispute resolution to be undertaken at the joint expense of the parties.[43]
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility
i’ve always got concerns about one party being excluded from decision making, i guess particularly when there has been a pattern of the other party not being included in decision making. i’m also not entirely sure that if the mother in this matter had sole parental responsibility and she was ordered to include the father in decision making beforehand or to advise him of decisions made afterwards, i’m not entirely sure that that would happen.
