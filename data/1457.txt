reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
these types of co-parenting dynamics invariably affect children and their emotional wellbeing, behaviours and developmental trajectory. it is possible that [x] has internalised the current dispute and poor co-parenting relationship, which is being expressed as fear and separation anxiety. long-term exposure to parental conflict and poor communication has the potential to have a detrimental impact on her own communication and sense of self that may present later in life.[1]   finds it hard not to notice that her parents are not friends. it would mean a lot to her if they could be friend.
... what is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents’ proposals embraced in competing applications involve again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children’s best interests.[3]
the hearing of 20 may 2024
this has been raised as an issue for over a year ago. your continued tactics to delay or avoid the discussion are negatively impacting [x]’s daily life. i will be moving forward with a school enrolment. i appreciate you are not happy with this decision and would prefer her to stay at [g school], however i am taking this decision in what i believe to be [x]’s best interests...[6]
the father raised concerns today that the court never works around his availability which he advised the court today was that he would work 2 weeks at a time, but would not turn down other work offered to him. the matter was stood down to obtain the assistance from a duty lawyer to assist the mother and negotiate final orders with the father, after two hours, the court was advised by both parties that there was no agreement reached. the matter was stood down shortly thereafter. when the matter was called back on to pronounce orders and the reasons for those orders, the court was advised through security via the associate, that the father had left the building.
parental responsibility all major decisions to be agreed upon by both parties etc. school, health. which ever parent the child is with is agreed upon to make the right judgment for the child. neither parent is to withhold visitation from other parent. schooling to be choosen (sic) on what is best for the child not which ever school is closer. best interests that the child doesn’t need to see a therapist. that the childs name is not to be changed or altered in any way.[7]
background
the following document is an agreement between [ms laing] ([born] 1987) and [mr raimondo] ([born] 1988) in regards to the care of their daughter [x] ([born] 2013) [mr raimondo] gives consent for [x] to reside in england with [ms laing], as of [late] 2014 [ms laing] agrees to allow [mr raimondo] to visit [x] in england at any time, contributing where necessary and practicable to travel and accommodation costs and all other reasonable expenses. [mr raimondo] agrees to visit in [x] in england when practicable. whilst [x] resides in england with [ms laing], [ms laing] agrees to maintain regular contact between [x] and [mr raimondo], with a minimum commitment to: skype twice per week telephone contact twice per week written communication once per week printed photographs once per month [ms laing] agrees to maintain as much contact between [mr raimondo] and [x] as is reasonably practicable, and is requested by [mr raimondo] or [x]. this extends to contact between [x] and her paternal grandparents. [mr raimondo] agrees to maintain regular and meaningful contact with [x] [ms laing] and [mr raimondo] agree to review this agreement in february 2015 and create a new agreement in the best interests of [x]
the child impact report  is afraid to tell [mr raimondo] things, “because i’m scared of what he will think of me”. she said when he hears something he does not want the hear he gets really angry. “i find it hard to talk to dad because he sees things as either wrong or right. “dad’s a bit angry with me at the moment.” [x]’s biggest worry is hurting her mum and dad’s feelings. “i just feel like piggy in the middle between my parents and i just keep reaching up to try to catch their thoughts and feelings and words. but i keep missing them”. [x] finds it hard not to notice that her parents are not friends. it would mean a lot to her if they could be friends.[8]
legal considerations
decisions made by parents in ‘intact’ families about the education of their children commonly take into account the convenience of the parents, especially in working out transport arrangements. financial concerns are also routinely taken into account. consideration of these factors should not be seen as affording primacy to them over the interests of the children, since children’s interests cannot be viewed in isolation from the convenience and financial stability of their parents.
