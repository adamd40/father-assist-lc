uncontroversial evidence and facts
discussion of other evidence and relevant findings  although she has thought about obtaining australian citizenship, she has not pursued this because it would require her to abandon her country b citizenship and that would deprive her of holding assets there.[12] oddly, she later stated that she intended to become an australian citizen as soon as possible. (b) the mother recently inherited a one quarter share of property in country b following her parents passing away. she had previously held the title documents relating to this property but “a couple months ago” sent them to her brother in country b. the purpose of holding the documents in the first place and being required to send them back more recently was the subject of confusing and vague evidence, leading me to conclude that there was no plausible explanation and the mother was not being completely forthcoming. (c) the mother owns real property in australia, including p street, city q that she and the children live in, and another property that she will shortly complete the purchase of: n street, suburb o. she intends to rent the latter property as a holiday rental. (d) the mother has formal qualifications that she obtained in country b but said she would need to do further training to practice in her profession in country b. (e) the mother’s qualifications are not recognised in australia and she would need to undertake further study in australia to work as a professional. (f) the mother is presently studying a certificate course online, which should be completed by mid-2024. (g) the children do not speak country b language but the younger child is interested in learning it and the mother is teaching her. the elder child’s connection to country b culture is currently through blessings and prayers. otherwise, she said there are limited opportunities in tasmania to experience country b culture and language. (h) she has never made enquiries about country b citizenship for the children. she agreed that she looked into getting country b passports for the children in 2019 when they had to pay a fee for overstaying their visas while on holiday in country b. she said she has not made further enquiries since then and can only obtain country b passports for them if the father provides his signature. (i) the mother intends to travel to country b in early 2025 for a wedding and also in mid‑2025, and these are currently her only plans to travel. (j) that if she obtained her australian citizenship, she and the children could travel to country b and stay for a month on a holiday before needing to pay and apply for a further visa.   the mother recently inherited a one quarter share of property in country b following her parents passing away. she had previously held the title documents relating to this property but “a couple months ago” sent them to her brother in country b. the purpose of holding the documents in the first place and being required to send them back more recently was the subject of confusing and vague evidence, leading me to conclude that there was no plausible explanation and the mother was not being completely forthcoming.

(b) even if he were given 60 days’ notice of the mother’s travel with the children and he held the younger child’s passport when she is not travelling, he is concerned the children would not be returned to australia. (c) he cannot trust the mother. (d) he agrees that many, but not all, of the communications between the parents are courteous and added “we get by”. he also noted that communication had improved since using our family wizard. (e) the dispute about who the elder child should see for counselling arose because he wanted him to see a psychologist not a counsellor. he agreed he did not appreciate that the person at s centre, who the mother wanted the elder child to see, was in fact a psychologist. (f) he denied that his reaction to differences between the parents about counselling and vaccination was a case of “his way or the highway”, but agreed the only reason he considered the mother had a poor attitude to parenting related to her disagreeing with vaccinating the younger child at five years old. (g) he denied being controlling over finances or limiting the mother’s access to money during the relationship. rather he stated that their income was paid into their mortgage account and then drawn down if needed, and that this way of managing their finances applied to both of them. he said he always ensured the mother had $100 per week, half in cash and half in an account, and that she had access to a credit card with a $20,000 limit. he agreed he would check bank statements but he denied he did so to control the mother. (h) he denied that his attitude to the children’s travel to country b was reflective of his desire to control the mother. (i) he agreed he had spoken to the elder child about his worries of the children not returning to australia if they travel to country b. when asked to concede this was not optimal, he stated that he had been asked questions about travel to country b and he didn’t want to answer but felt like he had to. he agreed the elder child was aware about the conflict around travel to country b. (j) when asked by the icl when the discussion with the elder child referred to in the preceding subparagraph occurred, he stated he thought it was mid 2023 when the child asked him about international travel because his mother had told him about this issue. as the father’s answer referred to a diary note he had made at the time of the discussion, i made an order for it to be produced. it was subsequently produced,[13] and was the subject of closing submissions. (k) the elder child has not asked about international travel since the occasion referred to in subparagraphs [33](i) and (j) above. (l) he denied that he had spoken about the breakdown of the relationship with the children and said, “he’d always tried to shield them”, although he agreed he would answer questions when they asked. (m) he maintained that he initiated these proceedings because the elder child wanted, and had asked, to live with him. (n) he agreed that the elder child would probably be able to contact him from country b if he needed to. (o) he agreed that, when it related to his children, any degree of risk was unacceptable. however, in response to a question from the court he replied that he would be comfortable with the elder child travelling internationally now but would want the younger child to be 14 years old and for them both to be of an age where they were not reliant on each other.   even if he were given 60 days’ notice of the mother’s travel with the children and he held the younger child’s passport when she is not travelling, he is concerned the children would not be returned to australia. (c) he cannot trust the mother. (d) he agrees that many, but not all, of the communications between the parents are courteous and added “we get by”. he also noted that communication had improved since using our family wizard. (e) the dispute about who the elder child should see for counselling arose because he wanted him to see a psychologist not a counsellor. he agreed he did not appreciate that the person at s centre, who the mother wanted the elder child to see, was in fact a psychologist.
