“new” section 65daaa & “old” rule in rice & asplund
‘[s 65daaa.10] court not to reconsider a final parenting order unless it has considered whether there has been a significant change in circumstances: s 65daaa(1)’,[3]
professor richard chisholm sets out his understanding of what i now describe as the “old” rule in rice & asplund. with respect it is convenient to, and i do, adopt his description of the rule. professor chisholm opined as follows:
a pre-2024 full court summary of the principle is stern & colli [2022] fedcfamc1a 95 at [22], in which the full court said:
the primary judge’s task was a two-staged process. first, to make findings of fact as to what changes there had been in circumstances since the making of the 2015 orders and secondly, to assess whether or not the father had established that these changes are sufficient to provoke a new inquiry, or put in another way, whether the [applicant] has established a prima facie case of changed circumstances that would justify embarking on a second contested parenting hearing as being in the child’s best interests.  phasis added)
65daaa reconsideration of final parenting orders   if a final parenting order is in force in relation to a child, a court must not reconsider the final parenting order unless: (a) the court has considered whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made, and (b) the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances (and taking into account whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made), it is in the best interests of the child for the final parenting order to be reconsidered. (2) for the purposes of determining whether the court is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), and without limiting section 60cc, the court may have regard to any matters that the court considers relevant, including the following: (a) the reasons for the final parenting order and the material on which it was based, (b) whether there is any material available that was not available to the court that made the final parenting order, (c) the likelihood that, if the final parenting order is reconsidered, the court will make a new parenting order that affects the operation of the final parenting order in a significant way (whether by varying, discharging or suspending the final parenting order, in whole or in part, or in some other way), (d) any potential benefit, or detriment, to the child that might result from reconsidering the final parenting order. (3) despite subsection (1), the court may reconsider a final parenting order with the agreement or consent of all the parties to that order. (4) the failure of a court to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the validity of any order made by the court.   the court has considered whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made, and (b) the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances (and taking into account whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made), it is in the best interests of the child for the final parenting order to be reconsidered.   the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances (and taking into account whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made), it is in the best interests of the child for the final parenting order to be reconsidered.   for the purposes of determining whether the court is satisfied as mentioned in paragraph (1)(b), and without limiting section 60cc, the court may have regard to any matters that the court considers relevant, including the following: (a) the reasons for the final parenting order and the material on which it was based, (b) whether there is any material available that was not available to the court that made the final parenting order, (c) the likelihood that, if the final parenting order is reconsidered, the court will make a new parenting order that affects the operation of the final parenting order in a significant way (whether by varying, discharging or suspending the final parenting order, in whole or in part, or in some other way), (d) any potential benefit, or detriment, to the child that might result from reconsidering the final parenting order. (3) despite subsection (1), the court may reconsider a final parenting order with the agreement or consent of all the parties to that order. (4) the failure of a court to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the validity of any order made by the court.   the reasons for the final parenting order and the material on which it was based, (b) whether there is any material available that was not available to the court that made the final parenting order, (c) the likelihood that, if the final parenting order is reconsidered, the court will make a new parenting order that affects the operation of the final parenting order in a significant way (whether by varying, discharging or suspending the final parenting order, in whole or in part, or in some other way), (d) any potential benefit, or detriment, to the child that might result from reconsidering the final parenting order.   whether there is any material available that was not available to the court that made the final parenting order, (c) the likelihood that, if the final parenting order is reconsidered, the court will make a new parenting order that affects the operation of the final parenting order in a significant way (whether by varying, discharging or suspending the final parenting order, in whole or in part, or in some other way), (d) any potential benefit, or detriment, to the child that might result from reconsidering the final parenting order.   the likelihood that, if the final parenting order is reconsidered, the court will make a new parenting order that affects the operation of the final parenting order in a significant way (whether by varying, discharging or suspending the final parenting order, in whole or in part, or in some other way), (d) any potential benefit, or detriment, to the child that might result from reconsidering the final parenting order.   any potential benefit, or detriment, to the child that might result from reconsidering the final parenting order.   despite subsection (1), the court may reconsider a final parenting order with the agreement or consent of all the parties to that order. (4) the failure of a court to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the validity of any order made by the court.   the failure of a court to comply with subsection (1) does not affect the validity of any order made by the court.  phasis added and the matters at (2)(a) to (2)(d) are referred to hereafter as ‘the four matters’)
section 65daaa(1)(b) governs section 65daaa  if a final parenting order is in force in relation to a child, a court must not reconsider the final parenting order unless:   ... (b) the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances (and taking into account whether there has been a significant change of circumstances since the final parenting order was made), it is in the best interests of the child for the final parenting order to be reconsidered.
section 15ab use of extrinsic material in the interpretation of an act   subject to subsection (3), in the interpretation of a provision of an act, if any material not forming part of the act is capable of assisting in the ascertainment of the meaning of the provision, consideration may be given to that material: (a) to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the act and the purpose or object underlying the act, or   to confirm that the meaning of the provision is the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the act and the purpose or object underlying the act, or   to determine the meaning of the provision when:  the provision is ambiguous or obscure, or (ii) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the act and the purpose or object underlying the act leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.  ) the ordinary meaning conveyed by the text of the provision taking into account its context in the act and the purpose or object underlying the act leads to a result that is manifestly absurd or is unreasonable.

the explanatory memorandum phasis added and footnote as in the original, see footnote 6 below that reproduces footnote 3 of [97])
the second reading speech .] codifies existing case law about the reconsideration of parenting orders, making it clear that it must be in the best interests of the child, and a significant change in circumstances must have occurred, for an existing parenting order to be reconsidered.

does goode and goode still apply?
... in an interim case that would involve the following:   identifying the competing proposals of the parties, (b) identifying the issues in dispute in the interim hearing, (c) identifying any agreed or uncontested relevant facts, (d) considering the matters in s 60cc that are relevant and, if possible, making findings about them (in interim proceedings there may be little uncontested evidence to enable more than a limited consideration of these matters to take place), (e)-(j) (theses refer to the presumption of the now repealed section 65daa and so no longer apply.   considering the matters in s 60cc that are relevant and, if possible, making findings about them (in interim proceedings there may be little uncontested evidence to enable more than a limited consideration of these matters to take place),
... the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
original proceedings and final orders
11. the child spend additional time with the father as follows:
... for christmas, from 4.00pm on christmas eve until 4.00pm on christmas day in odd years and from 4.00pm on christmas day until 4.00pm on boxing day in even years.

the short form family report in the original proceedings
... during her interview, [ms whitehill] sought for [x] to remain living with her. she suggested that, upon the court determining that it safe to do so, for [x] to spend unsupervised time, and only daytime, with [mr talaska]. she suggested that she had received advice indicating that two (2) hours twice per week was sufficient to maintain their relationship at this age. ... [mr talaska] raised concerns regarding [ms whitehill]’s controlling behaviours over him, particularly in relation to her controlling his time and relationship with [x] both during the relationship and post separation. he cited that [ms whitehill] sought to control aspects of [x]’s life and remove her from the home most days which inhibited his ability to spend meaningful time with her. [ms whitehill] claimed that [x] had been subject to emotional, psychological, and physical abuse by [mr talaska], and exposed to family violence. [ms whitehill] claimed that she had been exposed to emotional, psychological, financial abuse and threats by [mr talaska]. [ms whitehill] claimed that she was expected to work, care for [x], complete household chores and cook meals for [mr talaska], and he did not believe it was appropriate for her to visit friends if he considered there were chores to complete, including preparing meals. she claimed that she had been subject to controlling behaviours, criticism, and denigration by [mr talaska]. ... [ms whitehill] claimed that [mr talaska] experiences serious depression, for which he receives a [government benefit]. she reported that he experiences difficulties controlling his temper, coping with [x] crying, the sounds and sights of [x] eating and spilling food and other basic care routines, such as applying cream to her skin after her bath. ... [mr talaska] described [ms whitehill] as “a kind and caring mother,” however, he suggested that she can be “overanxious” regarding [x], providing examples of [ms whitehill] dictating that he could not take [x] out of the home on his own, even in her stroller down the park. he expressed a wish to be an actively involved parent and for [x] to enjoy positive and loving relationships with both of her parents. during his interview, [mr talaska] reported that he has engaged with a counsellor, [ms f], via phone, which had been organised by his general practitioner (gp), in addition to resuming taking some medication since [x] has been removed from the home. while [mr talaska] readily admitting that both were helpful, he expressed concern for [ms whitehill] potentially “using this against me.” he asserted, “i’m distraught, my daughter is gone,” “my house is empty,” and “i hadn’t missed a night since my daughter was born” until [ms whitehill] removed her from the home [in late] 2022. ... ... [ms whitehill] expressed significant concern for [mr talaska]’s capacity to independently care for [x], claiming that she had only ever left her alone with him on three (3) occasions since her birth, and only for a few hours on each occasion. given the above concerns, rather than seeking independent accommodation nearby as previously planned, [ms whitehill] decided to move to [distant] suburbs with a friend as this is where she had always wished to live and sought an intervention order against [mr talaska]. [ms whitehill] expressed her firm belief that [mr talaska]’s depression and ocd (while admitting that this was not formally diagnosed, however, how he referred to his behaviours) significantly negatively impacted his parenting capacity and tolerance for normal infant behaviours, such as messy eating and crying. ... ...overall, [ms whitehill]’s (potentially raciest) views and attitudes towards [mr talaska]’s (and [x]’s) [country g] culture raised concerns regarding her capacity to actively promote [x]’s relationship with her extended paternal family. ... notwithstanding [ms whitehill]’s general concerns for [mr talaska]’s threats, and lack of parenting capacity, she identified that “he can be a really nice guy,” “that he’s not evil, he’s sick,” and suggested “wouldn’t it be lovely if he could do this [parenting] better.” she asserted that “i will never use her [x] as a pawn,” that she did not intend to inhibit or sever [x]’s relationship with [mr talaska]. further, she acknowledged that [x] transfers readily and happily to [mr talaska]’s care. ... this brief assessment identified no safety concerns for [x] in the care of either of her parents but, rather, found that both parents were more attentive and emotionally attuned to their infant daughter than the average parent. [x] was observed to enjoy a loving and affectionate relationship with both her parents. ... additionally, [ms whitehill] holds concerns regarding [mr talaska]’s mental health, which according to his treating doctor appears to be managed well and that [mr talaska] is compliant with his treatment at this time. ... ...unfortunately, this prevailing negative attitude towards [mr talaska] and his extended family and culture does not bode well regarding [ms whitehill]’s future capacity to promote [x]’s relationship with her father. [ms whitehill] may benefit from engaging in some personal counselling to assist her in managing this issue for the benefit of [x]. [mr talaska] has reported that [ms whitehill] has historically exhibited controlling behaviours towards him and inhibited his ability to be fully involved in [x]’s care. it is hopeful that [ms whitehill] engaging in personal counselling may address some of her anxiety regarding [x] being cared for in a manner which is contrary to her views, wishes or parenting style while [x] is not in her care. ... at this age, [x] would benefit from significant involvement from both parents in all aspects of life. in the event there has been no significant safety concerns raised for [x] in the care of her father, is suggested that from the beginning of 2024 that [x]’s weekend time with her father is amended for her to spend both saturday and sunday with her father each alternate weekend, that [mr talaska]’s restriction of a family member being in ‘substantive attendance’ is lifted and [x] commences transitioning into overnight time with her father for a night each alternate saturday.

the second wave of litigation
the first alternate weekend overnight time
the early 2024 confrontation  talaska] hi [ms whitehill], this morning’s incident was complete unacceptable. i have every right to pick up my daughter without being ambushed by a member of your family. the incident has been reported to police. if you father is present tomorrow morning at drop off [x] and i will not be getting out of the care without police assistance. i will not allow any member of your family to put in danger. i will not be threatened or intimidated by your father again. [ms whitehill] [mr talaska]. i agree that this morning’s incident was highly unacceptable. my dad merely greeted you during handover but you ignored him then subsequently raised your voice and threatened to burst him if he didn’t move away whilst he was trying to say goodbye to his granddaughter. this was really upsetting as you were holding [x] in your arms whilst this was happening.
suburb b police station incident
spend time arrangements cease
hi [mr talaska], i’m feeling extremely unsafe due to your recent behaviour, especially when you threatened a police office in front of [x] and i. i know that our lawyers have been speaking yesterday and until this issue is resolved and a safer handover can be arranged, spend time with [x] cannot occur.
as previously messaged this morning, it’s too unsafe for us to attend given your recent behaviour. my lawyer has advised not attending unless it’s agreed in writing that handovers will occur at a police station from now on. (emphasis added)
hi [mr talaska]. as i’ve still not received written confirmation that the handovers can occur safely at a police station, i’ve been advised by my lawyer not to attend today. can we agree to a handover at [suburb j] police station this weekend?
hi [ms whitehill] i’m at [suburb j] police station as your requested. are you far away?
father attends hospital in early 2024
i was admitted to hospital [in early] 2024 and doctors advised that one of the primary reasons was due to stress which i attribute to her withholding my daughter from me. this is literally killing me. she has used her father as an intimidation tool to get me either in further trouble or assaulted. i am scared she will get anyone else to try and do the above things. i have already filed a police report and statement against her family member for doing this. i have reported the family violence to police at [suburb j] police and [suburb b] station. a child/children has seen, heard, been exposed to or been present at incidents of family violence. incidents of family violence have increased. i am seeking an interim order for immediate protection. (emphasis added[18], grammar and sentencing are unchanged)
proceedings issued and father agrees to changeover at police station.
hi [ms whitehill], i’ve spoken to my lawyers and i feel that for [x]’s best interests i will see you at a police station for handover until this matter is resolved in court.
hi [mr talaska]. thank you for your message but, given your recent hospitalisation and behaviour, i hold significant concerns as to whether or not it is safe for [x] to return to your care at this time. please direct all future correspondence directly through the lawyers until the matter is resolved in court.
early 2024: suburb b police officer asserts not threatened
afternoon, thank you for your patience in waiting for my reply. upon reviewing the date where [ms whitehill] and [mr talaska] attended [suburb b] police station for the purpose of the child handover, i can confirm that there was no actual threat made towards me and that i did not in any way feel threatened. as a result of reviewing this, i can confirm that there is no police investigation int the matter and satisfied that no offence occurred. regards, [police officer’s name] (emphasis added)
