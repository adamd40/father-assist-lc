evidence
the legal principles
...a necessary but temporary measure until all the evidence can be tested, evaluated and weighed at a final hearing by the making of final parenting orders...[6]  0] ... apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
the children’s best interests
safety from harm
“.. has tried to launch a punch on two occasions (holds back arm after arm is up) and then goes and packs his clothes and leaves.” [19]
..in response break down in tears and say words to the effect that “please, i do not want to talk about it. i do not want this recorded. i do not want to get him into trouble.” whilst i had explained to [the mother] the importance of recording her injuries and this information, she was adamant on not wanting to disclose any incidents of violence. out of concern that if probed further, [the mother] would grow more distressed, i would cease my line of enquiry. ... on some occasions, [ms gulek] would evade answering my questions as to how she had sustained these injuries. on a number of occasions, [ms gulek] would attempt to provide explanations as to how the injuries have been sustained. some examples include, that she had fallen or accidentally slammed her hand in the door. whilst i accept these injuries can occur, the explanations that were offered my [ms gulek] did not align with my professional opinion. particularly in light of my studies in [medicine]. at the time, there was no other plausible explanation as to how these injuries were sustained other than trauma.[30] (as original)
the children had been hitting each other and [ms f] was having a conversation with them about why we don't hit our friends and our hands are not for hitting and [x] replied "yes that's right, my dad hit my mum and she called the police" - he did not seem upset at this time, more so he just wanted to be involved in the conversation about why we do not hit.[32]
the children’s views
the developmental, psychological, emotional and cultural needs of the children
as discussed yesterday, as the severity and amount of incidents has increased significantly and we have received multiple complaints from parents of the centre including 2 families leaving our service we will need to work together to ensure the safety of all of our children. we will need to temporarily adjust [x]'s hours of attendance to ensure he has an educator one on one to ensure the safety of the other children.   presented as a bright child with excellent problem-solving skills but exhibited sensory processing issues. i observed [x] to be specifically vigilant to his surroundings including sudden, loud and frequent movements. this led me to the view that [x] would be fine in spaces with fewer individuals but that the behaviours of concern as raised by [ms gulek] and the childcare would be triggered and exacerbated in noisy and busy environments like childcare.[44]
i would take the approach of not judging the behavioural issues but rather try and understand the root cause of any underlying issues and adopting a strategy to remedy the behavioural issues. i adopted the same approach with [x].[47]
the parties’ capacities to meet the children’s needs
the benefit to the children of a relationship with the parties
the boys were very well dressed and seemed in excellent spirits when i arrived and greeted them and [ms gulek]. [mr sidu] and [x] affectionately greeted each other when [mr sidu] arrived, and [x] excitedly showed [mr sidu] the various drawings, and other items that he had brought to share with [mr sidu]. ... at one point, [x] suddenly looked up and said, “dad, i missed you!” ... when [mr sidu] tried to depart, [x] became emotional and repeatedly tried to follow him. it was distressing for both father and son and [x] settled when [ms gulek] arrived and cuddled him.[50]
and on 14 july 2024:   was very happy to see his father and ran to him and they affectionately hugged. ... overall the visit went very well and both children had a lovely time with their father.[51]
he smashed door and hit you mumma an im scared he will hit me or [y].[52] (as per original)
