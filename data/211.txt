the first family report
...overall a competent parent, mindful of the obligations and responsibilities of parenting. she also presents with the ability to provide for [x]’s welfare, development and safety when she is in her care. she has demonstrated commitment to providing for the child’s development. however, as noted above, [ms eccleston]’s reactivity to [mr eccleston] can compromise her capacity to not only support [x]’s relationship with her father, but also compromise her understanding of [x]’s developmental capacity and needs. in according so much weight to [x]’s stories about [mr eccleston], [ms eccleston] is not only emotionally mis attuned to [x]’s need for emotional containment and emotional leadership, she is also allowing [x] to experience anxiety about her mother’s emotional reliability and anxiety about moving between her parents.[14]
...presents as a competent parent, mindful of his parenting obligations. he presents as attuned to the emotional needs of [x] and responsive to her psychological developmental tasks. he demonstrates the capacity, will and motivation as a caregiver to provide for [x]’s development, welfare and safety. while [mr eccleston] acknowledges his ambivalence about parenthood, more than [ms eccleston], he presents as having resolved this conflict and achieved a ‘parenting mind’ where he can be consistently attuned to [x]’s needs for safety and security and support [x]’s relationship with her mother.[17]
while overall [x] is emotionally developing at standard, her exposure to the parents’ conflict following separation particularly, has put her at risk of ongoing anxiety about separation from either parent, anxiety that will compromise her capacity to meet the developmental tasks of learning, socialisation and self-regulation (emphasis added). [x] is at a vulnerable developmental stage where she must acquire the skills of finding emotional protection from stress, managing anxiety and learning to build relationships with people other than her parents. the optimum environment for children to acquire these psychosocial skills when parents have separated is for the caregiving system to be emotionally stable, reliable and supportive of both parents’ relationship with the child.[21]

firstly, the mother described [x] being worried about her when she was in poor health, and described the child as being – wanting to look after her and care for her which is relatively normal and expected, but then the child was also – in a video recording that i saw with mother talking to the child who was in the back seat of the car, the child demonstrated increasingly regressed behaviour in that she started to stumble over her words, and she seemed – seemed to have difficulty choosing words to the extent that she – she stopped talking at the end. so that, for me, indicates a level of anxiety about deciding what to say and how to say it to the mother when the mother asks – poses questions. the other example was when – during the observations, and during the report appointment process for this updated report, the child – when – when the father had arrived in the waiting area – it’s a very large waiting area, and the child was sitting with the grandfather, and the mother and i returned from her individual interview into that waiting area. the child was – was looking like she wanted to run towards the father. she turned to the mother and started to ask anxiously if she could go and talk to her father. and her mother, of course, agreed – not “of course” but did agree, and the child ran absolutely delightedly and – and really quickly towards her father. in the observations for the updated report, the child was asking where the father was, and that indicates to me that the child is aware of – of the absence of the father, and how the mother might respond if she asks questions about the father.[39]
...you could talk about “enmeshed” in terms of emotional fusion, and wanting to please a parent in a – in a somewhat dysfunctional way. the difference between how the child interacted with the father, and the reports of how the child interacts with the mother is that the father followed the child in conversation. he didn’t lead her, and he was able to help her follow through in her play which is exactly what nearly five year old children need in – in parents, whereas i – i didn’t see that as strongly in the observation with the mother. but the reports that i – i have read, and the observation of the videotape indicate to me that the child was – was really trying to find a way to please the mother.[40]   is likely to be attuned to her parents conflictual relationship and if [mr and ms eccleston] do not address this, symptoms of anxiety, story-telling and even aspects of toileting issues are likely to exacerbate, with a negative impact on [x]’s capacity to learn and to play.[45]
counsel for the father: if a child feels like they can’t openly and freely have a relationship with a parent – sorry, i will take it back. using this example, if [x] is living with her mum and feels as though she can’t openly and freely have a relationship with her father, ie, she can’t talk about him in positive terms, or say she wants to spend additional time with him, what type of long-term impact would that have, firstly, on the child’s emotional and psychological health and, second of all, on the relationship with the father? [ms l]: we – we have evidence from our research, your honour, that a child who can feel psychologically, emotionally caught in the middle – which i perceive this child to feel – can find herself having to expend a lot of emotional resources in editing how she might talk about a parent with the other parent, and that – that compromises her capacity to have all of her emotional resources available for learning and for socialisation and for play, and the long-term impact can be very, very negative. counsel for the father: the – the impact on the child of the relationship with the father? [ms l]: not only would the child continue to feel anxious about the mother and the mother’s attitude towards the father, but the child could easily take on some of the attitudes of the mother that the father is not competent, (emphasis added) or that he’s psychologically dangerous in some way or another. and that’s – that’s started to be indicated by some of the stories that [x] has – has been telling a number of people over this last 12 – 12 months/18 months since the first family report, about the father’s inappropriate use of discipline.[46]   ongoing and reliable caregiving time with her father who presents as providing facilitative parenting,[47] (b) x’s happy temperamental disposition which assists her in managing transitions between the parents,[48] (c) a significant protective factor being that the mother and father achieve a more effective cooperative relationship. until the mother can address her attitude towards father and to which ongoing individual psychotherapy would be recommended it is likely that x will experience anxiety and stress in moving between their household.[49]   x’s happy temperamental disposition which assists her in managing transitions between the parents,[48] (c) a significant protective factor being that the mother and father achieve a more effective cooperative relationship. until the mother can address her attitude towards father and to which ongoing individual psychotherapy would be recommended it is likely that x will experience anxiety and stress in moving between their household.[49]   a significant protective factor being that the mother and father achieve a more effective cooperative relationship. until the mother can address her attitude towards father and to which ongoing individual psychotherapy would be recommended it is likely that x will experience anxiety and stress in moving between their household.[49]
the recommendations to see other professionals
ms l’s oral evidence  x’s relationship with the father is strong enough for her to be able to seek support and emotional comfort from him, (b) if there was a change of residence the father has the capacity to be able to provide emotional support and comfort to x, (c) in terms of x’s psychological and emotional well-being going forward and her being able to have a free relationship with both parents, the mother provides the greatest risk to that occurring, and (d) x’s personality would help her cope with a change of residence together with a lot of additional support.   if there was a change of residence the father has the capacity to be able to provide emotional support and comfort to x, (c) in terms of x’s psychological and emotional well-being going forward and her being able to have a free relationship with both parents, the mother provides the greatest risk to that occurring, and (d) x’s personality would help her cope with a change of residence together with a lot of additional support.   in terms of x’s psychological and emotional well-being going forward and her being able to have a free relationship with both parents, the mother provides the greatest risk to that occurring, and (d) x’s personality would help her cope with a change of residence together with a lot of additional support.   x’s personality would help her cope with a change of residence together with a lot of additional support.
a change of residence is never in the best interests of children on one level, your honour. but given the events as they’ve transpired and – and the – and the parenting capacities as i’ve assessed them, i – i think, in many ways, the risk factors do not outweigh the protective factors if a change of residence was determined by the court (emphasis added).[63]
the father
the mother
the mother’s view of x’s relationship with the father
that is having regular holiday time with her dad. i mean, there are four blocks of holiday periods. he’s having her in two of those blocks. he’s having her for a substantial amount of time being six days overnight in a row. it’s only a two-week period for some school holidays, so, you know, he has, essentially, got her for half of that period.[87]
the mother: i’m her primary carer. she wouldn’t be satisfied with that. she’s used to living with me. counsel for the father: that’s not what i asked you. the mother: well, i’m saying no. of course i wouldn’t.‑‑‑i’m her primary carer.[88]
...actions are of concern and indicate at times, her judgement is compromised by what presents as an all-consuming hatred of [mr eccleston]. in the interview for this updated report, [ms eccleston] seemed unaware of the intensity with which she spoke so contemptuously as [mr eccleston] as a parent. such intensity is likely to cloud her parenting judgement, reflected in her coaching behaviour with [x] (emphasis added).[90]   she has “to be mindful responding appropriately to [x’s] concerns, statements, containing her distress, teaching her emotional self-regulation and independent thinking skills and other coping mechanisms, for the previous year”,[94] (b) “i have growing concerns for the safety and well-being of [x] when in the care of her father as a result of developing behaviours statements being made by [x]”,[95] (c) “i have become significantly concerned that [x] is increasingly stating physical discipline by her father or stating the opposite narratives to that described by her father following spending time with him”,[96] (d) “i had always promised myself i would allow [x] to guide me regarding what was right for her in regard to her relationship with the father”,[97] (e) x has been deliberately “exposed to [mr eccleston’s] stress or returned in a distressed state, to attempt to provoke conflict or illicit immediately reactions from me”.[98]   “i have growing concerns for the safety and well-being of [x] when in the care of her father as a result of developing behaviours statements being made by [x]”,[95] (c) “i have become significantly concerned that [x] is increasingly stating physical discipline by her father or stating the opposite narratives to that described by her father following spending time with him”,[96] (d) “i had always promised myself i would allow [x] to guide me regarding what was right for her in regard to her relationship with the father”,[97] (e) x has been deliberately “exposed to [mr eccleston’s] stress or returned in a distressed state, to attempt to provoke conflict or illicit immediately reactions from me”.[98]   “i have become significantly concerned that [x] is increasingly stating physical discipline by her father or stating the opposite narratives to that described by her father following spending time with him”,[96] (d) “i had always promised myself i would allow [x] to guide me regarding what was right for her in regard to her relationship with the father”,[97] (e) x has been deliberately “exposed to [mr eccleston’s] stress or returned in a distressed state, to attempt to provoke conflict or illicit immediately reactions from me”.[98]   “i had always promised myself i would allow [x] to guide me regarding what was right for her in regard to her relationship with the father”,[97] (e) x has been deliberately “exposed to [mr eccleston’s] stress or returned in a distressed state, to attempt to provoke conflict or illicit immediately reactions from me”.[98]   x has been deliberately “exposed to [mr eccleston’s] stress or returned in a distressed state, to attempt to provoke conflict or illicit immediately reactions from me”.[98]   first, “to drag it through court to get rid of the funds from settlement”, (b) second, “to get back at me because i hurt him ... i left him”, and (c) third, “because he does love his daughter. he does want to spend time with her”.[107]   second, “to get back at me because i hurt him ... i left him”, and (c) third, “because he does love his daughter. he does want to spend time with her”.[107]   third, “because he does love his daughter. he does want to spend time with her”.[107]
x’s statements
unfortunately [mr eccleston]’s continued deflection and denial of [x]’s concerns and statements, has contributed to [x]’s anxiety being inadequately addressed due to an inability to allow assessment to take place in the identification of the underlying cause.[110]
the prognosis for this family is poor. there is a significant concern that this family will do poorly if they traverse down the path of litigation. in the midst of such conflict and such intense emotion, it is impossible to conceptualise of how someone of [x]’s age cannot be ill affected. at this stage, there is no likelihood that psychological intervention will be of assistance.[112]
as a nearly 4-year-old child, [x] does not have the cognitive maturity to recall memories that she might have actually experienced as distinct from memories of events she might have observed or heard on television or books. children of this age are known to embellish false memories with considerable detail that presents as plausible.[113]
exhibit f2
what the fuck has society come to? just imagine being attacked and called a bad mother because you won’t enforce your child’s attendance at kindergarten when she’s shitting all over herself and in pain. or because she couldn’t attend kinder after contracting a severe respiratory virus at the [v hospital] because your co-parent .......
mother: what did you just say? [x]: i said my daddy hit me at aunty’s house mother: no but what did you say about being sick [x]: i wasn’t sick mother: you wasn’t sick [x]: my dad was just saying i was sick mother: really [x]: yeah mother: ok
poignantly, in the filmed conversation between [ms eccleston] and [x], the child is clearly attempting to meet her mother’s expectations about what to say about her father. reflective of the level of stress [x] is experiencing is her gradual retreat to silence after stumbling over words and then whispering. [ms eccleston] seems oblivious to this.[128]
legal principles  ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.
a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.
the additional considerations
any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or levels of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant
the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and other persons
the extent to which each of the child’s parents have taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, to spend time with the child, and to communicate with the child

march/april 2021
hi [mr eccleston], thanks for your thoughts. as advised during our discussion on tuesday the 08/09, [x] and i will be relocating early next year, we are no longer able to remain in this area. as recommended, do not relocate based on our circumstances, as you may be disappointed. in relation to your research regarding schooling, unfortunately [x]’s schooling will not be arranged around your personal circumstances, location or preferences. you are however welcome to research suitable and practical options in [x]’s local community. have a great day. [ms eccleston].[153]
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative)
the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family, and if a family violence order applies or has applied to the child or a member of their family, and any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
the primary considerations
the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents
parental responsibility
it appears to us that as a parenting order, including an order for equal shared parental responsibility, must be in the best interests of a child, a court may in the exercise of its discretion find it is inappropriate to make such an order in certain circumstances. this could occur where, although there is no family violence or child abuse, the conflict or lack of effective communication between the parents is such that to properly exercise their equal shared parental responsibility they would be unable to comply with s 65dac by consulting and making a genuine effort to reach agreement about major long-term issues affecting their child or children. in other words, in these circumstances an order for equal shared parental responsibility would inevitably lead to further conflict and perhaps contravention applications, which conflict and/or ongoing litigation could be adverse to the child's best interests.[169]
the act (s.65dac) makes it clear that sharing parental responsibility in respect of "major long-term issues" is not a passive activity, it requires those having equal shared parental responsibility to make joint decisions and to consult and attempt to reach agreement in order to do so. a finding, then, that the parties are utterly incapable of doing so and that there is no reasonable prospect of them doing so in the future, would appear to lead to a conclusion that equal shared parental responsibility is contra-indicated in the best interests of the children and all the more so if it be accepted that high conflict is generally antithetical to the best interests of children.[170]
school
counselling
live with and spend time arrangements
there is no magic in a family report. a judge is not bound to accept it and there should never be any suggestion that the counsellor is usurping the role of the court or that the judge is abdicating his responsibilities.[174]
