[ms sellen], do you complain about that? [ms sellen]: no, your honour. his honour: so what i’m asking you to plead whether you admit or deny: the respondent father sent eight abusive and harassing text message with the below content “no wonder you’re single”. next, “go crawl back into that horrible hole you crawled out of you sick b.... oh, that’s right, you’re obviously already there because only sick, horrible c... take pleasure in cutting off children from their dad”. next, “you horrible c...!!!” with three exclamation marks. next, “you’re a f... sick woman, [ms sellen].” next, “you think that’s a gift. you are a f... c... crawling through dog s...”. next, “you’re a f... wanker”. next, “i detest you and all you stand for”. next, “c...”. do you admit or deny those allegations?

[ms sellen]: yes. his honour: there is affidavit – there is evidence in your affidavit that would corroborate the nine times but the allegation is what’s set out here. okay. i applied a strict rule to his evidence. i’m applying the same to yours. so, [mr treadway], you’re asked to respond to two allegations: the respondent father text two times. first, “every woman i know hates women like you who deny access to the father”. second allegation: “you’re hated in society”. do you admit or deny those two allegations. [mr treadway]: i admit, your honour. admit, your honour. count 7 transcript reference: p-39(34) his honour: number 7, 9 august 2020: the father called the children – it’s said to be the breach of the same orders: the father called the children at 4.37. he also sent 26 text messages with the following content. i’m going to regard – treat that as six, rather than 26, [ms sellen]. [ms sellen]: yes, your honour. his honour: of course, if there are 26 messages in the affidavit, those – that allegation would be alive for the purpose of the welfare of the children’s proceedings. but in terms of what you’re pleading to here, that is now six allegations. do you admit or deny? sorry, i had better read them out: “you’re a f... b..., [ms sellen]”. next, “your parenting is ridiculous”. next, “you need your head read”. next, “you’re f... useless at it”. next, “child access denier”. next, “f... coward, no wonder you’re still single”. do you admit or deny? [mr treadway]: i admit that, your honour. admit. count 8 transcript reference p-40(14) his honour: thank you. number 8: nine text messages – i’m going to amend that to six for the same reason. [ms sellen]: yes, your honour. his honour: 13 july 2020: “you’re a sick woman”. next, “you’re a condescending f... and you’ve taught our children to be like you and [ms c]”. next, “you’ll get yours, [ms sellen]”. next, “have another wine because you’re a drunk”. next, “you need to see a psychologist”. next, “you’re a mental case”. do you admit or deny those allegations? those six allegations. [mr treadway]: i admit those, your honour. count 9 transcript reference p-40(33) his honour: number 9, 31 may 2020: i text the respondent father at 5.42pm asking if he would be calling. the father responded with 18 text messages, however did not call the children. the – i take the allegation – as i understand the allegation, the breach of the order is not in the 18 text messages, but the breach of the order is you didn’t call the children on the day you were meant to call the children, being 31 may 2020 at 5.42pm. [mr treadway]: yes, i admit that. his honour: what do – what do you say? [mr treadway]: i will admit that, your honour. his honour: i’m just going to make a note on this document that what you’re admitting is the not calling. or, [ms sellen], is it – the 18 text messages, are they alleged to be – yes, no. i’m sorry, i have – i’m mistaken there, [ms d], aren’t i? when i read – when i read the part of the order that’s put there, number 5, “harass, abuse, threaten, denigrate”, what i’ve asked [mr treadway] about, what’s alleged to be the “harass, abuse or threaten” is the 18 text messages. and the comment, “however he did not call the children” is really a comment. so what’s – that one is that on that day, that time, you sent 18 text messages. do you admit or deny? [mr treadway]: i will admit that, you honour. count 10 transcript reference p-41(14) his honour: thank you. number 10, 23 april 2020: the respondent father text at 7.28am, which was a thursday, asking to speak to the children. i replied at 10.13am that, “no one wants to”. this was not a court ordered telephone call. now, i’m not asking you to plead to that. that’s just factual background: the father sent a further 14 harassing text messages. do you admit or deny that?

allegations against mother
his honour: so – and i have read [the] affidavit just in case it contains sufficient statements in there that i could find them – i could find that there was evidence at least, [to] call on her to justify her behaviour or hear her side of the story. but i don’t have the evidence so i’m going to dismiss the contravention application filed 5 february 2019. i might add, [ms sellen] and [mr treadway], [ms d], the allegations in there, from my point of view, are still alive in the sense of the general inquiry into the children’s welfare because i don’t take the same technical approach [to that application]. ... ...
