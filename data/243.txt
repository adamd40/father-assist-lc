background
the current proceedings
77. i would be happy for the children to attend a local public school.  ild 1] is a determined and passionate leaner, who thinks deeply and strives to improve in all areas. her compassion for marginalised people is reflected in her strong opinions in class discussions, particularly in religion, and in her advocacy for social justice in the world. for example, recently, she spoke to the class about the unfairness of racism and the importance of cultural inclusion. socially, [child 1] is beginning to develop a greater sense of responsibility for her own words and actions and she is becoming more aware of the perspective of others. she is making conscious efforts to allow others greater opportunities to speak during discussions and is developing marked improvements towards this end. when she supports, adds to, or respectfully disagrees with the opinions of her peers, she shows that she is learning to value their contributions and perspectives. as a learner, [child 1] is increasingly able to reflect on her academic growth, and to formulate personal goals to improve her skills. in maths sessions she participates well, both in small groups and individually, to build her 'number sense' and mental computation skills. [child 1] has shown that she can increasingly use logic when solving problems. she is learning to persist in the face of challenges and to 'have a go' herself, before requesting help, as well as to accept constructive feedback from teachers. this shift towards a 'growth mindset' is having a positive effect on how she sees herself as a learner. [child 1] knows the importance of staying focused during lessons, and this is an area she continues to work on as she sometimes allows herself to become distracted by her own thoughts rather than staying focused on the relevant topic. she is gradually becoming a more independent problem-solver, who is more conscious of the benefits of self-reliance. [child 1] is also developing her awareness of the needs of those around her, and is continuing to work on managing her reactions during conflicts, identifying whether a problem is of 'small', 'medium' or 'large' significance. [child 1], thank you for being such a dynamic member of our class. you really challenge us all to think deeply about so many issues. continue to believe in yourself, respect the opinions of others, and to stand up for what is fair. we know you will continue to work hard in year 5 and beyond. we will miss you! ... [child 2] is a friendly, happy student who has responded enthusiastically to learning throughout the year. he has developed more confidence in his ability as a learner. [child 2] has shown determination and persistence in the areas of reading and number work. there have many moments when [child 2] has been proud to share his accomplishments. when doing so he beams with pride which has been so exciting to see. [child 2] has continued to participate fully in class discussions and contributes on a regular basis. he makes wonderful connections to topics and respectfully offers his opinions to his peers. [child 2] demonstrated enormous patience and resilience when he injured his arm this year. despite this obstacle he continued to work as independently as he could and never once complained. this resilience was also noted during onsite remote learning where [child 2] worked enthusiastically alongside other year 1/2 students and was . always so welcoming to the children from other classes. it has been a pleasure teaching [child 2] this year and i wish him all the best for 2022. ... [child 3] has shown a strong, genuine interest in learning throughout his prep year and has continued to form some strong friendships with his peers. [child 2] is always willing to contribute to whole class discussion and with adult support he is able to remember to respond appropriately by putting his hand up and listening to others by using the whole body listening strategy. during remote learning [child 2] managed well and demonstrated flexibility around having a variety of teachers and varying routines. during this time he continued to grow and demonstrate a passion for writing which was wonderfu1 to see. on the return of his peers in term 4 he has successfully re-established himself into the routine of prep. [child 3] is able to start tasks independently and when reminded he is slowing his writing down to focus on letter formation and writing on the lines correctly and is even starting to edit his work by rereading what he has written. [child 3] can still be reluctant at first to take on teacher feedback though is beginning to be more open to taking on a challenge or explaining his thinking with a positive mindset, this has been evident in both reading and maths groups. [child 3] enjoys working with like minded learners and is able to stay on task for a sustained period of time. when asked [child 3] is often willing to help others and is beginning to show more patience when working with peers who are learning at a different level. [child 3] has continued to widen his friendship circle both in the classroom and on the playground and is seen to be including more of his peers in his game. when faced with conflict or a challenging situation [child 3] can find it challenging to reflect on how his actions can impact others though with adult support he is beginning to do this and move on from these situations in a quicker and more positive manner. [child 3] has continued to demonstrate leadership qualities within our classroom and enjoys taking on extra responsibilities such as our ipad helper, task leader and completing jobs outside the classroom such as taking the lunch orders or office-box. congratulations to [child 3] on a wonderful year and wishing him every success as he continues his education into 2022.
the issues
the applicable law
``... it is important to remember that in australia, whilst the welfare (or best interests) of the child are, by statute, the `paramount' consideration in the exercise of jurisdiction such as was invoked here, they are not the sole consideration. in this respect, the position in this country is different from that in canada [footnote: divorce act, rsc 1985 c 3 (2nd supp), s 16(8).]. it more closely conforms to the language of the convention on the rights of the child [footnote: convention on the rights of the child, art 3.1: `in all actions concerning children, whether undertaken by... courts of law... the best interests of the child shall be a primary consideration.'.] statutory instructions as to the paramountcy that is to be accorded to the child's welfare or best interests are to be understood as they apply to a child living in australian society, normally in relationship with both parents and other members of its family. whilst the legislation considered in this case, and later statutory reforms, give the highest priority to the child's welfare and best interests, that consideration does not expel every other relevant interest from receiving its due weight. in part, this is because (as the english courts recognised long ago) the enjoyment by parents of their freedoms necessarily impinges on the happiness of the child [footnote: poel v poel [1970] 1 wlr 1469, p v p [1970] 3 all er 659.]. but, in part, it is also because legislation such as fla 1975 [family law act 1975 (cth)] and fca 1975 [family court act 1975 (wa)] is enacted to take effect within a society of a particular character whose members enjoy a high measure of personal freedom, diminished only to the extent that the law obliges.''
... in our view, two matters are of relevance here to the differing proposals of the parties. the first relates to the consequences of one parent carrying the predominant burden of meeting the practicalities that flow from their children's schooling. there is no doubt that the parties are seeking to advance the interests of the children in the way each considers will nurture the children's strengths and cater to their needs. we think this is so notwithstanding the suggestion in the family report that additional agendas between the parties may be at work. ... the second point we think relevant to this category of matters to be considered is the undisputed fact that the wife had thoroughly researched schools in the [the locality] area. her selection of [[d school]] was based on those inquiries. the husband conceded that he had not made similar inquiries of [[d school]] and in his affidavit sworn 27 august 1999 said that his knowledge of the school derived from living in the [locality] for 40 years. under cross- examination, he further explained that his view of the school was also based on observing the people who had gone there and speaking ``to different people about their thoughts of [[d school]].''. ... in addition, we think there is considerable substance to arguments on her behalf that weight should be given to the travel commitments associated with the school that the children attend. where a decision must be made by a court in circumstances where parents are unable to agree as between two schools which are prima facie very satisfactory, we see advantages to the children attending a school which is closer to the children's residence. in terms of the practical fulfillment of parenting obligations, it is desirable to enhance the ease with which a parent who assumes the bulk of day to day responsibility can meet the multiple associated demands of children's dependence on a caregiver for transport, participation and security. we do not consider that the fact of a prior agreement between the parties as to [[c school]] carries much weight in the changed circumstances of the family.
section 60ca child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration. ... section 60cc how the court determines what is in the child’s best interests determining child's best interests   subject to subsection (5), in determining what is in the child's best interests, the court must consider the matters set out in subsections (2) and (3).
note: section 68p also limits the effect of this section on a court making decisions under that section about limiting, or not providing, an explanation to a child of an order or injunction that is inconsistent with a family violence order. primary considerations (2) the primary considerations are:   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
note: making these considerations the primary ones is consistent with the objects of this part set out in paragraphs 60b(1)(a) and (b). (2a) in applying the considerations set out in subsection (2), the court is to give greater weight to the consideration set out in paragraph (2)(b). additional considerations (3) additional considerations are:   any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child's views,   the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child's parents, and  ) other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), (c) the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity: (i) to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and   the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity: (i) to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and   to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and  ) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  ) the extent to which each of the child's parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent's obligations to maintain the child, (d) the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:   the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:   either of his or her parents, or  ) any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living, (e) the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis,   the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis,   the capacity of: (i) each of the child's parents, and  ) any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child),
to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs,   the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child's parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant,   if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child:   the child's right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and (ii) the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right, (i) the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, (j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family, (k) if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child's family--any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:  ) the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right, (i) the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, (j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family, (k) if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child's family--any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:   the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, (j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family, (k) if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child's family--any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:   any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family, (k) if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child's family--any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:   if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child's family--any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:   the nature of the order, (ii) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order,  ) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order,   any other relevant matter,   whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child,   any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.
... the combination of the revised explanatory memorandum and the comments of the house of representatives standing committee on legal and constitutional affairs suggests that s 61da(3) provides a discretion not to be exercised in a broad exclusionary manner, but only in circumstances where limited evidence may make the application of the presumption, or its rebuttal, difficult. in this case for example, we respectfully agree with his honour’s decision that this consideration meant it was inappropriate to apply the presumption.
