x’s views
i really don’t know who the fuck you guys think you are redirecting our fucking mail to your house. that is our personal details. now you better have it all fucking ready, every single fucking bit of it, because the cops are coming to look for it. i don’t want to hear from you ever fucking again, because you guys are just fucking pathetic for pulling something like that.
you’re missing out on the bit where he said to ma (being the maternal grandmother) “you are always welcome to see the boys.” but don’t worry about sending the info for christmas day, because i don’t want to come, seeing that you’re hiding [y] from my dad. and my only advice, stop separating what’s left of my family.
i just found out that you’re making shit up about [mr d] threatening you. now you know that is fucking bullshit. the conversation was between me and my brother. you had nothing to do with it, and if you felt so threatened, then you should stay the fuck out of it. first you get my dad charged for nothing. now you’re trying to get my brother charged. who the fuck do you think you are, trying to push yourself into a conversation you were never in? trust me, when we go to court for [y], i will sit in that box and say the truth of who you really are, and i will never forget how you are breaking up the only family i have left. now, don’t ever call me again, delete my number, because all you are is a whole bunch of liars.
