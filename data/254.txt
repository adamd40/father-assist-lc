background facts  in 1980, the father was born and he is, currently, 41 years of age. (b) in 1981, the mother was born and she is, currently, 40 years of age. (c) in 2006, the parties commenced living together. (d) in 2010, the child was born and she is, currently, 11 years of age. (e) in 2012, the parties separated and the father moved out of the parties’ then family home. (f) on 21 august 2012, the parties participated in a conference organised through the ae family centre and entered into a parenting plan. (g) on 4 december 2013, the parties participated in a further conference organised through the ae family centre and entered into a further parenting plan, which provided for the child to live with the mother and spend time with the father each alternate week, from thursday to saturday in week one (1) and from friday to sunday the following week. (h) on 30 november 2016, the parties participated in a further conference organised through the ae family centre and entered into a further parenting plan. there were no significant changes to the amount of time that the child was to spend with each parent. (i) on 23 february 2017, an incident occurred during changeover and the police were called. (j) on 21 march 2017, the mother filed her initiating application with the court. (k) on 28 april 2017, the father filed his response with the court. (l) on 1 may 2017, the court made orders for the appointment of an independent children’s lawyer for the child. (m) on 11 september 2017, the matter was listed for interim hearing. interim consent orders and notations were made by judge sexton for the child to, inter alia, continue to live with the mother and spend time with the father each alternate weekend, from friday to sunday, as well as for the thursday evening in the alternate week and for one (1) half of the school holiday periods. (n) on 2 may 2018, orders were made for the parties and the child to attend a cic. (o) on 30 may 2018, the parties and the child attended the appointment for the cic with ms f. ms f raised concerns about the mother’s ability to contain her fears and emotions about the father, especially, in the presence of the child and the impact that this has had on the child’s relationship with the father. ms f noted that the mother was encouraged to attend therapy and a parenting after separation course and for the child to attend the parenting program m or a similar programme. the child was reported to refer to the father as “grumpy” and, further, reported that he had refused to allow her to call the mother when she was with him. ms f’s assessment did not support the child spending any additional time with the father. (p) on 8 august 2018, orders were made, by consent, for the mother to obtain a referral from her general practitioner for counselling and to keep the independent children’s lawyer and the father’s solicitor informed of her progress. a family report was also ordered, as referred to in paragraph 5, above. (q) on 27 november 2018, the mother’s solicitor provided a letter to the independent children’s lawyer advising that the mother had attended counselling with mr ab, in accordance with the orders made on 8 august 2018 and that he considered there was no further need for the mother to attend future counselling, however, if it was deemed appropriate, the mother voluntarily provided an authority to the independent children’s lawyer to discuss the mother’s progress with mr ab. the mother was not advised by the independent children’s lawyer or by mr ab of any further request to attend. the consultation notes produced under subpoena by the j family practice (being exhibit “3”) recorded that the mother had advised mr ab that she believed continuing with the counselling was no longer necessary and that she was encouraged to re-engage with the counselling if she felt that that was needed in the future. (r) at the end of 2018, the mother made an appointment for the child to attend a one-off appointment with “ms n” at family service o following an allegation that the child had said to her: “i wish i just did not exist”. (s) in december 2018, the father moved into a house with his partner, ms s and her 3 children, ag, born in 2011, currently, aged 10 years, ah, born in 2015, currently, aged 6 years and aj, born in 2016, currently, aged 5 years. those children lived, substantially, in ms s’s care but spent time with their father, mr ak (“mr ak”), as facilitated between ms s and him. ms s was employed as a community worker. (t) on 22 may 2019, the parties and the child attended an appointment with ms e for the purposes of preparing the family report. (u) on 1 june 2019, being the child’s first weekend visit with the father following the family report interviews, the child ran away from the father’s home in the early morning and went to the mother’s home (“the running away incident”). the mother notified the father of the child’s presentation at her home, albeit, as she conceded, not as quickly as she should have. the father then collected the child from the mother’s home later that day and the child then remained with the father for the balance of that weekend. the mother said that she observed the child to not be overly excited to return with the father and, further, that the child did not wave goodbye to her. the father alleged that, after the child returned to his care, she said to him: “it was mum’s plan for me to run away today. she said it would help her keep me [be]cause she’s afraid of losing me to you”. the mother denied this assertion (as she did on 22 july 2019 in terms of exhibit “4”) and maintained that she had been alarmed as the child had crossed a main road to get to her home which, she believed, placed the child at an unacceptable risk. she, further, maintained that she did not say anything of the nature, as alleged by the father, to the child and that the child had later disclosed to her that the father had yelled at her for running away. the father maintained that he had not discussed this incident with the child. (v) on 28 june 2019, the mother alleged that, when she told the child that she had to go to the father’s for the upcoming weekend, the child opened the kitchen drawer, took the handle of a knife which was kept in the top drawer and threatened to hurt herself if she had to go to the father’s house. the mother did not immediately contact the father to inform him of this incident. the mother took the child to her school and spoke to the school principal and said that she requested that he contact the father (see exhibit “e”). the mother, subsequently, took the child to her general practitioner, dr i. the mother conceded that she became teary when describing the incident to dr i. the father later received a telephone call from dr i (see exhibits “f” and “g”) who advised that the child was in his office and had threatened self-harm and asked if it would be “ok” if the child did not spend time with him that weekend. the father was critical that dr i did not initiate any counselling for the child, at that time. the child remained in the mother’s care until the commencement of the school holidays on 6 july 2019. (w) on 6 july 2019, the child commenced spending time with the father for the school holiday period. the father retained the child in his care following her scheduled holiday time with him. thereafter, he initiated seeking a mental health care plan for the child to see a psychologist. (x) on 8 july 2019, the father filed an application in a case seeking urgent interim orders for the child to live with him. (y) on 9 july 2019, the father alleged that he had a conversation with dr i who informed him that the child had said that she was going to get a kitchen knife and demonstrated what to do with it. the consultation notes produced under subpoena by the j family practice recorded that the child did not, herself, disclose threats of self-harm to dr i but rather that these reports were made to him by the mother. (z) on 13 july 2019, the father alleged that text messages were exchanged between himself and the mother regarding the interim orders that provided for the child to be returned to the mother’s care on that date. the father advised the mother via text message that the child would not be returned to her that day. at 7.15pm that day, the police attended upon the father’s residence to conduct a welfare check for the child. (aa) on 16 july 2019, the family report, being exhibit “court 1”, was released to the parties. (bb) on 18 july 2019, the father attended upon a general practitioner, dr p, and obtained a mental health care plan for the child and, subsequently, made an appointment for the child to attend upon a psychologist, dr g, on 22 august 2019. (cc) on 24 july 2019, interim orders were made, by consent and on a “without admissions” basis, that the previous parenting orders, namely, that the child live with the mother and spend time with the father, be suspended and that the child, instead, live with the father and spend supervised time with the mother each tuesday and saturday. (dd) on 30 july 2019, the child spent time with the mother supervised by ms a, the maternal aunt, for the first time. the father alleged that, when the child returned home from that supervised session, she said that she wanted to spend a night with the mother and that the mother wanted her to spend the night with her and asked why she could not live in an equal time arrangement on a week about basis. (ee) on 20 august 2019, a defended interim hearing was conducted before judge altobelli, as he then was. after hearing submissions, his honour’s judgment was reserved. (ff) on 23 august 2019, judge altobelli, as he then was, delivered his interim judgement and interim orders were made, inter alia, as follows: (i) that orders 2 to 10 of the orders made in this court on 11 september 2017 be suspended, (ii) that the child live with the father, and (iii) that the child spend supervised time with the mother each tuesday and saturday.   in 1981, the mother was born and she is, currently, 40 years of age. (c) in 2006, the parties commenced living together. (d) in 2010, the child was born and she is, currently, 11 years of age. (e) in 2012, the parties separated and the father moved out of the parties’ then family home. (f) on 21 august 2012, the parties participated in a conference organised through the ae family centre and entered into a parenting plan. (g) on 4 december 2013, the parties participated in a further conference organised through the ae family centre and entered into a further parenting plan, which provided for the child to live with the mother and spend time with the father each alternate week, from thursday to saturday in week one (1) and from friday to sunday the following week.

expert evidence  the mother alleged that the father was controlling and emotionally abusive towards her throughout the relationship and post their separation. as an example, she said that he would accuse her of saying and doing things that she did not do, including alleging that she attacked him with a knife, that he had called her a: "puny little runt" and that the paternal grandfather had called her an: "uneducated little shit". the mother alleged that the father had physically picked her up and moved her against her will and had forcibly taken the child from her arms when she was breastfeeding the child as a baby. the mother alleged that the father had walked out of their relationship and that she had not heard from him for 6 months. she said that he had cancelled her key card and that she had lost her employment as she had worked for the father's family business. she said that the father had refused to assist with her grocery and electricity bill expenses. (b) the father said that he and the mother, especially towards the end of their relationship, would often engage in back and forth arguments, often about past incidents, which, he believed, the mother could not move on from. the father alleged that the mother had tried to attack him with scissors and that he had retaliated by physically picking her up and moving her. he said that the mother had made derogatory comments about him on facebook and had "alienated" him from the child’s school by making negative comments about him to teachers and other parents. the father said that he had financially supported the mother by moving out of the family home to allow her and the child to remain living there and had paid for her car and additional expenses for the child as they arose. he said that he paid $880.00 per week in child support. he denied that he had left the mother or the child without sufficient money and said that he would not want either one to suffer financial hardship. (c) the parents do not communicate. (d) the mother presented as, significantly, emotional when talking about her relationship with the father and she, frequently, reverted to reported experiences that occurred in the relationship, stating at one point that she was: “living in the past”. (e) the mother believed that the father's alleged demeaning and critical behaviour of her had left her with low self-esteem and that she presented with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (“ptsd”). (f) the mother said that she was unable to communicate with the father, especially “one-on-one” and alleged that the father would behave nastily towards her when he was alone with her. the mother said that seeing the father triggered her to feel the negative feelings that, she said, she had felt when she was in a relationship with him. (g) the mother said that, at the most, she was able to communicate with the father by way of text message, understanding that the child required them to communicate. (h) the mother said that she had completed the ao program but had not completed a parenting after separation course. (i) the mother asserted that she was fearful that the father would take the child away from her and alleged that he had threatened, in the past, to apply for “full custody”. (j) the mother said that, although she had experienced difficulties in adjusting to the parties’ separation, especially noting the impact that this had had on her self-esteem and ability to trust, she was cautious about attending counselling as she feared that this would fuel the father to allege that she was an unfit mother. (k) the father said that he would like to communicate with the mother more positively but acknowledged that they had been unable to do so. (l) the father said that there had been occasions in which he did not handle situations as well as he would have liked and he expressed remorse and guilt for the impact that this had had on the child. as an example, he said, that the argument about the child coming with him on 23 october 2017 (as referred to in (x), below) was, upon reflection, not dealt with well by him. (m) the father, further, said that he had found the ao program and the parenting after separation course helpful and was attempting to communicate with the mother with respect and restraint. (n) the father raised concerns about the mother’s ability to promote the child’s relationship with him and about whether she could distance herself from her “hatred” of him to allow the child to have a relationship with him. (o) the father said that he considered that the child should have an ongoing and significant relationship with the mother and that the child was safe with her. he also said that he did not support taking the child away from the mother. (p) the father said that he did not consider that the mother had mental health issues that impacted on her capacity to parent the child and that he would not allege that she did if she were to engage in therapy to address her stress and emotions from the separation. (q) the father hoped that, were the mother to engage in therapy, therapy would improve the parents’ ability to communicate about the child in the future. (r) the mother believed that limiting the contact that the child had with the parents together had been beneficial for the child. (s) the mother said that she had supported the child in going to spend time with the father by mentioning to the child that her cat lived at the father's home and discussing what activities she and the father would do on the approaching times. in that regard, the mother said that the child had improved in her positivity with spending time with the father but continued to express a reluctance, at times, to spend time with him. (t) the mother gave examples of occasions in which she had misunderstood the parenting arrangement (as, she said, had occurred on the last thursday of term 4, 2017) and when she had experienced difficulties with supporting the child to spend time with the father. in her accounts of these incidences, the mother appeared to have reacted to events with significant emotion and, when talking about these incidences, she was, significantly, emotional, including in her acknowledgment that she feared that she would lose the child permanently and that she felt that she could not, emotionally, face the father. (u) although the mother said that she wanted to protect the child from her strong feelings about the father and from her own fears, there were concerns expressed as to how the mother could manage this, given her presentation at the assessment. (v) the father said that the child appeared positive about spending time with him and that the school holiday week blocks of time have progressed well. (w) the father said that the child would often express reluctance to return to the mother's care or to school at the end of her time with him but that he enforced this as it was an agreed plan that had been reached by the parents that was best for the child. he expressed disappointment that the mother appeared not to take the same approach when the child expressed her reluctance to exchange from the mother's home to his home. (x) the father said that, due to the mother’s reaction to her misunderstanding of the parenting arrangement that had occurred on the last thursday of term 4, 2017, the child was put in a difficult position. the father said that the child had left with him, as planned and without incident. however, he had then received a telephone call from the school principal as he was leaving, requesting that the child be returned. he said that 2 male teachers, subsequently, escorted him and the child to the administration building and spoke to him, in the child’s presence, about how the child should not have been taken outside of the agreed time. the principal then viewed the parenting orders and confirmed that the child was to have dinner with the father. the child, who had been removed from the father’s care by the teachers, was, subsequently, sent back to him without explanation and without an escort. the father said the child was then distressed to go with him and remained unsettled for the duration of the evening. (y) the child presented as a talkative and softly spoken girl. she was, then, in year 2 at the town k public school and said that she: “loves” maths and, generally, enjoyed all her school subjects. she appeared to have some uncertainty concerning her school friends, stating that her 2 best friends included a girl that she had been friends with from kindergarten and her other “best” friend she had become friends with on “monday”. she said that she was not allowed to play with her cousin “ap”, who attended her school, as teachers at the school had told her that she could not play with ap because she was in year 4. (z) the child said that she had a “really close” relationship with the mother and described the mother as very helpful with her school work, good at cooking for her and good at understanding her feelings. she said that the mother “never” got angry but could become “grumpy” when she felt “confused”. the child said that she: “wishe[d] [she] could stay with mummy more”. (aa) the child said that she had been missing the mother when she was with the father. the child said that she had asked the father if she could call the mother when with him but that the father had refused, leaving her feeling upset and sad. (bb) the child said that she loves the father and that she has “kind of fun” when she was in his care. she said that the father was good at looking after her 2 cats, “aq” and “ar”, who lived with him but she criticised his cooking. she said that he could become “grumpy” and would not talk to her for a day. she also said that he argued “lots” with “nanny” and “poppy”, being the paternal grandparents but that this had improved recently as the paternal grandparents were away on holiday for a few months. she said that she did not want to spend more time with the father and that she would like to see the father less often. (cc) the child said that the mother and the father were not friends. she said that she remembered that, once, when she did not want to spend time with the father, the mother and the father had argued about her and the father had carried her away crying. she said that she was “really upset” as the father was “really scary” and “grumpy and really rough” with her, including holding her around the stomach so that she: “could not breathe”. she said that the police were called and that, by the time they came to see her, she had settled and stopped crying.   the father said that he and the mother, especially towards the end of their relationship, would often engage in back and forth arguments, often about past incidents, which, he believed, the mother could not move on from. the father alleged that the mother had tried to attack him with scissors and that he had retaliated by physically picking her up and moving her. he said that the mother had made derogatory comments about him on facebook and had "alienated" him from the child’s school by making negative comments about him to teachers and other parents. the father said that he had financially supported the mother by moving out of the family home to allow her and the child to remain living there and had paid for her car and additional expenses for the child as they arose. he said that he paid $880.00 per week in child support. he denied that he had left the mother or the child without sufficient money and said that he would not want either one to suffer financial hardship.

(y) the child presented as a talkative and softly spoken girl. she was, then, in year 2 at the town k public school and said that she: “loves” maths and, generally, enjoyed all her school subjects. she appeared to have some uncertainty concerning her school friends, stating that her 2 best friends included a girl that she had been friends with from kindergarten and her other “best” friend she had become friends with on “monday”. she said that she was not allowed to play with her cousin “ap”, who attended her school, as teachers at the school had told her that she could not play with ap because she was in year 4. (z) the child said that she had a “really close” relationship with the mother and described the mother as very helpful with her school work, good at cooking for her and good at understanding her feelings. she said that the mother “never” got angry but could become “grumpy” when she felt “confused”. the child said that she: “wishe[d] [she] could stay with mummy more”. (aa) the child said that she had been missing the mother when she was with the father. the child said that she had asked the father if she could call the mother when with him but that the father had refused, leaving her feeling upset and sad. (bb) the child said that she loves the father and that she has “kind of fun” when she was in his care. she said that the father was good at looking after her 2 cats, “aq” and “ar”, who lived with him but she criticised his cooking. she said that he could become “grumpy” and would not talk to her for a day. she also said that he argued “lots” with “nanny” and “poppy”, being the paternal grandparents but that this had improved recently as the paternal grandparents were away on holiday for a few months. she said that she did not want to spend more time with the father and that she would like to see the father less often. (cc) the child said that the mother and the father were not friends. she said that she remembered that, once, when she did not want to spend time with the father, the mother and the father had argued about her and the father had carried her away crying. she said that she was “really upset” as the father was “really scary” and “grumpy and really rough” with her, including holding her around the stomach so that she: “could not breathe”. she said that the police were called and that, by the time they came to see her, she had settled and stopped crying.   the mother presented as, significantly, emotional when talking about her relationship with the father and she, frequently, reverted to reported experiences that occurred in the relationship, stating at one point that she was: “living in the past”. (e) the mother believed that the father's alleged demeaning and critical behaviour of her had left her with low self-esteem and that she presented with symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (“ptsd”). (f) the mother said that she was unable to communicate with the father, especially “one-on-one” and alleged that the father would behave nastily towards her when he was alone with her. the mother said that seeing the father triggered her to feel the negative feelings that, she said, she had felt when she was in a relationship with him. (g) the mother said that, at the most, she was able to communicate with the father by way of text message, understanding that the child required them to communicate. (h) the mother said that she had completed the ao program but had not completed a parenting after separation course. (i) the mother asserted that she was fearful that the father would take the child away from her and alleged that he had threatened, in the past, to apply for “full custody”. (j) the mother said that, although she had experienced difficulties in adjusting to the parties’ separation, especially noting the impact that this had had on her self-esteem and ability to trust, she was cautious about attending counselling as she feared that this would fuel the father to allege that she was an unfit mother. (k) the father said that he would like to communicate with the mother more positively but acknowledged that they had been unable to do so. (l) the father said that there had been occasions in which he did not handle situations as well as he would have liked and he expressed remorse and guilt for the impact that this had had on the child. as an example, he said, that the argument about the child coming with him on 23 october 2017 (as referred to in (x), below) was, upon reflection, not dealt with well by him. (m) the father, further, said that he had found the ao program and the parenting after separation course helpful and was attempting to communicate with the mother with respect and restraint. (n) the father raised concerns about the mother’s ability to promote the child’s relationship with him and about whether she could distance herself from her “hatred” of him to allow the child to have a relationship with him. (o) the father said that he considered that the child should have an ongoing and significant relationship with the mother and that the child was safe with her. he also said that he did not support taking the child away from the mother. (p) the father said that he did not consider that the mother had mental health issues that impacted on her capacity to parent the child and that he would not allege that she did if she were to engage in therapy to address her stress and emotions from the separation. (q) the father hoped that, were the mother to engage in therapy, therapy would improve the parents’ ability to communicate about the child in the future. (r) the mother believed that limiting the contact that the child had with the parents together had been beneficial for the child. (s) the mother said that she had supported the child in going to spend time with the father by mentioning to the child that her cat lived at the father's home and discussing what activities she and the father would do on the approaching times. in that regard, the mother said that the child had improved in her positivity with spending time with the father but continued to express a reluctance, at times, to spend time with him. (t) the mother gave examples of occasions in which she had misunderstood the parenting arrangement (as, she said, had occurred on the last thursday of term 4, 2017) and when she had experienced difficulties with supporting the child to spend time with the father. in her accounts of these incidences, the mother appeared to have reacted to events with significant emotion and, when talking about these incidences, she was, significantly, emotional, including in her acknowledgment that she feared that she would lose the child permanently and that she felt that she could not, emotionally, face the father. (u) although the mother said that she wanted to protect the child from her strong feelings about the father and from her own fears, there were concerns expressed as to how the mother could manage this, given her presentation at the assessment. (v) the father said that the child appeared positive about spending time with him and that the school holiday week blocks of time have progressed well.

(l) the father said that there had been occasions in which he did not handle situations as well as he would have liked and he expressed remorse and guilt for the impact that this had had on the child. as an example, he said, that the argument about the child coming with him on 23 october 2017 (as referred to in (x), below) was, upon reflection, not dealt with well by him. (m) the father, further, said that he had found the ao program and the parenting after separation course helpful and was attempting to communicate with the mother with respect and restraint. (n) the father raised concerns about the mother’s ability to promote the child’s relationship with him and about whether she could distance herself from her “hatred” of him to allow the child to have a relationship with him. (o) the father said that he considered that the child should have an ongoing and significant relationship with the mother and that the child was safe with her. he also said that he did not support taking the child away from the mother.

(t) the mother gave examples of occasions in which she had misunderstood the parenting arrangement (as, she said, had occurred on the last thursday of term 4, 2017) and when she had experienced difficulties with supporting the child to spend time with the father. in her accounts of these incidences, the mother appeared to have reacted to events with significant emotion and, when talking about these incidences, she was, significantly, emotional, including in her acknowledgment that she feared that she would lose the child permanently and that she felt that she could not, emotionally, face the father. (u) although the mother said that she wanted to protect the child from her strong feelings about the father and from her own fears, there were concerns expressed as to how the mother could manage this, given her presentation at the assessment. (v) the father said that the child appeared positive about spending time with him and that the school holiday week blocks of time have progressed well. (w) the father said that the child would often express reluctance to return to the mother's care or to school at the end of her time with him but that he enforced this as it was an agreed plan that had been reached by the parents that was best for the child. he expressed disappointment that the mother appeared not to take the same approach when the child expressed her reluctance to exchange from the mother's home to his home. (x) the father said that, due to the mother’s reaction to her misunderstanding of the parenting arrangement that had occurred on the last thursday of term 4, 2017, the child was put in a difficult position. the father said that the child had left with him, as planned and without incident. however, he had then received a telephone call from the school principal as he was leaving, requesting that the child be returned. he said that 2 male teachers, subsequently, escorted him and the child to the administration building and spoke to him, in the child’s presence, about how the child should not have been taken outside of the agreed time. the principal then viewed the parenting orders and confirmed that the child was to have dinner with the father. the child, who had been removed from the father’s care by the teachers, was, subsequently, sent back to him without explanation and without an escort. the father said the child was then distressed to go with him and remained unsettled for the duration of the evening. (y) the child presented as a talkative and softly spoken girl. she was, then, in year 2 at the town k public school and said that she: “loves” maths and, generally, enjoyed all her school subjects. she appeared to have some uncertainty concerning her school friends, stating that her 2 best friends included a girl that she had been friends with from kindergarten and her other “best” friend she had become friends with on “monday”. she said that she was not allowed to play with her cousin “ap”, who attended her school, as teachers at the school had told her that she could not play with ap because she was in year 4. (z) the child said that she had a “really close” relationship with the mother and described the mother as very helpful with her school work, good at cooking for her and good at understanding her feelings. she said that the mother “never” got angry but could become “grumpy” when she felt “confused”. the child said that she: “wishe[d] [she] could stay with mummy more”.

(cc) the child said that the mother and the father were not friends. she said that she remembered that, once, when she did not want to spend time with the father, the mother and the father had argued about her and the father had carried her away crying. she said that she was “really upset” as the father was “really scary” and “grumpy and really rough” with her, including holding her around the stomach so that she: “could not breathe”. she said that the police were called and that, by the time they came to see her, she had settled and stopped crying.   the mother asserted that she was fearful that the father would take the child away from her and alleged that he had threatened, in the past, to apply for “full custody”. (j) the mother said that, although she had experienced difficulties in adjusting to the parties’ separation, especially noting the impact that this had had on her self-esteem and ability to trust, she was cautious about attending counselling as she feared that this would fuel the father to allege that she was an unfit mother.

(b) the mother was single, living in the former family home in town k. she was employed full-time in the finance sector. (c) the father lived with his partner, ms s, in a home that they owned in town k, together with her 3 children. (d) the child, at the time, attended the town k public school and was, then, in year 3. (e) the child primarily lived with the mother and spent time with the father, in week one (1) from after school friday until before school monday and in week 2 from after school thursday until 7.00pm, with school holiday times equally shared. (f) the mother viewed the father as very critical and demeaning towards her during their relationship and post separation. the father considered that incidents of mutual verbal conflict had characterised their relationship’s decline. he reported that dysfunctional and uncooperative approaches to communication were demonstrated by both parents in the first few years post their separation. (g) the child had, primarily, lived with the mother post-separation. the parties had entered into 3 parenting plans prior to the current proceedings commencing. largely, the child spent time with the father in week one (1) from thursday to saturday and in week 2 from friday until sunday, prior to the interim orders that commenced in september 2017. (h) the issues that characterised the co-parenting relationship related to the ongoing difficulties regarding communication and flexibility concerning the child’s time arrangements. (i) it was identified that both parents had contributed to the sustained insecurities of the co-parenting relationship. however, in more recent years, the father appeared to have had made more positive progress around this. (j) there was an incident at a changeover on 23 february 2017 which both parties provided opposing descriptions about. the mother asserted that the father had roughly handled the child on this occasion and the incident had had a profound emotional impact on the child. the father admitted that he could have managed the situation better, however, denied causing any significant impact to the child. the police files, similarly, reported that they sighted the child shortly after the changeover and she was joking around with police and appeared happy in the father’s care. (k) while the father and ms s had commenced a relationship in 2017, they did not cohabitate until they purchased a property together in december 2018. (l) there were no past or current apprehended domestic violence orders (“advos”) between the parties. there were no significant family violence or abuse risks identified. there were no significant alcohol and substance use risks identified. there were no significant mental health risks identified. (m) child protection have not undertaken any formal assessments of the child’s care and safety needs. (n) the mother sought sole parental responsibility and for the child to continue to live with her and that the, then, current time arrangements for the child remain unchanged. (o) the father sought shared parental responsibility and that the child’s time with him be increased, ideally achieving an equal time arrangement in the future when the child was ready for this to occur. until then, he proposed that the child spend time with him for 3 nights in one (1) week and 2 nights in the alternate week. (p) it was agreed between the parties that the child should continue to spend equal time with each of them during school holiday periods. (q) there was a risk identified with respect to the child’s safety and wellbeing, namely, that her emotional needs would, potentially, be compromised should the mother be unwilling/unable to support the child’s opportunity to continue to develop an independent and healthy relationship with the father, noting the mother’s enduring emotional vulnerabilities about the father and her difficulties protecting the child from them. (r) the mother presented as cooperative in the interview process and no concerns in terms of her capacity to participate were identified. (s) the mother was teary throughout most of the interview and presented with a sustained vulnerability regarding her adjustment to the adult separation and the child’s independent relationship with each parent. (t) the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting. (ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted. (xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   the mother was single, living in the former family home in town k. she was employed full-time in the finance sector. (c) the father lived with his partner, ms s, in a home that they owned in town k, together with her 3 children. (d) the child, at the time, attended the town k public school and was, then, in year 3. (e) the child primarily lived with the mother and spent time with the father, in week one (1) from after school friday until before school monday and in week 2 from after school thursday until 7.00pm, with school holiday times equally shared. (f) the mother viewed the father as very critical and demeaning towards her during their relationship and post separation. the father considered that incidents of mutual verbal conflict had characterised their relationship’s decline. he reported that dysfunctional and uncooperative approaches to communication were demonstrated by both parents in the first few years post their separation. (g) the child had, primarily, lived with the mother post-separation. the parties had entered into 3 parenting plans prior to the current proceedings commencing. largely, the child spent time with the father in week one (1) from thursday to saturday and in week 2 from friday until sunday, prior to the interim orders that commenced in september 2017. (h) the issues that characterised the co-parenting relationship related to the ongoing difficulties regarding communication and flexibility concerning the child’s time arrangements. (i) it was identified that both parents had contributed to the sustained insecurities of the co-parenting relationship. however, in more recent years, the father appeared to have had made more positive progress around this. (j) there was an incident at a changeover on 23 february 2017 which both parties provided opposing descriptions about. the mother asserted that the father had roughly handled the child on this occasion and the incident had had a profound emotional impact on the child. the father admitted that he could have managed the situation better, however, denied causing any significant impact to the child. the police files, similarly, reported that they sighted the child shortly after the changeover and she was joking around with police and appeared happy in the father’s care. (k) while the father and ms s had commenced a relationship in 2017, they did not cohabitate until they purchased a property together in december 2018. (l) there were no past or current apprehended domestic violence orders (“advos”) between the parties. there were no significant family violence or abuse risks identified. there were no significant alcohol and substance use risks identified. there were no significant mental health risks identified. (m) child protection have not undertaken any formal assessments of the child’s care and safety needs.

(cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting. (ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted. (xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   the child, at the time, attended the town k public school and was, then, in year 3. (e) the child primarily lived with the mother and spent time with the father, in week one (1) from after school friday until before school monday and in week 2 from after school thursday until 7.00pm, with school holiday times equally shared. (f) the mother viewed the father as very critical and demeaning towards her during their relationship and post separation. the father considered that incidents of mutual verbal conflict had characterised their relationship’s decline. he reported that dysfunctional and uncooperative approaches to communication were demonstrated by both parents in the first few years post their separation. (g) the child had, primarily, lived with the mother post-separation. the parties had entered into 3 parenting plans prior to the current proceedings commencing. largely, the child spent time with the father in week one (1) from thursday to saturday and in week 2 from friday until sunday, prior to the interim orders that commenced in september 2017. (h) the issues that characterised the co-parenting relationship related to the ongoing difficulties regarding communication and flexibility concerning the child’s time arrangements. (i) it was identified that both parents had contributed to the sustained insecurities of the co-parenting relationship. however, in more recent years, the father appeared to have had made more positive progress around this. (j) there was an incident at a changeover on 23 february 2017 which both parties provided opposing descriptions about. the mother asserted that the father had roughly handled the child on this occasion and the incident had had a profound emotional impact on the child. the father admitted that he could have managed the situation better, however, denied causing any significant impact to the child. the police files, similarly, reported that they sighted the child shortly after the changeover and she was joking around with police and appeared happy in the father’s care. (k) while the father and ms s had commenced a relationship in 2017, they did not cohabitate until they purchased a property together in december 2018. (l) there were no past or current apprehended domestic violence orders (“advos”) between the parties. there were no significant family violence or abuse risks identified. there were no significant alcohol and substance use risks identified. there were no significant mental health risks identified. (m) child protection have not undertaken any formal assessments of the child’s care and safety needs. (n) the mother sought sole parental responsibility and for the child to continue to live with her and that the, then, current time arrangements for the child remain unchanged. (o) the father sought shared parental responsibility and that the child’s time with him be increased, ideally achieving an equal time arrangement in the future when the child was ready for this to occur. until then, he proposed that the child spend time with him for 3 nights in one (1) week and 2 nights in the alternate week. (p) it was agreed between the parties that the child should continue to spend equal time with each of them during school holiday periods. (q) there was a risk identified with respect to the child’s safety and wellbeing, namely, that her emotional needs would, potentially, be compromised should the mother be unwilling/unable to support the child’s opportunity to continue to develop an independent and healthy relationship with the father, noting the mother’s enduring emotional vulnerabilities about the father and her difficulties protecting the child from them. (r) the mother presented as cooperative in the interview process and no concerns in terms of her capacity to participate were identified. (s) the mother was teary throughout most of the interview and presented with a sustained vulnerability regarding her adjustment to the adult separation and the child’s independent relationship with each parent. (t) the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”.

(ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child.

(xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   the mother viewed the father as very critical and demeaning towards her during their relationship and post separation. the father considered that incidents of mutual verbal conflict had characterised their relationship’s decline. he reported that dysfunctional and uncooperative approaches to communication were demonstrated by both parents in the first few years post their separation. (g) the child had, primarily, lived with the mother post-separation. the parties had entered into 3 parenting plans prior to the current proceedings commencing. largely, the child spent time with the father in week one (1) from thursday to saturday and in week 2 from friday until sunday, prior to the interim orders that commenced in september 2017. (h) the issues that characterised the co-parenting relationship related to the ongoing difficulties regarding communication and flexibility concerning the child’s time arrangements. (i) it was identified that both parents had contributed to the sustained insecurities of the co-parenting relationship. however, in more recent years, the father appeared to have had made more positive progress around this. (j) there was an incident at a changeover on 23 february 2017 which both parties provided opposing descriptions about. the mother asserted that the father had roughly handled the child on this occasion and the incident had had a profound emotional impact on the child. the father admitted that he could have managed the situation better, however, denied causing any significant impact to the child. the police files, similarly, reported that they sighted the child shortly after the changeover and she was joking around with police and appeared happy in the father’s care. (k) while the father and ms s had commenced a relationship in 2017, they did not cohabitate until they purchased a property together in december 2018. (l) there were no past or current apprehended domestic violence orders (“advos”) between the parties. there were no significant family violence or abuse risks identified. there were no significant alcohol and substance use risks identified. there were no significant mental health risks identified. (m) child protection have not undertaken any formal assessments of the child’s care and safety needs. (n) the mother sought sole parental responsibility and for the child to continue to live with her and that the, then, current time arrangements for the child remain unchanged. (o) the father sought shared parental responsibility and that the child’s time with him be increased, ideally achieving an equal time arrangement in the future when the child was ready for this to occur. until then, he proposed that the child spend time with him for 3 nights in one (1) week and 2 nights in the alternate week. (p) it was agreed between the parties that the child should continue to spend equal time with each of them during school holiday periods. (q) there was a risk identified with respect to the child’s safety and wellbeing, namely, that her emotional needs would, potentially, be compromised should the mother be unwilling/unable to support the child’s opportunity to continue to develop an independent and healthy relationship with the father, noting the mother’s enduring emotional vulnerabilities about the father and her difficulties protecting the child from them. (r) the mother presented as cooperative in the interview process and no concerns in terms of her capacity to participate were identified. (s) the mother was teary throughout most of the interview and presented with a sustained vulnerability regarding her adjustment to the adult separation and the child’s independent relationship with each parent. (t) the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting.

(aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting. (ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted. (xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   it was identified that both parents had contributed to the sustained insecurities of the co-parenting relationship. however, in more recent years, the father appeared to have had made more positive progress around this. (j) there was an incident at a changeover on 23 february 2017 which both parties provided opposing descriptions about. the mother asserted that the father had roughly handled the child on this occasion and the incident had had a profound emotional impact on the child. the father admitted that he could have managed the situation better, however, denied causing any significant impact to the child. the police files, similarly, reported that they sighted the child shortly after the changeover and she was joking around with police and appeared happy in the father’s care. (k) while the father and ms s had commenced a relationship in 2017, they did not cohabitate until they purchased a property together in december 2018. (l) there were no past or current apprehended domestic violence orders (“advos”) between the parties. there were no significant family violence or abuse risks identified. there were no significant alcohol and substance use risks identified. there were no significant mental health risks identified. (m) child protection have not undertaken any formal assessments of the child’s care and safety needs. (n) the mother sought sole parental responsibility and for the child to continue to live with her and that the, then, current time arrangements for the child remain unchanged. (o) the father sought shared parental responsibility and that the child’s time with him be increased, ideally achieving an equal time arrangement in the future when the child was ready for this to occur. until then, he proposed that the child spend time with him for 3 nights in one (1) week and 2 nights in the alternate week. (p) it was agreed between the parties that the child should continue to spend equal time with each of them during school holiday periods. (q) there was a risk identified with respect to the child’s safety and wellbeing, namely, that her emotional needs would, potentially, be compromised should the mother be unwilling/unable to support the child’s opportunity to continue to develop an independent and healthy relationship with the father, noting the mother’s enduring emotional vulnerabilities about the father and her difficulties protecting the child from them. (r) the mother presented as cooperative in the interview process and no concerns in terms of her capacity to participate were identified. (s) the mother was teary throughout most of the interview and presented with a sustained vulnerability regarding her adjustment to the adult separation and the child’s independent relationship with each parent. (t) the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements.

(p) it was agreed between the parties that the child should continue to spend equal time with each of them during school holiday periods. (q) there was a risk identified with respect to the child’s safety and wellbeing, namely, that her emotional needs would, potentially, be compromised should the mother be unwilling/unable to support the child’s opportunity to continue to develop an independent and healthy relationship with the father, noting the mother’s enduring emotional vulnerabilities about the father and her difficulties protecting the child from them. (r) the mother presented as cooperative in the interview process and no concerns in terms of her capacity to participate were identified. (s) the mother was teary throughout most of the interview and presented with a sustained vulnerability regarding her adjustment to the adult separation and the child’s independent relationship with each parent. (t) the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting. (ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted. (xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   there were no past or current apprehended domestic violence orders (“advos”) between the parties. there were no significant family violence or abuse risks identified. there were no significant alcohol and substance use risks identified. there were no significant mental health risks identified. (m) child protection have not undertaken any formal assessments of the child’s care and safety needs. (n) the mother sought sole parental responsibility and for the child to continue to live with her and that the, then, current time arrangements for the child remain unchanged. (o) the father sought shared parental responsibility and that the child’s time with him be increased, ideally achieving an equal time arrangement in the future when the child was ready for this to occur. until then, he proposed that the child spend time with him for 3 nights in one (1) week and 2 nights in the alternate week.

(ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted. (xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   the mother sought sole parental responsibility and for the child to continue to live with her and that the, then, current time arrangements for the child remain unchanged. (o) the father sought shared parental responsibility and that the child’s time with him be increased, ideally achieving an equal time arrangement in the future when the child was ready for this to occur. until then, he proposed that the child spend time with him for 3 nights in one (1) week and 2 nights in the alternate week. (p) it was agreed between the parties that the child should continue to spend equal time with each of them during school holiday periods. (q) there was a risk identified with respect to the child’s safety and wellbeing, namely, that her emotional needs would, potentially, be compromised should the mother be unwilling/unable to support the child’s opportunity to continue to develop an independent and healthy relationship with the father, noting the mother’s enduring emotional vulnerabilities about the father and her difficulties protecting the child from them. (r) the mother presented as cooperative in the interview process and no concerns in terms of her capacity to participate were identified. (s) the mother was teary throughout most of the interview and presented with a sustained vulnerability regarding her adjustment to the adult separation and the child’s independent relationship with each parent. (t) the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child.

(uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting. (ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted. (xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   there was a risk identified with respect to the child’s safety and wellbeing, namely, that her emotional needs would, potentially, be compromised should the mother be unwilling/unable to support the child’s opportunity to continue to develop an independent and healthy relationship with the father, noting the mother’s enduring emotional vulnerabilities about the father and her difficulties protecting the child from them. (r) the mother presented as cooperative in the interview process and no concerns in terms of her capacity to participate were identified. (s) the mother was teary throughout most of the interview and presented with a sustained vulnerability regarding her adjustment to the adult separation and the child’s independent relationship with each parent. (t) the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”.

(yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   the parties had engaged in couple’s counselling pre-separation. the mother, consequently, progressed to individual counselling after the couple’s counselling concluded. the mother reported that she did not engage in any further therapy until 2018 after the cic identified that she had a poor adjustment to the parties’ separation and that she would likely benefit from engaging in professional therapeutic intervention. the mother engaged in 6 counselling sessions before her psychologist expressed his view that any additional counselling was only required if the mother, herself, felt that this would assist her. she stopped counselling at that time. (u) regarding her insight from her engagement in counselling, the mother reflected that she thought her previous emotional responses: “stemmed down to communication[s] with [the father]...” in this context, she discussed her views of their historical relationship dynamics and asserted that the father was: “not very nice” and that he had a “domineering and arrogant personality”. she reported that, in that regard, the focus of her therapy in 2018 was around strategies for her to: “cope so [she] wouldn’t get caught in a cycle of emotional impacts”. the mother reported that, notwithstanding her engagement in therapy, nothing has changed. she related this solely to the father stating: “he plays mind games a lot. his moods are up and down”. the mother did not identify any of her personal contributions within these dynamics and her tearfulness throughout the interview was indicative of her having sustained emotional vulnerabilities. (v) the mother viewed the father’s parenting of the child as being defined, primarily, by his own needs and what suited him. in that regard, she reported that, pre-separation, the father would take the child from her at any time that suited him, even if the child was feeding or otherwise engaged in an activity with her. she reported that he was “very doting” if other people were present, however, he was “surly” and emotionally manipulative, complaining about the mother’s focus on the child and not on him, if they were home alone. (w) the mother viewed the father as having a self-determined attitude towards parenting which continued post-separation. in that regard, she reported that the father had failed to take the child to a dance performance and birthday parties etc. as these did not suit his personal plans or preferences for the child’s time with him. from her perspective, she saw that this fitted in with his domineering approach to co-parenting, whereby his own needs were prioritised. (x) the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event. (ff) the father believed that the mother was seeking to put “a wedge” between himself and the child rather than to foster their relationship. (gg) the father expressed concern that the mother did not demonstrate any willingness to consider that the child’s report of events may not be correct. he referred to the mother denying that the child had written a note denigrating another child at school, despite her teachers and other children confirming that she had. the father worried about what values this reflected to the child. (hh) the father described the child as a bubbly child who could be playful. (ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting. (ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted.

(ii) the father had some insight into the child experiencing some challenges in adjusting to his re-partnering and cohabitating with ms s and her children, in terms of her going from an only child to one (1) of 4. he was of the view, however, that the children played a lot together and, more often than not, played well and had a positive time together. (jj) the father felt that the child’s more limited time with him contributed to her feeling less included in his family home and that more time with him would strengthen his relationship with her so that she felt valued by him. (kk) ms s was engaging and personable and presented as possessing a mature and child-focused attitude towards co-parenting and as being insightful around the child’s emotional needs and adjustments. (ll) ms s reported that the father and mr ak, the father of her 3 daughters, got along well. (mm) ms s reported that she and the father had taken a proactive approach to blending their families. they recognised that the children would require support to adjust to the changes and they, subsequently, initiated their engagement with a counsellor who was assisting them to support the children’s transitions with a focus on strategies to, primarily, assist in adjusting to their new roles across the sibling dynamics. (nn) ms s was of the view that her relationship with the child remained in the formation stages and, from her position, had been constrained due to the limited times they had spent together and that they had, previously, prioritised the child spending one-on-one time with the father. (oo) ms s supported the father’s position of extending the child’s time with them so that the child would feel more included and part of the father’s new family home. (pp) ms s advised that she supported the father to include the mother in their home, printing out family photographs for the child in her room, which included pictures of the mother and that she encouraged the child to talk freely and confidently about her everyday life, which the child responded, positively, to often talking positively about things that she did with the mother. (qq) the mother reported that while she was, initially, supportive and encouraging about the child’s ongoing time with the father, she had felt frustrated by his approach to communicating with her which she found obstructive and limited. the mother reported that the father dominated their communications and he picked and chose what he would and would not take on board regarding the information she shared with him. (rr) the mother stated that her change in attitude to no longer being appeasing to the father’s demands had characterised the cyclic dysfunction of their co-parenting communication. she found that, largely, co-parenting communication was, consequently, “unproductive”. (ss) while the father stated that the parties’ communication difficulties, largely, stemmed from the mother ruminating about past issues and events and continuing to incite conflict about historical matters, he agreed that, during their relationship, he had been “immature and...probably should have shut up in the arguments rather than fire back and fuel [them]”. (tt) the father, further, reported that both adults yelled and made inappropriate comments to each other in conflict and “were as bad as each other” and that their verbal arguments, during the course of the relationships, subsequently, became verbal text message incidents after their separation. (uu) the father reported that he had experienced the mother to have a high resistance to him in having any opportunity to make independent decisions about the child and maintained that, while he respected the mother in terms of the decisions she made for the child when she was with her, he was of the view that the mother did not have the same respect for his decisions and tried to “control’” the way he parented the child. (vv) the father reported that his relationship with ms s had assisted him to recognise how his approaches and comments had contributed to the poor communication dynamics with the mother and assisted him in approaching their communication differently so that the child was not exposed to the poor adult dynamics. he viewed that ms s’s co-parenting relationship with mr ak set a constructive and healthy example of cooperative co-parenting. (ww) the mother was, somewhat, critical of ms s and reported that ms s had “cut [her] off” when she, initially, introduced herself to her in 2018 and had informed the mother that she did not wish to be involved in the co-parenting communication. the mother reported that claims had, subsequently, been made that she was nasty to one of ms s’s children, which the mother strongly refuted. (xx) ms s, on the other hand, reported that it was the mother who had “cut [her] off” when she stated, at the time they first met: “we don’t associate with people who spend time with [the father]”. on the second occasion of their meeting, ms s reported that the mother asked her to “keep an eye out for the child” when she was with the father. (yy) ms s reported that she would like to get along with the mother and, insightfully, spoke about the benefits associated for children in seeing healthy co-parenting. (zz) ms s reported that the mother and the child would, however, ignore her and her children at school, where both the child and “ag” attended and the child would cast her eyes downward if ms s’s younger children excitedly called out to her, if the mother was present.   the mother stated that, from her own experience, whenever she attempted to discuss with the father comments and conversations from the child about her reservations or reluctance to spend time with him, he would respond with “a tirade of accusations at [her], claiming [she was] poisoning her [the child]”. (y) the child was described as one who thrived being in the outdoors. she loved bugs as well as doing arts and crafts. the child was also described to love music and was then doing music lessons. (z) the mother advised that the child was a, consistently, well-behaved child at school. her teacher described her as being a thoughtful and sensitive child. the mother also experienced these traits at home, noting that the child did not need to be asked to assist with chores as she was self-motivated to assist. the child had received awards at school reflecting her behaviour, efforts and achievements. (aa) the mother did not seek any change to the, then, current time arrangements as she did not see any benefits to the child in increasing her time with the father. the mother reported that the child had informed her that she was unhappy about her experiences with the father, referring to the father becoming frustrated and yelling at her and that she did not like him. the mother said that the child had, reportedly, expressed her negative experiences with the father in her counselling with family service o where she was attending and that the counsellor’s feedback to her was that the child was “finding it very hard to go to her father [as] his moods change a lot [and] she’s also struggling with the 3 girls now being in his house”. the child complained that she was excluded by ms s’s children and that ms s also rarely talked to her. (bb) primarily, the mother wanted the child: “to be listened to”. she wanted the child to know the father but stated that she was “wary of [his] emotional ups and downs... because of how it was for [her]”. (cc) the mother reported that she was motivated to seek sole parental responsibility in response to the communication challenges between the parties and that she remained motivated to consider the father’s views and contributions, as well as to keep him informed and only sought to solely hold decision-making as a means to reduce the issues already demonstrated in their joint communication. (dd) the father was cooperative and engaging at interview. he presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own past poor behaviour and being aware of the responsibilities associated with parenthood. (ee) the father maintained that his capacity to fulfil an active and contributing parenting role to the child was, largely, discouraged by the mother as, he said, she had never allowed him to take the child alone to any of her events, even if that event occurred during his time with the child. he stated that the mother had, previously, told him that he could only take the child to a dance performance when she was unable to do so and that she would re-organise his plans to take the child in those circumstances and, further, she provided him with limited information about the child’s activities, in any event.

(b) both parents were assessed as having demonstrated an ongoing ability and commitment to meeting the child’s daily care needs and issues regarding their practical parenting competency were not, significantly, raised. (c) increasingly, concerns about the child’s emotional security and the quality of her relationship with the father have emerged and it was assessed that this was a key issue. the concurrent adult tensions and non-constructive co-parenting relationship was, similarly, identified as being relevant. (d) the mother presented as being a devoted and committed parent to the child. (e) the mother has a continuing vulnerability, as identified in the cic memorandum and, notwithstanding her engagement in counselling, in terms of her emotional regulation and heightened fears about the father and as to her capacity to protect the child from her own personal feelings about the father. she continued to present as emotional at the interviews and her discussions about the father and the child’s parenting opportunities were indicative of her having a sustained difficulty adjusting to the changes in the adult relationship and dynamics and showed limited progress in her adjustment to the child forming an independent relationship with the father, separate to the mother’s own views about him. (f) of significant concern was the apparent transference of the mother’s attitude and worries about the father to the child and the adoption by the child of the mother’s views as her own and, accordingly, the child’s capacity to enjoy a healthy, positive relationship with both parents was being compromised. (g) the child’s emotional health was also identified as being compromised. the child demonstrated similar patterns of poor adjustment coping skills, to that of the mother. the child’s discussions about feeling excluded in her father’s home also suggested that her adjustment to his family circumstances and changes were challenging for her, notably demonstrating a similar vulnerability to the mother’s while enacting limited coping skills in the context of the father’s circumstances. (h) the mother presented as having a sustained adjustment issue within the adult relationship and this was interfering with her capacity to place the child’s needs before her own in supporting the child to form and enjoy an independent relationship with the father. should this continue, or escalate, the child’s risk of emotional harm will increase substantially. in the short term, this is likely to result in the child seeking to reject the father as a coping strategy to meet the mother’s emotional needs. in the longer term, the child’s sense of security with either parent is likely to be compromised whereby the mother’s maladaptive coping skills were likely to manifest in different ways within the child’s own relationships. in turn, the child’s relationship with the mother was also likely to suffer. in both contexts, the child’s sense of identity will be challenged, her sense of self-worth will be jeopardised and her emotional stability will be compromised. (i) impacts on the child’s psychosocial relationships and capabilities are also likely to occur, should the mother’s behaviour or vulnerabilities intensify or not desist. in this regard, where the child already offered suggestions about not communicating with people who she had “experienced something with”, stating she did not like: “people who are different” and in noting her broader adjustment issues within her blended family, it was identified that the child may have already been adopting the mother’s limited coping skills and approaches. in contrast, the father and ms s’s proactive approach to making changes in their own approaches towards supporting the child’s transition into their blended home, as well as their engagement with a counsellor for professional guidance and support reflected a child-focused and responsible approach towards supporting the child through this adjustment period. (j) the father presented as, largely, taking responsibility for his own contributions to the poor communication and co-parenting relationship between the parties. (k) the child’s accounts also supported that the father did not overtly involve her in the adult matters, nor undermine her relationship with the mother. (l) the available information suggested that the father has demonstrated the practical skills of parenting throughout the child’s life and that he has, proactively, sought to establish a care experience for the child, which recognised her as having a close, loving bond with the mother and having a safe parenting experience in her care. his expressed concerns for the child appeared to be contextualised to his foresight around the child’s capacity to adjust and enjoy a healthy relationship with both parents if the mother was unable to facilitate this for the child. his discussions did not indicate that he possessed persistent, antisocial negative views or opinions about the mother or the qualities of her parenting of the child. in that regard, he appeared to demonstrate a higher capacity and willingness to support and foster the child’s relationships with both parents than the mother did. (m) the child’s adjustment issues in relation to the father’s cohabitation with ms s and her children was not unexpected in the context of a child’s typical adjustment to a parent re-partnering. for the child, her role change from being a single child in both homes to being 1 of 4 in the father’s home was also a significant change. with appropriate support from all 3 adults as well as a sensitive approach to acknowledging the changes this new family structure presented for the child, these circumstances were not assessed as precluding any increase in the child’s time with the father. supporting the child to adapt and adjust to change and to experience changes that characterise relationships are key life skills the child requires to assist her transitioning into adulthood in a healthy way. (n) the child’s best interests would be promoted by being afforded more time with the father than the existing arrangements provided for, so that the child would have more time to directly experience the father’s care of her which would support her to develop a more realistic and informed view about him. (o) noting the mother’s expressed fears that the father would take the child away from her and her sustained emotional vulnerabilities in being able to cope with her anxieties, it was possible that an increase in the child’s time with the father would escalate a sense of insecurity in the mother. the mother’s reaction to a perceived sense of losing the child may intensify her maladaptive approaches in seeking to hold exclusivity in the child’s sense of security and reliance upon her. the mother’s re-engagement with a therapist who has access to this report and the cic memorandum, as well as experience working with separated families is, therefore, assessed as being consistent with the child’s best interests.   both parents were assessed as having demonstrated an ongoing ability and commitment to meeting the child’s daily care needs and issues regarding their practical parenting competency were not, significantly, raised. (c) increasingly, concerns about the child’s emotional security and the quality of her relationship with the father have emerged and it was assessed that this was a key issue. the concurrent adult tensions and non-constructive co-parenting relationship was, similarly, identified as being relevant.

(b) the father was, then, single. he also lived in town k and was employed making health care products. (c) the child was, then, in 2020, attending the town k public school and was in year 4. (d) in accordance with interim orders made on 23 august 2019, the child lived with the father and spent time with the mother, supervised, each tuesday from 3.00pm to 7.00pm and each saturday, typically between 1.30pm to 5.30pm. (e) the mother’s initial position was that she sought that the child be returned to, primarily, live with her and spend time with the father however, during the interview, she shifted to support an arrangement for the child that would minimise any further significant disruptions for her but would still have both parents highly involved in her daily life. the mother stated that: “if [the child][has] established her comfort zone there, i don’t want to take that away from her. but i do dearly love being a mum”. (f) the father’s position was that he sought that the child live with him and spend time with the mother, frequently, moving to an equal time arrangement when the child commenced high school, provided it was then consistent with her best interests. (g) a central issue was the child’s emotional developmental needs and considerations. (h) the mother, while being engaging and cooperative at interview, still presented with a developing capacity to differentiate her own perspective and those of others, notably the child’s. (i) the mother was engaged with a psychologist, ms d, who had also provided her own report in these proceedings. the mother reported that ms d had “reassured” her that she did not have any mental health issues as, reportedly, claimed by the father. she had, however, experienced some “situational depression” in the context of her grief and loss associated with the child’s change in primary caregiver. (j) regarding her understanding of the purpose of the referral to a psychologist, the mother stated that it was: “apparently about a transference of my emotions on the child and also my relationship with [the father] and ways to move forward”. the mother reported that some transference might have presented during the dynamics of the adults at changeovers when the father would: “dominate and say, ‘she’s mine, let’s go’” and then she would get upset and become teary. the mother explained that she was “just one of those people who wears their heart on their sleeve” as a reason for her to respond emotionally to, what she considered, as unpleasant exchanges with the father. the mother also explained that the child had seen the tension between her and the father’s ex-partner, ms s, at school. regarding her own role in this, the mother advised that she avoided conflict and tried to “brush” things like that off. (k) the mother reported that the child has continued to achieve well at school and, to her knowledge, the school held no concerns for her. (l) the mother maintained that, since the orders were made which required her time to be supervised, she was no longer able to frequently volunteer at the child’s school which made her sad about the loss of an opportunity to be involved in the child’s school experiences. (m) the father reported working late on monday, tuesday and wednesday nights when the child would stay with his parents, the paternal grandparents. he would often, on those nights, eat dinner with the child at his parent’s home and the child would sleep there. the father stated that he and the child were home together from thursday to monday. (n) the father’s principal concern was the co-dependent relationship which appeared to have developed between the child and the mother when the child, primarily, lived in her care. he acknowledged that the child had missed the mother and reported that he had validated her feelings of sadness but noted that he had supported her being able to telephone the mother at any time. the father also reported providing to the mother pictures of school events and other things regarding the child. (o) the father reported that, while the child had missed the mother, his relationship with her had strengthened as the child was confident to tell him that she missed the mother and that she was initiating conversations about her life experiences and was talking more readily about her feelings. (p) in that regard, the father reported being worried that the mother still transferred some of her own opinions onto the child in a way that impacted the child. he exampled this with the mother sending him messages saying that the child was scared of her paternal grandfather (reportedly incongruent to the father’s observations of the child’s interactions with her “pop”) and the child, subsequently, returning home from a visit with the mother and telling him that she was: “scared of pop”. enduring impacts still appeared, in the father’s opinion, regarding the child’s exposure to the mother’s negative schema about him. in this way, he reported that if the child was aggrieved because he would not agree to something she wanted or wanted to do, her immediate defence was to complain: “you always do that. you always lie, you always have”. (q) the child who was, then, 10 years and 2 months of age was interviewed. she was unwell with a cold and noting the covid-19 restrictions, her interview took place outdoors, on a park bench by the beach. the child engaged readily and spontaneously throughout the interview and appeared relaxed about the process and no issues of coaching were identified. (r) the child reported that she felt “happy” and safe when in the father’s company and care and that living with him was “okay” but that she missed the mother “a lot”. (s) the child also reported feeling “happy” when in the mother’s company and care. (t) the child gave some background to her running away from the father’s home in june 2019 when she stated that she was missing the mother and wanted to see her. she reported that she had asked the father if she could call the mother and the father had said “no” and raised his voice at her and that she had then gone to sleep and, the next morning, she had gone to see the mother just to say “hello”. she confirmed that the mother had not suggested this to her and that the father had not yelled at her in the way he had since that incident. she, further, reported that she has not had any recurrent feelings or desire to run away from the father’s home again since. (u) the child confirmed that the father did not talk about the mother. she, however, noted that the mother did not talk about the father “really anymore”. (v) the child reported that she wanted to see the mother more. the child said: “two weeks with mum and a week with dad” would be her preferred living arrangement. she also confirmed that she had no worries about telling either parent about this proposal.   the father was, then, single. he also lived in town k and was employed making health care products.

(v) the child reported that she wanted to see the mother more. the child said: “two weeks with mum and a week with dad” would be her preferred living arrangement. she also confirmed that she had no worries about telling either parent about this proposal.   in accordance with interim orders made on 23 august 2019, the child lived with the father and spent time with the mother, supervised, each tuesday from 3.00pm to 7.00pm and each saturday, typically between 1.30pm to 5.30pm. (e) the mother’s initial position was that she sought that the child be returned to, primarily, live with her and spend time with the father however, during the interview, she shifted to support an arrangement for the child that would minimise any further significant disruptions for her but would still have both parents highly involved in her daily life. the mother stated that: “if [the child][has] established her comfort zone there, i don’t want to take that away from her. but i do dearly love being a mum”. (f) the father’s position was that he sought that the child live with him and spend time with the mother, frequently, moving to an equal time arrangement when the child commenced high school, provided it was then consistent with her best interests. (g) a central issue was the child’s emotional developmental needs and considerations. (h) the mother, while being engaging and cooperative at interview, still presented with a developing capacity to differentiate her own perspective and those of others, notably the child’s. (i) the mother was engaged with a psychologist, ms d, who had also provided her own report in these proceedings. the mother reported that ms d had “reassured” her that she did not have any mental health issues as, reportedly, claimed by the father. she had, however, experienced some “situational depression” in the context of her grief and loss associated with the child’s change in primary caregiver. (j) regarding her understanding of the purpose of the referral to a psychologist, the mother stated that it was: “apparently about a transference of my emotions on the child and also my relationship with [the father] and ways to move forward”. the mother reported that some transference might have presented during the dynamics of the adults at changeovers when the father would: “dominate and say, ‘she’s mine, let’s go’” and then she would get upset and become teary. the mother explained that she was “just one of those people who wears their heart on their sleeve” as a reason for her to respond emotionally to, what she considered, as unpleasant exchanges with the father. the mother also explained that the child had seen the tension between her and the father’s ex-partner, ms s, at school. regarding her own role in this, the mother advised that she avoided conflict and tried to “brush” things like that off. (k) the mother reported that the child has continued to achieve well at school and, to her knowledge, the school held no concerns for her. (l) the mother maintained that, since the orders were made which required her time to be supervised, she was no longer able to frequently volunteer at the child’s school which made her sad about the loss of an opportunity to be involved in the child’s school experiences. (m) the father reported working late on monday, tuesday and wednesday nights when the child would stay with his parents, the paternal grandparents. he would often, on those nights, eat dinner with the child at his parent’s home and the child would sleep there. the father stated that he and the child were home together from thursday to monday. (n) the father’s principal concern was the co-dependent relationship which appeared to have developed between the child and the mother when the child, primarily, lived in her care. he acknowledged that the child had missed the mother and reported that he had validated her feelings of sadness but noted that he had supported her being able to telephone the mother at any time. the father also reported providing to the mother pictures of school events and other things regarding the child. (o) the father reported that, while the child had missed the mother, his relationship with her had strengthened as the child was confident to tell him that she missed the mother and that she was initiating conversations about her life experiences and was talking more readily about her feelings. (p) in that regard, the father reported being worried that the mother still transferred some of her own opinions onto the child in a way that impacted the child. he exampled this with the mother sending him messages saying that the child was scared of her paternal grandfather (reportedly incongruent to the father’s observations of the child’s interactions with her “pop”) and the child, subsequently, returning home from a visit with the mother and telling him that she was: “scared of pop”. enduring impacts still appeared, in the father’s opinion, regarding the child’s exposure to the mother’s negative schema about him. in this way, he reported that if the child was aggrieved because he would not agree to something she wanted or wanted to do, her immediate defence was to complain: “you always do that. you always lie, you always have”. (q) the child who was, then, 10 years and 2 months of age was interviewed. she was unwell with a cold and noting the covid-19 restrictions, her interview took place outdoors, on a park bench by the beach. the child engaged readily and spontaneously throughout the interview and appeared relaxed about the process and no issues of coaching were identified. (r) the child reported that she felt “happy” and safe when in the father’s company and care and that living with him was “okay” but that she missed the mother “a lot”. (s) the child also reported feeling “happy” when in the mother’s company and care.

(l) the mother maintained that, since the orders were made which required her time to be supervised, she was no longer able to frequently volunteer at the child’s school which made her sad about the loss of an opportunity to be involved in the child’s school experiences. (m) the father reported working late on monday, tuesday and wednesday nights when the child would stay with his parents, the paternal grandparents. he would often, on those nights, eat dinner with the child at his parent’s home and the child would sleep there. the father stated that he and the child were home together from thursday to monday. (n) the father’s principal concern was the co-dependent relationship which appeared to have developed between the child and the mother when the child, primarily, lived in her care. he acknowledged that the child had missed the mother and reported that he had validated her feelings of sadness but noted that he had supported her being able to telephone the mother at any time. the father also reported providing to the mother pictures of school events and other things regarding the child. (o) the father reported that, while the child had missed the mother, his relationship with her had strengthened as the child was confident to tell him that she missed the mother and that she was initiating conversations about her life experiences and was talking more readily about her feelings. (p) in that regard, the father reported being worried that the mother still transferred some of her own opinions onto the child in a way that impacted the child. he exampled this with the mother sending him messages saying that the child was scared of her paternal grandfather (reportedly incongruent to the father’s observations of the child’s interactions with her “pop”) and the child, subsequently, returning home from a visit with the mother and telling him that she was: “scared of pop”. enduring impacts still appeared, in the father’s opinion, regarding the child’s exposure to the mother’s negative schema about him. in this way, he reported that if the child was aggrieved because he would not agree to something she wanted or wanted to do, her immediate defence was to complain: “you always do that. you always lie, you always have”. (q) the child who was, then, 10 years and 2 months of age was interviewed. she was unwell with a cold and noting the covid-19 restrictions, her interview took place outdoors, on a park bench by the beach. the child engaged readily and spontaneously throughout the interview and appeared relaxed about the process and no issues of coaching were identified. (r) the child reported that she felt “happy” and safe when in the father’s company and care and that living with him was “okay” but that she missed the mother “a lot”. (s) the child also reported feeling “happy” when in the mother’s company and care. (t) the child gave some background to her running away from the father’s home in june 2019 when she stated that she was missing the mother and wanted to see her. she reported that she had asked the father if she could call the mother and the father had said “no” and raised his voice at her and that she had then gone to sleep and, the next morning, she had gone to see the mother just to say “hello”. she confirmed that the mother had not suggested this to her and that the father had not yelled at her in the way he had since that incident. she, further, reported that she has not had any recurrent feelings or desire to run away from the father’s home again since. (u) the child confirmed that the father did not talk about the mother. she, however, noted that the mother did not talk about the father “really anymore”. (v) the child reported that she wanted to see the mother more. the child said: “two weeks with mum and a week with dad” would be her preferred living arrangement. she also confirmed that she had no worries about telling either parent about this proposal.   the mother reported that the child has continued to achieve well at school and, to her knowledge, the school held no concerns for her.

(b) the child’s presentation and engagement was spontaneous and lacked the markers of coaching or views formed separate to her lived experiences, as referred to in paragraph 39, above. (c) the change in the child’s living arrangements following the interim orders made on 23 august 2019 presented as a significant adjustment for her but that she had adjusted very well to that change. (d) there was a demonstrable pattern now established for the father as a capable and competent primary caregiver to the child and that he, notwithstanding his separation from ms s, has the capacity and willingness to prioritise the child’s needs before his own and to afford her with a child-focused parenting experience. (e) the mother has been a highly attentive, engaged and involved parent to the child and the child’s emotional bond with her is congruent with her positive care experience. (f) the child verbally expressed that she was missing her mother and that she wanted more time with her. (g) the child, while living with the mother, had shared a relationship with her that had features of co-dependency and a shared alignment. (h) moving forward, the child’s best interests would be promoted by affording opportunities for her to feel an increased opportunity in time to enjoy her emotional connection with the mother, whilst also maintaining structures within the parenting arrangements that are supportive of the new found integrity and connection between the child and the father which has also given her the opportunity to develop and experience a healthy relationship with both parents. the court accepts that view. (i) the mother’s discussions regarding her views about the most appropriate arrangements for the child moving forward demonstrated a significant shift in her capacity to differentiate herself and the child as individuals in the context of their separate relationships and experiences with the father and her acceptance that the father has been an appropriate and safe parent who has afforded the child emotional stability. this capacity was not evident from the mother in the first family report. however, the mother continued to offer some comments to suggest that she did not yet, fully, appreciate or recognise the transference of her views and worries about the father onto the child and how this had, previously, impacted the child’s personal views of him. the court places significant weight on this assessment. (j) further, the longevity of the mother’s apprehensive views about the father and her comments about ongoing feelings of insecurity with him indicated that there remained some vulnerability in the context of her possible regression in her progress to shelter the child from her own anxieties about the father. (k) for the child, there needed to be a balance between supporting her emotional connection and bond with the mother whilst minimising any interference or undermining of the strengthening bond and security she has now experienced with the father. (l) long-term restrictive arrangements between the child and the mother are likely to undermine the child’s emotional needs and impact her emotional health as she transitions into adolescence. this is also likely to result in the child rejecting arrangements as she ages and self-determines her own arrangements which may, otherwise, be outside of her needs and best interests. (m) the child’s ongoing primary care with the father will maintain her current trajectory in sharing healthy, emotionally fulfilling relationships with both parents. (n) the child, in spending unsupervised, frequent time with the mother will decrease her emotional grief relating to their separation and will also provide her with the balance to continue her lived experiences of positive parenting in the father’s primary care. (o) the parties’ current co-parenting relationship and the vulnerabilities that exist for the child to return to an incongruent alignment against the father do not support, within the foreseeable future, the child living equally in each parent’s care as to be attainable or consistent with her best interests within the foreseeable future.   the child’s presentation and engagement was spontaneous and lacked the markers of coaching or views formed separate to her lived experiences, as referred to in paragraph 39, above. (c) the change in the child’s living arrangements following the interim orders made on 23 august 2019 presented as a significant adjustment for her but that she had adjusted very well to that change.

(j) further, the longevity of the mother’s apprehensive views about the father and her comments about ongoing feelings of insecurity with him indicated that there remained some vulnerability in the context of her possible regression in her progress to shelter the child from her own anxieties about the father. (k) for the child, there needed to be a balance between supporting her emotional connection and bond with the mother whilst minimising any interference or undermining of the strengthening bond and security she has now experienced with the father. (l) long-term restrictive arrangements between the child and the mother are likely to undermine the child’s emotional needs and impact her emotional health as she transitions into adolescence. this is also likely to result in the child rejecting arrangements as she ages and self-determines her own arrangements which may, otherwise, be outside of her needs and best interests. (m) the child’s ongoing primary care with the father will maintain her current trajectory in sharing healthy, emotionally fulfilling relationships with both parents. (n) the child, in spending unsupervised, frequent time with the mother will decrease her emotional grief relating to their separation and will also provide her with the balance to continue her lived experiences of positive parenting in the father’s primary care. (o) the parties’ current co-parenting relationship and the vulnerabilities that exist for the child to return to an incongruent alignment against the father do not support, within the foreseeable future, the child living equally in each parent’s care as to be attainable or consistent with her best interests within the foreseeable future.   the change in the child’s living arrangements following the interim orders made on 23 august 2019 presented as a significant adjustment for her but that she had adjusted very well to that change. (d) there was a demonstrable pattern now established for the father as a capable and competent primary caregiver to the child and that he, notwithstanding his separation from ms s, has the capacity and willingness to prioritise the child’s needs before his own and to afford her with a child-focused parenting experience. (e) the mother has been a highly attentive, engaged and involved parent to the child and the child’s emotional bond with her is congruent with her positive care experience. (f) the child verbally expressed that she was missing her mother and that she wanted more time with her. (g) the child, while living with the mother, had shared a relationship with her that had features of co-dependency and a shared alignment. (h) moving forward, the child’s best interests would be promoted by affording opportunities for her to feel an increased opportunity in time to enjoy her emotional connection with the mother, whilst also maintaining structures within the parenting arrangements that are supportive of the new found integrity and connection between the child and the father which has also given her the opportunity to develop and experience a healthy relationship with both parents. the court accepts that view. (i) the mother’s discussions regarding her views about the most appropriate arrangements for the child moving forward demonstrated a significant shift in her capacity to differentiate herself and the child as individuals in the context of their separate relationships and experiences with the father and her acceptance that the father has been an appropriate and safe parent who has afforded the child emotional stability. this capacity was not evident from the mother in the first family report. however, the mother continued to offer some comments to suggest that she did not yet, fully, appreciate or recognise the transference of her views and worries about the father onto the child and how this had, previously, impacted the child’s personal views of him. the court places significant weight on this assessment.

(d) that the mother held more negative views of the father than the father did of the mother. the court accepts that position in light of the mother’s evidence that she had posted negative comments of the father on facebook, that the father had used the child as a “weapon” against her, that he had put the child through hell and that he was a narcissist who took actions for his own benefit rather than focusing on the child. the court notes the father’s evidence that he had been informed of the facebook posts but that he had no recollection of seeing them, himself. (e) that it was not unusual for a child to report to one parent something and report to the other something different. she, further, noted that, when the child reported to the mother her version of receiving a bump on the head and the father provided a different version to the mother, the mother’s response that the father was lying, as conceded by her, was not conducive to a good parenting relationship and demonstrated a significant lack of trust and was indicative of the use of communication as a defensive mechanism.

(h) there would need to be a significant shift in the parties’ co-parenting relationship, including their communications, so as to not return to their previous patterns for ongoing conflict. (i) that, at present, there was not such a significant shift in the parties’ co-parenting relationship which would justify a change in the child’s living arrangements, noting that the child, apparently, continued to exhibit stress in terms of transitioning between her parents’ households. in that regard, it was reported that the child was resistant to taking her period pack to the mother’s household and the child had reported that the mother had said to her that she was getting fat because the father let her eat too many lollies which was, implicitly, critical of the father’s parenting and which evidenced the mother’s continuing level of angst and which also had the potential for the child to form a negative self-image based on her adoption of the mother’s criticism of the father. the mother denied making such a statement to the child as, she said, she would never say that to a young, pre-adolescent girl. the mother agreed that she had not discussed the child’s period pack with ms d but maintained that, if the child had her period, she would inform the father and that, if the child continued to be in the father’s primary care, she, further, agreed that he needed to know about these matters. (j) that both parties accepted that the child should have a relationship with the other. (k) that it was not unusual for a child engaged with other activities to say to a parent that they did not wish to interrupt those activities to spend time with the other parent.

(e) that it was not unusual for a child to report to one parent something and report to the other something different. she, further, noted that, when the child reported to the mother her version of receiving a bump on the head and the father provided a different version to the mother, the mother’s response that the father was lying, as conceded by her, was not conducive to a good parenting relationship and demonstrated a significant lack of trust and was indicative of the use of communication as a defensive mechanism. (f) that the child had become aware of the mother’s negative views of the father and had adopted some of those, herself. this had the potential for the child to be enmeshed with the mother and to reject the father with the potential for a jeopardised sense of her own identity. (g) that notwithstanding the mother’s engagement with her psychologist, she still presented as having a “developing” capacity in terms of the matters identified in paragraphs 41(h) and 42(i) and (j), above and that her capacity had not developed to the extent which would facilitate the child living with the mother. the further development of that capacity would benefit the child. (h) there would need to be a significant shift in the parties’ co-parenting relationship, including their communications, so as to not return to their previous patterns for ongoing conflict. (i) that, at present, there was not such a significant shift in the parties’ co-parenting relationship which would justify a change in the child’s living arrangements, noting that the child, apparently, continued to exhibit stress in terms of transitioning between her parents’ households. in that regard, it was reported that the child was resistant to taking her period pack to the mother’s household and the child had reported that the mother had said to her that she was getting fat because the father let her eat too many lollies which was, implicitly, critical of the father’s parenting and which evidenced the mother’s continuing level of angst and which also had the potential for the child to form a negative self-image based on her adoption of the mother’s criticism of the father. the mother denied making such a statement to the child as, she said, she would never say that to a young, pre-adolescent girl. the mother agreed that she had not discussed the child’s period pack with ms d but maintained that, if the child had her period, she would inform the father and that, if the child continued to be in the father’s primary care, she, further, agreed that he needed to know about these matters. (j) that both parties accepted that the child should have a relationship with the other. (k) that it was not unusual for a child engaged with other activities to say to a parent that they did not wish to interrupt those activities to spend time with the other parent. (l) that it was not unusual for children to avoid regular telephone communication time with a parent if they were, otherwise, having regular contact with that parent in circumstances where that telephone communication time was perceived by them to be confronting, challenging and stressful. (m) that, if the child was to live with the mother, she should spend substantial and significant time with the father.

parental responsibility
major long-term issues, in relation to a child, means issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about:   the child’s education (both current and future), and (b) the child’s religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child’s health, and (d) the child’s name, and (e) changes to the child’s living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.
to avoid doubt, a decision by a parent of a child to form a relationship with a new partner is not, of itself, a major long term issue in relation to the child. however, the decision will involve a major long term issue if, for example, the relationship with the new partner involves the parent moving to another area and the move will make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with the other parent. [original emphasis]
primary considerations
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
in applying the considerations set out in the subsection (2), the court is to give greater weight to the consideration in paragraph 2(b). see s.60cc(2a) of the act.   approved the interpretation that a “meaningful relationship” as one which is important, significant and valuable to the child (citing mazorski v albright [2007] famca 520, per brown j and mccall v clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 per the full court), (b) concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.
abuse, in relation to a child, means: (a) an assault, including a sexual assault, of the child, or (b) a person (the first person) involving the child in a sexual activity with the first person or another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly, as a sexual object by the first person or the other person, and where there is unequal power in the relationship between the child and the first person, or (c) causing the child to suffer serious psychological harm, including (but not limited to) when that harm is caused by the child being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, or (d) serious neglect of the child. family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful.   an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or (d) repeated derogatory taunts, or (e) intentionally damaging or destroying property, or (f) intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, or (g) unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member’s family, of his or her liberty.   overhearing threats of death or personal injury by a member of the child’s family towards another member of the child’s family, or (b) seeing or hearing an assault of a member of the child’s family by another member of the child’s family, or (c) comforting or providing assistance to a member of the child’s family who has been assaulted by another member of the child’s family, or (d) cleaning up a site after a member of the child’s family has intentionally damaged property of another member of the child’s family, or (e) being present when police or ambulance officers attend an incident involving the assault of a member of the child’s family by another member of the child’s family.   the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(a) is supportive of the position that as much time as possible with both parents is in the child’s best interests. the court accepts that the child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and has been living primarily with the father since august 2019 and spending time with the mother and the child benefits from a relationship with her.

“there are many factors that may go to the weight that should be given to the wishes of the children and these will vary from case to case and it is undesirable and indeed impossible to catalogue or confine them in the manner suggested. ultimately it is a process of intuitive syntheses on the part of any trial judge weighing up all the evidence relevant to the wishes of the children and applying it in a common sense way as one of the factors in the overall assessment of the children’s best interests".  the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child's parents,   and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:  to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  ) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  i) to communicate with the child,   the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child, the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from: (i) either of his or her parents,   or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living, the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, the capacity of: (i) each of the child's parents, to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs  any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs, the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child's parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant. if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child: (i) the child's right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and (ii) the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right,  the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family,  if a family violence order applies, or has applied, (be it final, interim, contested or consented to) to the child or a member of the child’s family-any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:  the nature of the order, (ii) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  ) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  i) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  ) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,   any other relevant matter,  whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
