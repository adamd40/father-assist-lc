stay application
the law
39. some of the matters properly to be taken into account in a case such as the present emerge from what has already been written. to start with, no question arises unless the courts of the respective countries have jurisdiction with respect to the parties and their marriage. and if there is a question as to the jurisdiction of the foreign court, it may be necessary to adjourn the local proceedings to enable the foreign court to determine that question. however, if both have jurisdiction, it will be relevant to consider whether each will recognise the other's orders and decrees. if the orders of the foreign court will not be recognised in australia, that will ordinarily dispose of any suggestion that the local proceedings should not continue. however, if the orders of the foreign court will be recognised in australia, it will be relevant to consider whether any orders may need to be enforced in other countries and, if so, the relative ease with which that can be done. as well, it will be relevant to consider which forum can provide more effectively for complete resolution of the matters involved in the parties' controversy.40. other considerations include the order in which the proceedings were instituted, the stage which they have reached and the costs that have been incurred. it will also be relevant to consider the connection of the parties and their marriage with each of the jurisdictions and to have regard to the issues on which relief might depend in those jurisdictions. moreover, it will be relevant to consider whether, having regard to their resources and their understanding of language, the parties are able to participate in the respective proceedings on an equal footing. the list is not exhaustive. rather, the question whether australia is a clearly inappropriate forum is one that depends on the general circumstances of the case, taking into account the true nature and full extent of the issues involved.
discussion
whether the courts of the respective countries have jurisdiction with respect to the parties and their marriage. no question arises unless this question is answered in the affirmative
whether each will recognise the other's orders and decrees
which forum can provide more effectively for complete resolution of the matters involved in the parties’ controversy
in cases such as the present, where different issues are involved in the local and foreign proceedings, albeit that the different proceedings arise out of the same sub-stratum of fact, the question is not whether the australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum for the litigation of the issues involved in the australian proceedings. rather, the question must be whether, having regard to the controversy as a whole, the australian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the voth sense of those terms, namely, that they are ‘productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment’ or ‘seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging.’[16]
the order in which the proceedings were instituted
the stage which the proceedings have reached
the costs that have been incurred
the connection of the parties and their marriage with each of the jurisdictions and the issues on which relief might depend in those jurisdictions
whether, having regard to their resources and their understanding of language, the parties are able to participate in the respective proceedings on an equal footing
other relevant matters in the general circumstances of the case
if separate proceedings are commenced between husband and wife in different countries, differences in procedure, in available remedies and in the substantive law with respect to marriage and divorce will ordinarily ensure that the proceedings are different in significant respects. however, the proceedings will ordinarily be concerned with the same controversy. and that will be so even if the initiating party is not the same and even if the proceedings seek inconsistent remedies or outcomes. the marital relationship lies at the heart of all proceedings between husband and wife with respect to their marital status especially proceedings for the dissolution of marriage. in such cases, it is the marital relationship itself which is the subject of controversy. and if the marriage is still subsisting, disputes with respect to property, maintenance and the custody of children will ordinarily be but aspects of an underlying controversy with respect to the marital relationship.[33]
we consider that the passages in the judgment in henry ... make it clear enough that there is but one dispute between these parties, that being the marital relationship. that matter, with its various facets, was being litigated in fiji before the husband filed proceedings here.[34]   a conclusion that only one party (the husband) retained any real connection to australia, while the husband maintained a connection with the wife’s country of residence by virtue of the fact that his child lived there and he was seeking parenting and other orders there in response to an application brought by the wife and had thereby submitted to the jurisdiction of the court there in some respects, and (b) the fact that only one aspect of the proceedings between the parties would be resolved by way of the application pending in the australian court.   the fact that only one aspect of the proceedings between the parties would be resolved by way of the application pending in the australian court.
conclusion
anti-suit injunction
if the australian court decides that it is clearly an inappropriate forum, that will be the end of its involvement and the occasion for considering whether to grant an anti-suit injunction or other relief will not arise. [37]
