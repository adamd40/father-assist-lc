reasons for judgment
judge murdoch
introduction
1 at the time of separation in september 2020 the parties and x born in 2013 (“x”) were living in the former matrimonial home in suburb d, victoria. the father now lives at the home of the paternal grandparents in suburb e, victoria.
2 since 10 october 2020 (and subsequent to their release from two weeks quarantine) the mother and x have been living in suburb f, on the region g of new south wales. y born in 2021 (“y”) was born subsequent to the parties’ separation in new south wales.
3 the applicant father seeks an order that the children and the mother be required to relocate back to victoria. the mother seeks orders that she and the children remain living in new south wales. whilst not her proposal, the mother will relocate from new south wales to victoria with the children if the court orders that she do so. the father will not relocate to new south wales if the court determines that it is in the children’s best interests that they remain in new south wales.
4 it is uncontroversial that the children will live with the mother. the father does not, in any circumstance, propose that the children will live with him - the mother is the uncontested resident parent.
5 for the reasons as set out below, the court finds that on balance, the children’s best interests are not promoted by a coercive order requiring the mother, as the uncontested resident parent, to relocate with the children to live in the state of victoria.
the parties’ proposals
6 at the commencement of the trial the applicant father sought orders in accordance with his further amended initiating application filed on 12 november 2021. the father had a single proposal that the children live with the mother in victoria and spend specified time with him. he did not propose an alternate parenting regime in the event the court determined it was in the best interests of the children that they remain living in new south wales.
7 as a result of being asked as to the father’s position in the event it was found to be in the children’s best interests to remain living in new south wales, the court was provided with alternate orders, marked as exhibit f2. the father’s further amending set of proposed orders was marked as exhibit f3.
8 the father’s final proposed set of orders (exhibit f4) was tendered without objection on the last day of the trial and subsequent to the parties’ cross examination. the final version of the orders sought by the father are set out in attachment a. the father seeks an order that the children and the mother live in victoria. there is no further specificity as to location sought.
9 the final orders sought by the mother are set out in attachment b. it is the unequivocal position of the mother that she opposes an order that she and the children live in victoria. the mother’s alternate position with respect to orders she seeks in the event the children and herself are ordered to live in victoria was proffered solely to comply with a direction by the court that she advise the court of the orders she sought in the event the court determines that it is in the children’s best interests that she and the children live in victoria.
the issues
10 the parties agree that: they will have equal shared parental responsibility for the children. the children shall live with the mother irrespective of whether that is in new south wales or victoria. irrespective of what state the children are living in, x will have at least alternate weekend and block school holiday time with the father together with times on special occasions. y’s time with the father will be graduated and at some stage she will spend the same time with the father as x. if the children are living in new south wales the parties agree that both children will spend (once y has the same time regime as x) each alternate weekend with the father from friday afternoon to sunday afternoon. it is further agreed that there will be no mid-week time between the children and the father. whilst the nature of the graduated regime of time y has with the father is not agreed, the parties do agree that y will have day only time until she is 2 years of age and that by the age of 4 years y will have the same regime of time with the father as x. the parties will attend post separation programs as sought by the father. if the children are living in new south wales both parties agree to share equally in the costs of the children’s transport for the time they spend with the father.
11 i raised with each of the parties during the course of final submissions the issue of the allocation of equal shared parental responsibility having regard to the evidence.
12 thus, the issues for the court to consider and determine are:- the allocation of parental responsibility between the parties. whether the children and the mother are to continue living in or new south wales or be ordered to relocate to victoria to live. as an adjunct to the competing proposals as to the state in which the children and the mother reside, the specific time that the children spend with the father in victoria. if the children are living in victoria the father proposes that the children will spend (once y has the same regime as x) alternate weekends with him from thursday afternoon to sunday afternoon. the mother proposes that alternate weekend time shall commence on a friday afternoon and conclude on a sunday afternoon. the father further proposes mid-week time in the alternate week overnight on a thursday. the mother does not propose any mid-week time. the parties disagree as to the terms of the graduating time between y and the father irrespective of where y is living. if the children continue to live in new south wales, the specific arrangements for travel with respect to each of the children including if and when the children travel accompanied by the mother and/or pursuant to the unaccompanied minors program. the mother seeks a specific order that x continue to fly through the unaccompanied minors program with y joining him in the year 2025. the mother proposes that she will accompany y to spend time with the father until the year 2025. the father does not seek any orders with respect to this issue. if the children remain living in new south wales, whether the parties should also equally share in the cost of the mother’s flights to victoria when she is accompanying y for time with the father. the location of changeover of the children between the parties if the children are living in victoria. whether telephone time between the children and the parties occurs “as agreed between the parties” or at specified times. whether x’s surname should be changed from “jameson” to “jameson-mooney.” what specific orders should be made, if any, as to the provision of contact and residential details together with medical and educational information. if the children and the mother are ordered to live in victoria, it is the father’s proposal that he pay the mother’s first rental bond and a sum of $100.00 per week until she either obtains full time employment or y commences primary school, whichever is the earlier.
the evidence
13 the father relied on:- the further amended minute of order marked as exhibit f4, the further amended initiating application of the father filed 12 november 2021, the affidavit of the father filed on 12 november 2021 excluding the annexures, the affidavit of the paternal grandmother, ms h filed 5 july 2021, the affidavit of the father’s work manager, ms j filed 19 november 2021, documents tendered during the course of the hearing marked as exhibit f5, and the case outline filed 19 november 2021.

15 ms m, a family consultant, prepared a report on 9 august 2021, being exhibit 1. ms m was cross-examined on the last day of the hearing.
the children
16 x is 8 years and 3 months of age. he has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. he attends suburb f public school and has a teacher’s aide in the classroom to assist him. x repeated kindergarten. the mother’s evidence is that x is not progressing at the same level as his peers however his writing has improved significantly and he is now able to read some words. it is not disputed that x engages in some challenging behaviours. it was the mother’s unchallenged evidence in cross-examination that x has had issues with biting other people.
17 x is under the care of a paediatrician and psychologist in new south wales. he attends upon his paediatrician approximately every two months, and his speech therapist weekly. he is currently prescribed 30mg of ritalin la and takes one tablet a day. x was approved for ndis funding in september 2021, such funding covers 20 sessions of any therapy. the mother will be responsible for any costs thereafter. x’s speech therapy costs $195.00 per session, his psychologist costs $155.00 per session and his paediatrician appointments are on average $160.00 per appointment.
18 y is currently 13 months of age. she was born subsequent to the parties’ separation in new south wales. y was described by the family report writer as having an appearance not unlike x’s and presenting as “very contented”, the mother describing her as a “very happy baby.”[1] the mother deposes that on 8 july 2021, the mother took y for her six-monthly check-up and was informed by the doctor that she was not gaining weight and would require weekly weigh-ins to monitor her weight. ms m concluded that y “appeared to be developing well, she was responsive to the writer’s efforts to engage her, smiling in response.”[2] the mother meets the costs of y’s paediatrician appointments, the most recent appointment costing $245.00.
the parties
19 the father is currently 29 years of age and resides in suburb e, victoria in the home of the paternal grandparents with his brother, mr n. i accept the evidence of the father and paternal grandmother, ms h, that they are a close knit family.
20 the father is employed as a health care worker for the employer o in victoria, working 5 days a week for 8 hours a day. it is the unchallenged evidence of the father that he has flexibility around his working hours and a capacity to work from home. he earns $89,000.00 per annum.
21 the father deposes that he is in a committed relationship with his partner of almost twelve months, ms p. ms p did not give evidence in the proceedings, nor did she engage in the family report process. there is little evidence as to ms p’s circumstances. she is 27 years of age, is studying a master’s degree in health care and is currently working on a casual basis at the employer q and as a babysitter 3 times a week. she does not have any children. the father deposes that he and ms p are “looking to get married in the future and start a family once her studies are complete.” it is unknown from the father’s evidence whether ms p resides with the father. the father did not explain why ms p did not give evidence in the proceedings nor engage in the family report writing process.
22 there is little detailed evidence as to the family the father has living in victoria save that x appears to have paternal grandparents, a paternal uncle and “extended family” living in that state.
23 the mother is currently 29 years of age. she has not re-partnered. she and the children have resided with her sister, ms l in the home of the maternal grandmother at suburb f on the region g of new south wales since 10 october 2020 after quarantining in new south wales from 25 september 2020. the home has four bedrooms, x and y have their own bedroom. i accept the mother’s evidence that ms l, who is 9 years older than the mother, is a “mother figure” to the mother and assists her in caring for the children on a daily basis as well as financially, she “helps me in any way that i need help.”[3] i accept ms l’s evidence that she looks after the mother, is very protective of her and gives her advice when she needs it. i find that ms l provides fundamental support to the mother in the parenting of the children.
24 the mother’s triplet brothers, mr s, mr t and mr u live in mr u’s home which is approximately a seven minute drive from the mother’s home. the children and the mother generally see them each alternate weekend.
25 the mother has a twin brother, mr v. he and his partner ms w have a son, z who is 3 months younger than y. the mother and children see them several times each week.
26 the mother has family in sydney who she will often stay with when she and the children have a flight departing from sydney. her cousin mr aa and his partner ms bb travel from sydney up to visit the mother and children most weekends.
27 the maternal grandmother has been living in perth, western australia since may 2021 where she has a contract of employment until june 2022. i accept ms l’s evidence that the maternal grandmother’s move out of the home was better for the household and in particular x, as the household is now more settled and routine.
28 the mother does not have any formal qualifications. she is not engaged in paid employment outside the home and is reliant upon government benefits being $450.00 from centrelink one week for the family tax benefit and $880.00 in the second week for the parenting payment single. the mother ‘anticipates’ that her centrelink payments will soon decrease by $80.00 per week, however, there is insufficient evidence to base this belief and i cannot make such a finding.
29 i find that the father pays the mother the sum of $261.35 per week in child support. the mother does not anticipate that she will commence in any form of paid employment until 2025 and at such time it will be limited to school hours. this was not challenged in cross examination by the father and i accept that this will best promote the children’s best interests.
30 it is uncontested that the mother pays to her sister $300.00 each week by way of rent/board but that her sister covers her share if she is short on money. the mother says that “if ever i am short on money ms l will pay for any shortfalls”.[4]
31 the mother commenced taking anti-anxiety medication in september 2021. she has been seeing a psychologist on a fortnightly basis since april 2021. there is no evidence from the mother’s treating psychologist. the father did not make any adverse submissions as to the mother’s mental health issues affecting her parenting capacity ability to care for the children.
32 ms m reports that she is concerned that the parties, appearing as they do to be highly reliant and engaged with their respective family networks, lack the independence and responsibility to grow as parents to their own children. she opines that the parties’ “reliance on their family is undermining the question of where each parent is willing to live.” [5] i accept and find that both parties are reliant upon their families for support. i find that the mother is heavily reliant upon her sister to assist her with care of the children as well as for emotional and financial support.
33 the mother’s affidavit evidence is that the suburb f property is approximately a 58 minute drive from city b airport, a two-hour drive from sydney airport and a 6 hour drive to the victorian border. there is no evidence by the father as to the travel times between the parties’ respective homes. the mother agreed in cross examination that she currently resides a 55 minute drive from city b airport, that the flight to melbourne airport takes approximately 1 and ½ hours and that it is approximately a 35 minute drive from melbourne airport to the father’s home. this is a total travelling time of 3 hours. the mother conceded that including check-in times the total trip would take approximately 4 to 5 hours. it does not appear to be in dispute that it is approximately an 11 hour drive from the mother’s home to the father’s home.
background
34 the father was born in 1992.
35 the mother was born in sydney in 1993. the mother relocated with her family to victoria when she was in year 2. the mother and father attended the same primary school until year 6. upon commencing high school the mother and her family relocated back to new south wales.
36 in 2009/2010 the parties reconnected on facebook and commenced a long distance relationship. in 2011 the mother moved into the father’s home with his parents and brother, mr n.
37 in approximately 2012 the mother learnt she was pregnant. the pregnancy was terminated. events surrounding this are discussed below.
38 the mother commenced studying for her transport licence in approximately 2012.
39 the mother learnt she was pregnant with x in approximately 2013 and ceased studying for her transport licence in 2013. she deposes that she advised the father she did not want to be a stay at home parent, she wanted to return to her studies and ultimately work as a transport worker but the father advised her that he wanted her to be a stay at home mother and not work outside the home. irrespective, the mother did not return to study. i cannot make a positive finding as to why this was.
40 the parties moved into the paternal grandparents’ home in 2013. they paid the sum of $450.00 per week rent.
41 x was born in 2013.
42 the evidence is uncontroversial that the mother was missing her family including the maternal grandmother and the parties agreed the family would relocate to new south wales to live.
43 in january 2014 the parties moved from victoria to a unit at suburb cc on the region g of new south wales owned by the maternal grandmother. the parties paid the sum of $300.00 per week to the maternal grandmother which included the cost of all outgoings.
44 the father commenced working night shift at employer dd. it was unchallenged that he would leave home at approximately 1:00 am and return home from work at approximately 10:00 am. the family would spend some time together prior to the father going to bed to sleep prior to his next shift. i accept the mother’s unchallenged evidence that during this time the maternal grandmother and ms l, the mother’s sister, provided assistance to the mother in caring for x and cleaning the home.
45 in january 2016 the parties relocated back to victoria and lived with the paternal grandparents and the father’s brother, in the home of the paternal grandparents. prior to the move to victoria the parties and x lived with the maternal grandmother in her home for a period of 3 months, although there is no clear evidence as to when this occurred.
46 it is the mother’s affidavit evidence that the parties relocated back to victoria as the father was not happy living in new south wales. she deposes that the father would complain about her family and continually tell her that they had to move back to victoria and that this was “the only thing that was going to make him happy.”[6] the mother deposes that the father would say on an almost daily basis: “i hate it here, it’s too hot.” and “i don’t like nsw”.[7] the mother asserts that she did not want to move away from her family but “i desperately wanted to keep him happy and i thought i had no choice.”[8] the father’s affidavit is silent as to this issue. he is reported as stating to the family report writer that there was a lack of support from the maternal family and they endured financial hardship. on balance, i accept the mother’s evidence in this regard.
47 subsequent to the parties’ relocation back to victoria, x commenced attending day care one day per week.
48 the father commenced working with employer o in 2017.
49 x was diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder in 2019. he repeated kindergarten in that year.
50 the parties moved to the property they had purchased in suburb d, victoria in december 2019. they remained living in this home until separation.
51 the parties married in 2019.
52 x was diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and was prescribed ritalin in 2020.
53 in approximately june 2020, the paternal grandmother moved in with the mother and x so as to assist the mother whilst the father was undergoing two weeks of hotel quarantine. the mother did not feel consulted about the decision for this to occur but said nothing to the paternal grandmother as she did not want to hurt her feelings. this time was extended when victoria went into lockdown due to the pandemic.
54 the parties separated on 11 september 2020.
55 on 25 september 2020 the mother and x flew to sydney and entered two weeks of quarantine due to covid 19 restrictions. the mother was nearly 6 months pregnant with y at this time.
56 on 10 october 2020, the mother and x travelled to the region g of new south wales and began living in the maternal grandmother’s home at suburb f. at this time the maternal grandmother, the mother’s sister ms l and brother mr t were living in the house.
57 on 9 november 2020 the father sent the mother a text message:
you’re really gonna claim 100% care of x so i pay the max amount of child support. $300 a week? honestly? all i wanna do is see him and now not only can i not do that but i have to pay the max amount possible?[9]
58 the mother further asserts that during a telephone call on an unspecified date the father said to the mother “i will do whatever it takes to have you brought back here, i can’t believe you expect me to pay you this amount of child support. it's not going to happen.” the father did not put this conversation into issue.
59 on 11 november 2020 the father filed an initiating application seeking orders on an interim basis that x and the mother immediately return to the victoria and be restrained from relocating outside of that state, a recovery order for x to be delivered to him at his residence in victoria, that the parties have equal shared parental responsibility for x, and that x live with the parties on a week about basis.

(2) the child spend time and communicate with the father as follows: (a) from saturday 5 december 2020 with the child to fly to melbourne and the mother to travel with the child to wednesday 9 december 2020 with the child to fly back to new south wales with the mother, at the expense of the mother, (b) from wednesday 23 december 2020 with the child to fly to melbourne and the father to collect the child to thursday 31 december 2020 with the child to fly back to new south wales through the unaccompanied minors program through qantas or another airline agreed between the parties, at the joint expense of the parties, (c) from friday evening with the child to fly to melbourne on a 5pm-6pm flight (or during the school term on saturday morning if friday departure is not possible) and the mother to travel with the child to sunday afternoon/evening with the child to fly back to new south wales on a 5pm-6pm flight and the mother to travel with the child, commencing friday 9 january 2021 and each alternate weekend thereafter at the joint expense of the parties, (d) by telephone/facetime each day, (e) such other and further times as agreed between the parties.

and the court notes that:
61 from 5 december 2020 to 9 december 2020 the father spent time with x in melbourne with the mother accompanying x’s travel.
62 in 2020 x was due to travel to victoria. due to covid 19 restrictions, all flights to melbourne from city b airport were cancelled. as flights were $809 each way the father requested the mother drive with the parties to meet at the new south wales/victorian border, a 6 hour drive. the mother was 8 ½ months pregnant at the time. the child did not spend time with the father on this occasion.
63 in 2021 y was born.
64 the father spent time with x from 2021 to 2021 with the father travelling to new south wales to collect x with changeover occurring at city b airport. in evidence are numerous email communications between the parties attempting to arrange for y to see the father at this time. the mother deposes that on 18 january 2021 the father confirmed with the mother by email that x’s flight was scheduled at 5:50 pm and requested the mother arrive early so that he could spend time with y, who was almost 2 weeks old at this time. by email, the mother asked the father whether he had his whooping cough vaccination. the father responded that he had received the vaccination that day and asked “to see proof from your entire family with written doctors notes that they have all received vaccinations. you are not the only one that can make these demands. so i’ll be expecting doctors notes from ms mooney, mr u, mr s, mr v, ms l, ms w and yourself tonight. you can send all these through my lawyer if you like. thanks.”[10]
65 the father sent an email at 6:45 pm on the same day as follows:
are you telling me you won’t allow me to meet my daughter for the first time? i’d like to see all those doctors notes from your family members right now if this is the case. otherwise as i said, i’ll see you and y at the airport tomorrow. as i said, if you are unable to provide this on your end by tomorrow, it will look very hypocritical and will discredit your logic in me not seeing my daughter. and this will therefore be classified as parental alienation, and will not be a good look for court for you. bottom line, unless you can provide those notes by tomorrow back dated to 2 weeks ago, i’ll see y tomorrow. you opened this can of worms, not me. it’s clear you are not able to provide these and it would therefore be easier to allow me to see y. i’m more than happy to wear a mask while holding her to avoid any potential risk that you’re perceiving. regardless of this, i’ll expect until you provide me with documented proof of you and your whole family receiving this more than 2 weeks ago, your family will wear masks if they are around her too. again, you opened this can of worms. this whole email is in line with legal advice i’ve received on the matter. thanks
66 the mother advised the father by email at 10:02 pm that night that:
keeping y away from you is definitely not something i would ever do. you are more than welcome to come to our house to see her. the airport is not a safe place for an unimmunised newborn, especially with covid.[11]
67 the father responded:-
if that’s the case and the way you want to do it, fine. i’ll see you and her in melbourne on the 5th february. me and all my family members will have had the injection and past the phase where it will have kicked in, and you’ll then have no excuse not to follow the court order. i will book flights for that later this week. thanks
68 there were no court orders in place with respect to time y was to spend with the father.
69 the father sent the mother an email the next morning at 5:45 am as follows:
i don’t think saying y is not safe at an airport is quite silly and just not true. also you know full well i’m not allowed to leave the airport. regardless you’ll be bringing her down on the 5th which will involve an airport so. anyway whatever you decide in regards to potentially keeping me from meeting her will obviously be noted and documented for court.[12]
70 the mother deposes that on 25 january 2021, the mother emailed the father asking what time he would like to meet at city b airport to facilitate changeover as the mother offered to arrive early so the father could spend time with y. the father reported by email that “i’ve changed my flight time to 8:30am, as last time i had to sit at the airport for 9 hours and you didn’t want to come any earlier so i was by myself the whole time and couldn’t spend any extra time with y.”[13] the father’s evidence is that he saw y briefly on this occasion for less than a minute while she was strapped into the mother’s car.
71 x spent time with the father on the weekend commencing 5 february 2021 in victoria. x was accompanied by the maternal grandmother.
72 the parties then began communicating as to arrangements for the children in the next school holidays. the mother advised the father that she has planned a trip to queensland with the children. in an email to the mother dated 16 february 2021 the father states to the mother with respect to school holidays:
why would you do that, and prior to court as well?? why? you realise it’s very standard practice no matter what the custody arrangements are in place, for parents to split school holidays? the courts will put this into an order prior to the holidays, so if you’ve made ‘plans’ suddenly out of thin air, i’d suggest you cancel them now, as making them was very irresponsible and naïve of you.......wow. yet another attempt at parental alienation. i now have cited three instances within a few days, all forwarded to my legal team. all this will be brought to light at court i’ve been told, i can promise you that........i promise you right now, i have no problem dragging this through 150k + each in legal fees (and i will) if that’s what it takes, to ensure my son and daughter get what they deserve, and that’s to spend the most amount of time with their loving father as possible, despite what you think. i will fight this for years and years if i have to, and you know i will, in order to do what’s right by my son and daughter, even if you aren’t......very disappointing ms mooney.
73 x spent time with the father from 19 february 2021 to 21 february 2021. the maternal grandmother again travelled with x to melbourne airport to facilitate x’s time with the father. there was an issue with respect to the handover of x by the maternal grandmother to the father.
74 during the time that x was spending time with the father, he sent the mother an email on 19 february 2021 as follows:
as you know, the fact i allow your mother to bring x down is a favour i do, as technically as per the court order you are to bring x down. it was as you know a jetstar flight, i was in the jetstar pick up zone as i had arranged with your mother the fortnight before. makes sense right? jetstar flight, jetstar waiting bay. virgin flight, virgin waiting bay. apparently that was too hard to grasp. she waited in the wrong spot and sat there doing nothing for 35 minutes, until i had to call her. i mean really? when i got there, she then gave me a terrible attitude and was rude to me in front of x. she then told me i had to be in the virgin car park at 1:50pm on sunday. i told her that i would drop him at the jetstar waiting bay as it is closer for x, and as i said it's a jetstar flight, makes sense right? she then said, "well i'll be in the virgin one", i said well what if he misses his flight? she shrugged her shoulders and walked off. if she isn't at the jetstar drop off point at 1:50pm and goes downstairs, and x in turn misses his flight. he will then either have to stay here for an extended time, and the replacement flight will be entirely at your cost, as it will be all your mother's fault. in future she is not to bring him down. you can just follow the court order now. i agreed to do you the favour of allowing her to come instead of you, and she's ruined it for you with her tardiness and disgusting attitude, and in front of x no less. you can thank her for that. thanks
75 on the 6 march 2021 the mother took y for the first time to melbourne with x to visit the father. she travelled with her friend mr k. this was the first time that the mother was travelling with both x and y on an aeroplane. y was 2 months old. there is an incident at the changeover of x between the parties at the airport.
76 an issue then arose between the parties as to x travelling to melbourne airport on a friday afternoon. on thursday 11 march 2021, the solicitors for the mother forwarded an email to the solicitors for the father advising that the mother was unable to travel to city b airport on a friday afternoon with sufficient time to board the 5:10 pm flight after x finished school due to peak hour traffic and the lengthy check in process with a newborn child. it stated that x would commence travelling to melbourne on a saturday morning flight instead.
77 the father’s solicitors stated by return email that the 5:10pm flight was possible as the parties have booked the flight to success in the past. notwithstanding, the father solicitors suggested that the children should travel on the 8:20 pm flight on friday instead and that “a newborn baby does not know the difference better (between) day and night, and generally sleeps in small cycles.” it continued:-
in the event that your client does not comply with the current interim orders, we are instructed to issue an urgent application in a case seeking immediate relocation and recovery of x to victoria.[14]
78 some 3 minutes later on this date, the solicitors for the father forwarded a further email to the solicitors for the mother seeking clarification as to whether the mother was departing on a 5:10pm or 8:20 pm flight.
79 by way of letter dated 12 march 2021, the mother’s solicitors wrote to the father’s solicitors again advising that time will commence on the saturday noting that:-
our client is astonished that your client would propose that x and y travel to melbourne on the 8.20pm flight. regardless that such flight would see x not arrive and be settled at your client's residence until likely after 11 pm (that is in the unlikely event our client would be able to secure a rental car), our client and y would be stranded at melbourne airport given there are no returning flights to city b until the next day.[15]
80 by way of letter dated 14 march 2021, the father’s solicitors wrote to the mother’s solicitors attaching copies of 2 flight booking confirmations, the first being a 2:35 pm departure on friday 5 february 2021 and the other a 5:10 pm departure on friday 19 february 2021. it stated that “it is clearly possible for x to make the 5:10pm departure flight from city b.”[16] the solicitors for the father again advise the mother that they hold instructions to file an application for recovery:-
accordingly, our client reiterates his position detailed in our emails dated 11 march 2021, and in the event your client refuses to make the 5: 10pm departure flight from city b we are instructed to issue an app1ication in a case for immediate relocation and recovery with an application for costs against your client on an indemnity basis.[17]
81 by way of letter dated 15 march 2021, the mother’s solicitors wrote to the father’s solicitors conceding that x had flown on both the 5:10 pm and 2:35 pm flights however, that on 5 february, x was removed from school at 12:00 pm to make the 2:35 pm flight and that on 19 february the maternal grandmother accompanied x to make the 5:35 pm flight. the mother proposed that “in the event your client is content to travel to nsw to collect x from school at the conclusion of the school day and, travel from city b to melbourne on friday 19 march, our client is content for this to occur.”
82 on 15 march 2021, the solicitors for the father wrote to the solicitors for the mother advising that she could indeed check in online with an infant and again stated that “in the event that your client fails to facilitate time this weekend, we are instructed to issue proceedings for recovery and relocation without delay.”[18] there was no response to the suggestion that to facilitate time of a friday that the father collect x directly from school in new south wales.
83 on 16 march 2021, the solicitors for the mother forwarded to the solicitor for the father an email confirming that the mother is required to check in in person as she travels with baggage.
84 thus four days after he exercises time with x in melbourne and where y was just 2 months of age, the father threatens on three occasions to issue recovery proceedings for x. it was not suggested at the hearing that the content of these letters were other than in accordance with the father’s instructions.
85 x has travelled to melbourne on a friday afternoon/evening since this time on 6 occasions.
86 on 20 march 2021, the mother accompanied x and y to and from melbourne. the father spent time with x from 20 march 2021 to 21 march 2021. the father spent some time holding y upon arrival and departure from victoria.
87 on 2 april 2021, the mother travelled with x and y to melbourne. x spent the weekend with the father and y spent time with the father at the park.
88 on 13 april 2021, the father travelled to new south wales to collect x for school holiday time from 13 april 2021 to 17 april 2021. prior to his return, the mother advised the father that she had made a mistake with respect to the day that x had to return to school and offered for x to extend his stay with the father if the father would pay for the cost of changing flight times.
89 on 16 april 2021, whilst x was staying with the father, he sent the following email to the mother:
that’s very disappointing to hear that you didn’t do x the courtesy of even looking to see when he actually returns to school, and because of that he now suffers, again. you told me and him he could only be here until saturday as he returns to school on tuesday. and now you’re saying it’s at my expense if we want to fix your mistake???? you should be paying the whole thing as it’s your mistake that’s caused this for your son, you should be paying the entirety, where is your logic in making me pay for the whole thing? it’s going to cost in excess of double the initial flight costs in fees ($55 per flight per person, plus fare differences for each flight which are around $100 each. in future i hope you’ll check these things prior to me booking so our son doesn’t suffer because of your mistakes. and to cap it off you aren’t even willing to pay for the mistake yourself. not a good look mate.[19]
90 28 minutes later the father forwarded a further email to the mother as follows:
i can’t afford to pay for these by myself and i think you know that. i feel sorry for him for your mistake on this and think it’s very sad you then refuse to own it and fix it but instead make it at my expense. very very disappointing ms mooney. the current flight arrival is 8:10pm.[20]
91 the mother’s solicitor on 21 april 2021 wrote to the father’s solicitors and advised that as y was experiencing issues with the travel to melbourne, y would no longer be travelling to melbourne and would not be able to spend time with the father in victoria as a result. the mother suggested that the father travel to new south wales to accompany x on any future flights.
92 the father’s solicitors wrote to the mother’s solicitors on 27 april 2021 stating that the father did not believe it to be in the best interests of x to travel alone back from melbourne as x’s becomes hysterical when leaving the father. the father suggests that x be flown to melbourne unaccompanied and that the mother pay for the entire cost of the father to fly to and from city b airport to accompany x on the return trip. the solicitors for the father state they are of the view that this would be a “constructive alternative.”
93 in the shadow of orders made by consent that x travel as an unaccompanied minor, at 12:21 pm on 27 april 2021, the father then sent an email to the mother as follows:
you want to send him by himself? how exactly is that going to work? you’ve seen how upset he is when i drop him back to the airport even when youre there, imagine how he’ll be on the way back by himself? surely you’re at least going to put me on the flight back with him right? you surely wouldn’t do that to him right?[21]
94 thirty one minutes later the father sent a further email to the mother as follows:
do you think this is demonstrating to the court that you have “the best interests of the child” in your mind? what’s best for x, our child who i’m not sure if you remember has asd, would be you travelling with him, or until you’re medically “well enough” to travel, it should be for me to take him back to you at least on the return leg. that would be in the best interest of our son, and i’m sure the courts and professionals involved will agree. it’s clear at least that i have his best interests at heart as demonstrated in this email chain..[22]
95 later than same evening in an email to the mother entitled “inappropriate lies to x” the father stated:
after you have come up with this idea where you don’t want to/have to travel anymore. this was apparently not enough for you? after my discussion with x over the phone tonight, i’ve just found out that not only are you refusing to travel with him and making our 7 year old autistic son travel alone, but you have now apparently lied to him and said the reason he has to travel alone, is because “daddy doesn’t want to fly with you”. absolutely disgusting behaviour on your part. this is just going one level to the next. for the millionth time, please stop with the lies and parental alienation. if you want to send our son on his own on a plane, you tell him so. don’t blame me, it’s completely 100% on you, and you should be making that clear to him, not lying and saying it’s my choice. he is not to go on his own, certainly not on the way back where he will be distraught at the fact he’s leaving me like always, compiled with the fact he’s then got to get on the plane alone? you can pay for me to take him back to you, seeing as how you’ve conveniently saved yourself a few hundred dollars by you not travelling. it’s not about the money though right? so then you should have no issue with paying for me to accompany him back to city b. he is not to travel alone back to city b. i don’t consent to this. i would think as his caring mother, you would insist me accompanying him back to city b, no? rather than just sending your 7 year old with asd, on a plane willy-nilly by himself? i mean, really ms mooney? this is what you want to go on the record with? that this is what in your mind and your judgement is in “best interests of x”? are you sure that’s the stance you really want to go with? wow. no words. thanks[23]
96 the father copied his solicitor into this correspondence.
97 when asked about this email in cross examination the father, despite having some time to reflect on the tone and tenor of such correspondence confirmed that he felt that the email was reasonable and appropriate.
98 by way of letter dated 28 april 2021 the solicitors for the mother advise the father’s solicitors that the mother cannot afford to purchase a flight for the father to and from city b. the mother proposed that the father accompany x to and from city b on the return flight at his expense.
99 on 29 april 2021, the father sent an email to the mother as follows:
you know full well how upset and emotional he will be for this on the way back leaving me. i still don’t understand how you as a mother, would subject your own child to this. it defies belief. how can you do this to him? this really will highlight to the court the differences in our parenting, and the way we treat x won’t it, and whose in touch with his “best interests”, and who is not. you claiming he’s fine leaving me? and will be fine to go on the plane, alone? you surely don’t really believe that right? you want that on record to the court as your opinion on what you believe your child will be feeling? really, are you sure? believe me the proof will be there come sunday night, demonstrating exactly whose in touch with his emotions and who knows how he will react, and what’s in his best interests. will be right there for the court black and white. it will tell the court all they need to know, don’t you think? i hope you make sure he knows it’s all because his mother doesn’t want to travel with him anymore, because he deserves to know the truth. i would recommend you re-book a flight so i can take him back for you, and that that would be better for him and his mental health. this will prove to be the right decision come sunday night. the court will see this too, i promise you. how can you do this to our poor little boy? you should take a really hard look at yourself as his mother, because your so out of touch on what’s best for him, and just trying to get out of travel and save a few bucks, at his expense. i feel so sorry for him. unfathomable.[24]
100 from the weekend of 1 may 2021, x began travelling to melbourne to spend time with the father as an unaccompanied minor.
101 on the 4 may 2021 the father filed an application in a case seeking short notice listing of his interim application that x live with him and spend time with the mother in city b with the parties to jointly pay for the father to accompany x each way, together with orders that y live with the mother and spend time with the father during times that x was seeing the mother.
102 the father spent time with x in melbourne the weekend of 15 may 2021 and 12 june 2021 with x travelling as an unaccompanied minor.
103 in an email to the mother from the father on 13 june 2021 the father states:
x seems to be coming down in the same clothes every fortnight? is there a reason for this? as part of the child support that is paid to you, it is meant to also be used to purchase new clothes for our children, is this not happening or? not to mention whenever i send him back in different clothes i’ve bought, they stay up there and you send him back in old clothes again? got pictures from every fortnight to prove it, before you deny this..... i can’t believe i even have to put this sort of thing in an email. come on, ms mooney.[25]
104 the mother deposes that she was upset and offended by the father’s email. it is the mother’s unchallenged evidence that x suffers from sensory challenges and she has observed that he is very particular with his clothes and often wears the same outfit that he is comfortable in. i accept this evidence.
105 the father spent time with x from 6 july 2021 to 11 july 2021 and again from 23 to 29 july 2021 with x travelling as an unaccompanied minor.
106 from approximately 24 july 2021 y started to join in with x’s facetime calls with the father.
107 the father spent time with x from 6 august 2021 to 9 august 2021, from 22 august 2021 to 27 august 2021, and the 3 september 2021 to 6 september 2021 in melbourne.
108 on the 10 september 2021 the father’s application in a case filed on 4 may 2021 was heard. a senior judicial registrar made orders that, pending further order, the parties have equal shared parental responsibility for the children, with the mother to return with the children to live in victoria within 45 days. orders were made for x and y to spend time with the father.
109 the father spent time with x on the weekend of 17 september 2021 and 29 september 2021 with x travelling as an unaccompanied minor.
110 on 6 october 2021 the mother filed an application for a review of the interim orders made on the 10 september 2021. on 15 october 2021 the court stayed the orders of the senior judicial registrar and listed the review for hearing on the first day of the trial.
111 the father spent time with x from 13 october 2021 to 17 october 2021 in melbourne with x travelling as an unaccompanied minor.
112 on 29 october 2021, the mother travelled with x and y to melbourne. the father spent time with x from 29 october 2021 to 31 october 2021. the father spent time with y at arrival and departure at a park on 2 occasions for 45 minutes.
the matters in dispute
family violence
113 the mother asserts that the father engaged in family violence through controlling and coercive behaviour both throughout the relationship and post separation.
114 family violence is defined in the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act’) as violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of that person’s family or causes them to be fearful.
115 both parties gave evidence as to the termination of their first pregnancy in 2012. it is the mother’s evidence that she did not feel supported in victoria and did not feel ready to have a baby at such a young age. the mother deposes that the father flew into a fit of rage when she advised him of her decision, punching a wall and breaking his hand. in cross examination the mother conceded that the father had a half cast, but that she thought the father’s hand was broken. the mother deposes that the father’s reaction made her feel scared, unsupported and alone. the father told the mother that as he did not agree with her decision, he would not assist in the termination either financially or by taking her to the appointment. the maternal grandmother paid for the procedure and the paternal grandmother accompanied the mother to the appointment.
116 the father conceded during the course of cross examination that he was upset at the mother’s decision to terminate the pregnancy and punched the outside of the house with his hand as he was leaving. this was consistent with the paternal grandmother’s evidence that he punched a wooden wall outside. he conceded that he advised the mother that he would not assist her with the costs as he was “very, very wild and upset,”[26] that he could have responded to the situation better, that the mother was unsupported in her decision and probably felt that way. in direct contrast to that evidence is the father’s reported statement to the family report writer that he “respected and supported ms mooneys decision to not proceed with the pregnancy.” [27] the father did not explain this inconsistency.
117 i find that the father punched the outside wall in a fit of rage on his way out of the home after a discussion with the mother as to her decision to terminate the pregnancy. i accept that the father did not support the mother emotionally, physically or financially with respect to this decision as he did not agree with it. i accept that the mother as a result felt alone and unsupported.
118 the mother alleges that the father engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour with respect to her personal appearance. it is the mother’s evidence that the father made her feel pressured and insisted that she undertake a breast augmentation procedure that she did not wish to have. the mother provided the father with available dates for the surgery and the father booked, signed the surgery papers and paid for it. the mother deposes that the father was not happy with the size of the breast implants selected by her and made another appointment for her to see the plastic surgeon so she could try bigger sizes. the mother deposes “i wanted to keep mr jameson happy so i went to the appointment.”
119 the father was unequivocal in his evidence that it was the mother that wanted the breast augmentation surgery to be undertaken and that he signed the surgery papers, attended with her for the appointments and paid for it as the money was coming from a particular account.
120 having heard each of the parties under cross examination about this issue, i accept the mother’s evidence. i find the father’s reason as to why he executed the documentation, attended with the mother for appointments and paid for the surgery unconvincing. i am satisfied that the mother felt pressured by the father to have this surgery. i find that the mother underwent this surgery as it was the father’s wish and she wanted to keep the father happy.
121 the mother asserts that the father would tell her to go and get a spray tan as he did not like how white she was. she did not resile from this in cross examination.  unsel for the father] so why did you do it? [the mother] because he kept telling me to go and do it and wouldn’t take no for an answer.[28]
122 the father denied this in cross examination and said that the mother wanted to have the spray tans. having heard and observed each of the witnesses i accept the mother’s evidence that the father would tell the mother that she should have spray tans as he did not like how “white she was.” i found the mother’s evidence to have a ring of authenticity and the father’s denial to be unconvincing.
123 the mother further deposes that the father insisted that she dye her hair, telling her she looked better with blonde hair. the mother asserts that the father would say words to the effect of: “don’t you care enough about me to look good?” however in cross examination the mother appeared to concede that the father did not ask her to dye her hair blonde.  unsel for the father] okay. and did you ask him whether or not he thought you would look good with blonde hair? [the mother] definitely not. [counsel for the father] his evidence is that that’s what happened and he didn’t ask you to dye your hair blonde. that’s right, isn’t it? [the mother] if that is what he said, yes.
124 i am cannot be satisfied in light of this apparent concession that the father insisted the mother dye her hair blonde.
125 on balance, i find that this relationship was characterised by the father directing the mother as his wishes, opinions and desires and the mother conceding those to make the father happy.
126 the mother alleges that the father was financially controlling both during and post separation. she asserts that “most of the time” she was not allowed to spend money without first obtaining the father’s permission to do so.[29] “i would not say free access, because most of the time, i was not allowed to use it unless i got permission.”[30] it was her evidence that she closed her own bank account and the parties operated one single joint bank account at the father’s insistence. she asserts that upon purchasing groceries she would have to show the father the receipts. she was unshaken in cross examination that the father would not allow her to purchase her triplet brothers presents for their 21st birthdays, nor would he allow her to purchase presents for her family.
127 it was the mother’s unchallenged evidence that on or about 24 december 2019 she purchased some christmas bon bons thinking they were $5.00 a packet. upon arriving home and realising they were $10.00 a packet she was so worried as to how angry the father would be that she drove back to the shops to return them. i accept that this occurred and was how the mother felt.
128 the father denied exerting financial control over the mother. he conceded that he suggested that the mother close her own bank account as there did not seem to be any utility in having two bank accounts. he conceded he would have asked the mother about purchases she made if they were “too expensive” or “it wasn’t on special” but not routinely.[31] he stated that he did not keep a closer eye on the account than “anyone would keep on their account.”[32] he denied asking the mother for receipts for purchases made by her, or that he told the mother they could not afford her purchasing 21st birthday presents for her brothers.
129 having heard both parties in cross examination i am satisfied on balance that the mother’s version of events is more likely and i so find. i am satisfied that as between the two parties the father raised the mother’s spending habits with her to such an extent that she was concerned as to whether the father would be upset with purchases she had made. i accept that the father told the mother that they could not afford presents for her brothers’ 21st birthday. i accept and find that the father insisted the mother close her bank account.
130 it is agreed that the mother advised the father that she did not want to be a stay at home mother. the father denies the mother’s assertion that he told her he wanted her to be a stay at home mother. the father says that the mother did not go back to studying for her transport licences as she “lacked motivation.”[33] in circumstances where the father conceded in cross examination that in order to pay for a holiday the mother was going on he gave her the deposit and then suggested that she get a part time job such as waitressing to pay for the rest, i am not satisfied that the father insisted on the mother not engaging in paid employment outside the home.
131 issues as to the father’s financial contribution to the children have arisen between the parties subsequent their separation.
132 whilst in hotel quarantine in new south wales with x in september 2020 the mother arranged for a friend to buy her groceries and transferred the money from the parties’ joint account to the friend. it was the mother’s unchallenged evidence that the father called the mother shortly thereafter and said to the mother “what could you need that would cost that much money?” i accept that evidence.
133 the father sent a text message to the mother on the 1 december 2020 proposing that in lieu of formal child support the father would set up an account with a “buffer in there of say $1,000” for the mother to use on x’s expenses and he would replenish it as needed.[34] the tone and tenor of this text message is in stark contrast to the majority of other text messages sent by the father to the mother. the mother deposes that the parties spoke on the telephone regarding the proposal and the father said: “you can show me the receipts monthly for what you’ve spent the money on.”
134 in cross examination, the father, when asked if he was upset that he was going to have to pay $300 per week in child support, stated:  e father] i was – i was upset. like, it actually says, “you’re going to claim 100 per cent care of x”. that’s – that’s what i was upset about, because the 100 per cent care of x was not by my choice, as we know. i absolutely wanted x to be in victoria with – with me. so claiming 100 per cent care of him to get the most child support possible, i didn’t like that idea. hence, my proposal of i will pay whatever the children need, whether that’s school fees, medical bills, shopping, whatever you need, i – there will be an account there with a certain amount of money all the time to be used on the children, and that’s why i – that’s why i’ve said that the issue was the 100 per cent care, because i don’t believe that she should get the maximum amount and put 100 per cent care if that’s – if i wanted to be there fifty-fifty. i – it’s just that i can’t. she’s – she has gone to new south wales and refused to come back and is benefiting financially off it ‑ ‑ ‑ [35]
135 i find that the father’s request to pay monies directly into a bank account to the wife carried with it a flavour of control. i find that this proposal was a method by which the father could mandate that any monies he paid would be applied directly to x’ expenses.
136 i find that the father engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour both during the parties’ separation and post separation. i find that the content, language, tone and intensity of the father’s correspondence to the mother as set out in these reasons, coupled with its volume, is of a coercive and controlling character. such correspondence included the father’s email messages and correspondence from his solicitors. i find that the father was a dominant partner and that the mother was more often than not, submissive during the relationship. the mother “standing her ground” after the separation produced an increase in the threatening undertones of the father’s communications. the capital letters used by the father in such correspondence is akin to the father shouting at the mother and is intimidatory and threatening.
the mother’s relocation to new south wales
137 there is significant dispute between the parties as to the circumstances surrounding the mother flying with x to new south wales, commencing to live with her sister and mother and not returning to live in victoria.
138 it is uncontroversial that on 25 september 2020 a conversation occurred between the parties similar to the following:
father: “i don’t want to be with you right now.” mother: “what does that mean? you either do or you don’t want to be with me.” father: “i don’t. you should go to nsw and be with your family.”
139 it is agreed that the mother packed several bags weighing between approximately 50-60 kilograms. it is not agreed as to whether boxes were also packed. it appears that the mother is suggesting that an inference should be drawn that this supports the mother’s assertion that the parties both knew and agreed that she was relocating to new south wales with x, whilst pregnant with y. i cannot draw such inference.
140 there is dispute as to what, if any, conversations occurred as to the mother returning with x to victoria. the father’s affidavit contained no evidence on this topic. the father could not explain why there is no evidence in his affidavit of any conversations between the parties prior to the mother and x leaving as to when (or if) she would return.
141 in cross examination the father asserted that there were conversations between the parties as to the mother’s return date and they centred around a time frame of two to three weeks. the father’s evidence was that subsequent to arriving in new south wales the mother kept changing her plans as to when she was returning to victoria causing him to commence proceedings on an urgent basis. it is the father’s view that the mother had planned to come back but then her mother and sister changed her mind.
142 the mother deposes that it was the father who told her at the time of separation that she should go to new south wales to be with her family and that they subsequently had a conversation wherein the father advised her that he would pay for the hotel quarantine and reimburse the mother’s sister for the cost of the mother and x’s flight to new south wales. she asserts that there was no discussion about returning to victoria. the mother asserts that she was of the view that she had the father’s express permission to permanently relocate to new south wales. the mother deposes that “at no time did i indicate to mr jameson that i was returning to victoria on any particular date. i had no intention of returning to victoria.”[36]
143 whilst in quarantine the mother asserts that the parties had the following conversation:
mother: “when we get out of quarantine and get to mum’s i will enrol him in school down the road.” father: “okay. he has already missed a fair amount of school so that would be a good idea.”
144 the mother asserts that it was only after the mother made a claim for child support to be paid by the father that he indicated to her “i will do whatever it takes to have you brought back here. i can’t believe you expect me to pay this amount of child support. it’s not going to happen.”[37]
145 the mother’s evidence during cross examination was at times inconsistent. her evidence was that the father had proposed and agreed that she relocate to new south wales to live. she then asserted during cross examination that she never told the father when she was going back to victoria. she then stated that “i kept putting mr jameson off because i didn’t want to have any conversations like that with him.”[38] she said that she cannot remember telling the father that she would book a flight. she then asserted that she told the father “definitively” that she was not coming back, but that he would not take that as an answer. the mother conceded that she may have let the father think that she was considering going back to victoria. the mother further conceded that the father was asking her when she and x were going back to victoria within 1-2 weeks of her arrival in new south wales.
146 based on each of the parties’ evidence and the admissions made during the course of cross examination i am satisfied on the balance of probabilities that both parties agreed at the time of the breakdown of their relationship that it was best that the mother and x travel to new south wales to be with her family for a period of time. this was consistent with what had occurred earlier in the parties’ relationship. as was the case earlier, and at the date of separation, the father recognised the need for the mother to have the support of her family at this time.
147 i am not satisfied that at the time of leaving the mother advised the father that she was intending to relocate to new south wales permanently. i find it more likely than not that if the mother had advised the father of her intention, he would have commenced urgent proceedings with the court to seek orders restraining the mother relocating with x.
148 the parties spent a lot of time at the hearing on the subject matter of if, and when, the mother advised the father she was relocating permanently with x to new south wales. i cannot make a safe finding on this topic. what is uncontroversial is that the mother left victoria in september 2020 and upon her not returning the father commenced proceedings in this court.
the incident on 6 march 2021 at melbourne airport
149 on the 6 march 2021 the mother took y for the first time to melbourne with x to visit the father. she took her friend mr k who gave evidence in the proceedings. i accept that the mother did this as she was concerned about travelling with y and x together for the first time. y cried on the plane. by the time the mother arrived at the airport in melbourne y had fallen asleep in the carrier strapped to the mother’s chest.
150 it is the mother’s evidence that:- she was standing at the foot of the escalator waiting to put x on it to meet the father when she heard the father’s voice behind her, and saw that he had surprised x. the father then took out his phone and at eye level commenced filming her whilst repeatedly saying to the mother “can i see my daughter, can i hold my daughter, why won’t you let me hold my daughter”. the mother told the father to stop and the father said “please, please, please let me hold my baby girl” before putting the phone away and saying “thanks. i got what i needed.” mr k said to the father: “you’re such a big man aren’t you?” the father then started shouting words to the effect “who’s that? is that your new boyfriend? oh and i am sleeping with someone. ohhhh.” the mother and mr k walked away whereupon the mother alleges the father yelled out “slut” in the hearing of x.
151 it is mr k’s evidence that:- upon arrival at the airport the mother was getting ready to put x on the escalator and she was saying goodbye to x when he observed the father appear out from behind a pole and say something to x, he could not hear what, and give him “half a hug.” it appeared to mr k that x and the father were going to walk away, but he observed the father turn around and pull out his phone and hold it up in the mother’s direction. the father moved closer to the mother and started saying to her “why won’t you let me hold my daughter. why won’t you let me see me daughter.” he heard the father repeat this several times with his phone pointed at the mother. mr k approached the mother and said to her: “come, on let’s go. nothing good can come from this. this is no good.” the mother said to the father: “please stop filming me, this is really inappropriate, you shouldn’t be doing this in front of x, please stop filming me, this is really not okay.” the father put his phone down and said: “i got what i needed, thank you.” the father then clapped his hands in front of the mother. mr k could see that the mother was visibly distressed and said to the father: “you’re such a big man, aren’t you” to which the father replied in a raised voice “who the fuck do you think you are?” and then then said to the mother: “is this your new boyfriend.” mr k said: “righto mate you are a coward.” mr k observed x to be standing to the side and it appeared that he looked uncomfortable and frightened and mr k then suggested to the mother that they should leave. mr k asserts that the mother was upset and crying about the incident over the course of the weekend and said for him not to come into the airport as the father would not give x back to her if he was there, so he waited outside the airport until changeover occurred.
152 the father’s affidavit is silent as to this incident. there was no explanation by the father during the hearing as to why this incident was not in his affidavit. during cross examination the father conceded that he had the recording of the incident. the recording was only produced when the mother required that it be produced during the course of the hearing. it was tendered and marked as exhibit m2. i am unaware as to whether this recording was disclosed in accordance with the rules.
153 the recording was tendered by the mother and i have watched it. y appears to be asleep in a papoose strapped to the mother’s chest. it commences with the father approaching the mother filming her and saying:
father: why? mother: [sic] ok i see you filming me mr jameson father: can i have a hold of the baby please mother: no, because last fortnight you abused my mum and i don’t want to be around that. (by this time the father is standing very close in front of the mother and filming her.) father: no, she abused me, can i hold the baby. mother: no. father: please. why can i not? mother: mr jameson. father: tell me why i can’t please. mother: because i don’t consent to you filming me right now in front of our children. that’s not appropriate
154 the mother appears to indicate to her side and a giggle of a child can be heard. i have assumed that this was x.
father: in victoria you don’t have to actually. mother: that’s not appropriate.
155 mr k was cross examined. he gave his evidence in a clear and forthright manner. his version of events largely supported that of the mother. he conceded that it was not good for x for himself and the father to be yelling at each other and stated that x was cowering, and did not look happy. he stated that he saw the father clap his hands near the mother. i accept the evidence of mr k.
156 in cross examination the father conceded that he asked “is this your new boyfriend.”[39] the father asserted that due to a false allegation made by the mother at the prior changeover as to his conduct towards the maternal grandmother he felt he needed to record the interaction and that “x would not even have known that it was filming.”[40] extraordinarily, the father asserted during the course of his evidence: “both x and i were in fear.”[41] he further asserted that abuse from mr k occurred prior to his starting the recording. the father conceded in cross examination that he said to the mother after he stopped filming: “thanks, i got what i needed.”[42]
157 the version of events as given by the mother and mr k is consistent. they did not resile from their evidence. i am not convinced that the situation could have been avoided as was suggested by the father if the mother has told the father that mr k would be in attendance. i find that the father was the instigator of this incident and that he progressed this exchange in a calculated attempt to obtain evidence to use in these proceedings in circumstances where he knew that x was present and could see the interaction. it had an aspect of staging. i find that he was not at any time in fear and that his evidence to that effect was manufactured in an attempt to achieve an advantage in these proceedings. i find that he was filming the mother so as to obtain what he perceived to be evidence painting the mother in a bad light for the trial in this matter in that she was withholding y from him. i accept that this occurred in front of x. it does the father little credit and i agree with counsel for the mother that this incident showed a “stunning” lack of insight by the father as to the children’s best interests.
158 i find the father’s behaviour as to this event reflective of the calculation evident in the exchanges with the mother post separation and to, on balance, be likely as to his future conduct with the mother in the event she is to live in victoria.
159 despite this incident the mother then arranged to take y to the paternal grandmother’s home to visit with the father where the visit went for an hour with the mother staying for the first 30 minutes and then leaving for approximately 30 minutes.
the family report
160 ms m’s recommendations were that:- the parents have equal shared parental responsibility. the children live with the mother in victoria. that x spend time with the father each alternate week from 4:00 pm on thursday to 4:00 pm on sunday and in week 2, from 4:00 pm on thursday to friday morning. that y spend time with the father:- each thursday following x’s changeover at school and each alternate sunday at 4:00 pm, preferably at the local library, at the local library reading session each week (between 30-60 minutes). if this is not possible, then consideration could be given for another weekly activity that y and the father could undertake together such as a swimming lesson. after 4-6 weeks, each saturday or sunday for 2 hours when x is also having his time and another weekly activity, without the mother in attendance. time then progresses so that y spends time with the father each saturday and on the alternate weeks that x is seeing his father, that this time extends on a progressive basis (eg week one when x is there each saturday 9am – 4pm and week two 9am – 11am) together with a midweek activity. both parents complete a post separation program, an educational program and online resources being “watch, wait and wonder” and “circle of security” together with considering engaging an expert family consultant to support and strengthen the parental alliance. the parties to use the our family wizard application to communicate.
161 the family report was prepared prior to the parties filing their substantive affidavits for the final hearing in the matter. ms m was not provided with copies of the parties’ substantive affidavits at any time during the course of the matter. her oral evidence proceeded without having had the benefit of reading them. she had not read the material tendered by each of the parties, nor were any of the documents put to her in cross examination. i find that this is a significant limitation undermining the foundations of the recommendations of report.
162 the family report writer did not address the issue of family violence in any meaningful way in her report. it did not mention any of the allegations made by the mother as to coercive and controlling behaviours by the father either during the relationship or post separation. it did not address the allegations raised by the mother as to the circumstances surrounding the termination of the first pregnancy. it records the father reported to her that “he respected and supported ms mooneys decision to not proceed with the pregnancy.”[43] on the father’s own oral evidence this is incorrect. the report does not address the implications flowing from the tone and tenor of the correspondence from the father to the mother post separation.
163 the weight i place on the report is reduced in light of the findings as to family violence made above.
the law
164 matters involving issues as to relocation are to be determined in the same manner as all parenting matters - by following the legislative framework set out in the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”). they are not a special category of case: morgan & miles [2007] famca 1230, (2007) 312 flr 114 at [72], sayer & radcliffe & anor [2012] famcafc 209, (2012) 48 fam lr 298, 311 at [47] and [48].
165 the court is to make such parenting orders as it considers proper and in doing so is to regard the best interests of the children as the paramount consideration. the children’s best interests are ascertained by a consideration of the objects and principles in section 60b and the primary and additional considerations in section 60cc of the act.
166 the objects are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by:- ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.
167 the principles underlying these objects (except when it is or would be contrary to a child’s best interests) are that: children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).
168 the primary considerations as set out in s 60cc(2) are:  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
169 in balancing these considerations, the court is to give greater weight to the need to protect the children from harm or being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
170 section 60cc(3) sets out the additional considerations for the court in determining what is in the children’s best interests.
171 whilst the best interests of the children are the paramount consideration, they are not the sole consideration of the court. the full court in franklyn & franklyn [2019] famcafc 256 stated: ] .....while the children’s interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii...parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to children...only where the children’s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent’s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children’s best interests (see u v u at 262).
172 kirby j observed in ams v aif [1999] hca 26 at [145], (1999) 199 clr 160 that:  5]...one of the objects of modern family law statutes...is to enable parties to a broken relationship to start a new life for themselves, to control their own future destinies and, where desired, to form new relationships, free from unnecessary interference from a former spouse or partner or from a court. courts recognise that unwarranted interference in the life of a custodial parent may itself occasion bitterness towards the former spouse or partner which may be transmitted to the child or otherwise impinge on the happiness of the custodial (or residence) parent in a way likely to affect the welfare or best interests of the child. this said, the touchstone for the ultimate decision must remain the welfare or best interests of the child and not, as such, the wishes and interests of the parents...
173 the judgment of the full court in asher & wilkinson [2020] famcafc 44 again reaffirmed the high court’s decisions in ams v aif [1999] hca 26, (1999) 199 clr 160 and u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 (“u v u”) that it is not the case that a party wishing to relocate must establish “compelling reasons” stating: ].....the task before the primary judge was to determine what parenting orders were in the child’s best interests. it was not to determine the location in which the mother was “permitted” to live. the use of that phrase in the context that it was used tends to focus on the mother having to justify to the court where she wishes to live and obtain its approval. the use of that phrase obscures, if not overrides, the mother’s undoubted right to live where she chooses.
174 conversely, as stated by the full court in malcolm & monroe and anor [2011] famcafc 16, (2011) flc 93-460 at 85,515:
83....equally, there is no onus on a parent who may be “left behind” to demonstrate reasons as to why the other parent should not relocate.....it is properly part of a court’s inquiry to consider what each parent proposes and to determine the context of those plans and reasons for them in determining what is in the best interests of a child.
175 whilst the court must consider the competing proposals of each of the parties in accordance with the legislative pathway, it is not bound by the parties’ proposals when determining what is in the children’s best interests: see u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238.
176 it is not disputed between the parties that the court has the power to make an order requiring a parent to relocate with a child. it is the mother’s submission, however, that the order as sought by the father that the mother relocate with the children to victoria is a coercive order and should only be made in rare and exceptional circumstances. it is the father’s submission that it is not a coercive order in circumstances where the mother has said that she will relocate to victoria if ordered to do so.
177 in sampson and hartnett (no. 10) [2007] famca 1365 the full court stated: ]. however, we conclude that there is power under s 114(3) of the act to enjoin a parent from relocating or to relocate, provided that that injunction is no more than is necessary to secure the best interests of a child. the proper exercise of such a power is likely to be rare, because: (i) the location of the child will usually be the critical factor, leaving to the parents the choice about their roles, and (ii) in a parenting case, an order directed to a parent to relocate or not will likely only serve a useful purpose if that parent is to then discharge a particular role as a parent. if the evidence supports a finding that the parent will play that role, if the child is relocated or not, the order directed to the parent will likely be superfluous. if the evidence does not support such a finding, the order will be coercive in nature and be equivalent to forcing that parent to discharge a role in circumstances not of that parent’s choosing. [59]. the prospect of ordering a parent to relocate and in effect “parent” in a situation not of that parent’s choosing, legitimately gives rise to concerns, particularly in respect of enforcement.
178 in adamson & adamson [2014] famcafc 232 the full court quoted with approval sampson stating:  ]...it follows that there should exist “rare” or “extreme” factors that warrant the court exercising its discretion to make “coercive” orders requiring a parent to relocate so as to continue to be the primary carer of their child/children.
179 in oswald & karrington [2016] famcafc 152 the full court stated:- ]....importantly though, it is well established that the proper exercise of that power is “at the extreme end of the discretionary range”[44] and there should exist “rare” or “extreme” factors that warrant the court exercising its discretion to make a coercive order requiring a parent to relocate so as to continue to perform the role of primary caregiver of children.[45] [17] consequently, as emphasised by the full court in d and sv[46] and by the full court in sampson and hartnett (no 10) (supra), there is an imperative for the court to explore and consider alternatives to restricting freedom of movement, particularly when the coercive order will require a party to relocate contrary to that party’s proposal, and involve a primary caregiver undertaking that role in a place not of that parent’s choosing. and [61] risk assessment aside, given the mother’s unchallenged role as primary carer, a proper assessment had to be made as to the benefits for the mother, and thus her capacity to perform her primary caring role for the benefit of the children under her proposal that she and the children live in town b, as compared with her living in the town c region, contrary to her desires. consideration had to be given to the consequences for the children if the mother did not comply with the coercive order, and enforcement was pursued...
180 the full court’s view is clear that if a parent who is seeking to relocate with a child concedes that they will stay and continue to parent the child if unsuccessful in obtaining the order they seek then an order refusing to permit relocation of the child is not a coercive one: sampson and hartnett (no. 10) [2007] famca 1365
181 an order however requiring a parent to move to a new location is a coercive order: sampson and hartnett (no. 10) [2007] famca 1365:  ] as indicated earlier, the purpose of a “coercive” order is more to create a situation, rather than choose between situations that already exist... [53] in d and sv...the full court.....considered the degree to which, generally, alternatives to restricting freedom of movement ought to be explored. their comments apply equally or more so to an order requiring relocation, contrary to a party’s proposals... [57] if it is within power to order a person not to relocate, it would be surprising if it was not within power to order a person to relocate, although one would imagine the exercises of power to the latter effect would be even more rare, because the effect is more drastic. the person being ordered not to move at least has chosen that location at some stage and for reasons which one assumes at leats once existed. this contrasts with a person who may not wish to go somewhere and therefore the order is much more of an imposition on that person’s freedom.
182 the full court stated in kuan v toh (2016) flc 93-717 that only rare or extreme factors warrant the court exercising its discretion to make coercive orders requiring a parent to relocate so as to continue to be the primary carer of the parties’ children.
183 the mother and children have now been living in new south wales for 17 months. there is no dispute that the orders sought by the father will not result in them returning to a home they have previously lived in. on the mother’s evidence it will result in them moving to a suburb they have not lived in previously. thus an order to relocate to victoria will involve the mother and the children moving to a new location not of the mother’s choosing.
184 the mother is the uncontested resident parent irrespective of where the children are to reside. she has stated to the court unequivocally that she does not wish to relocate to victoria with the children to live. an order requiring the children to live in victoria with the mother will be forcing her to continue to be the primary carer in circumstances not of her choosing.
185 consistent with the above authorities it is my view that the order sought by the father has the character of a coercive order. i am mindful in those circumstances of the guidance provided by the full court that, when weighing up and considering each of the parties’ proposals in accordance with the legislative pathway to determine what orders are in the children’s best interest, that such an order should be made in rare or extreme circumstances. at all times however, the best interests of the children remain the paramount consideration and those best interests are determined by a consideration of the primary and additional considerations in s 60cc of the act.
possibility of the father’s relocation
186 whilst neither party has the onus to establish compelling reasons as to why they wish or do not wish to relocate, a consideration as to the possibility that the father could relocate to new south wales to avail himself of more time with the children must be explored. hayne j in u v u [2002] hca 36 at [175] stated: 5] when one parent (for whatever reason) wishes a child who is, or is to be, resident with that parent to move to a place distant from the other parent, it should not be assumed that that other parent cannot, or should not, contemplate moving to be near the child. there may be (and for all that is known, in this case there was) compelling reason for that other parent (here, the father) not to move, but it would ordinarily be expected that these reasons would be explored in evidence and the validity of any assumption that the other parent will not move would be examined. just as, in this case, the mother was asked what she would do, if she could not have the child reside with her in india, so too it might have been expected that the father would be asked what he would do, if the mother were to have the child reside with her in india...
187 gaudron j further stated at [35]:  ] ...it is noteworthy that in this case there was no consideration of the possibility that the father could return to india permanently to avail himself of frequent and regular contact with his daughter. the failure to explore that possibility...seems to me to be explicable only on the basis of an assumption, inherently sexist, that a father's choice as to where he lives is beyond challenge in a way that a mother's is not.
188 the family report writer accepted the father’s contention absent any enquiry that he could not move to new south wales. the report does not record any material testing of the father’s contention. the family report writer reports that the “prospect of any separation from his children is clearly a great loss for mr jameson, valuing his role as father and seeking to increase his involvement with the children that would be limited by any permanent relocation to nsw.”[47]
189 ms m reported “he is unable to support time arrangements for the child x to travel to melbourne, with no meaningful time spent with his daughter since her birth in 2021.”[48] when asked by me what she meant by “unable to support time arrangements” ms m responded “i think what i meant was that he didn’t support the mother’s proposals that the way in which he would spend time with x is for him to live in sydney and travel to melbourne, as opposed to living in melbourne. i think that’s what i meant: unable to support arrangements for the child just to travel to melbourne to spend time.”
190 when asked by me as to whether she had explored with the father his ability to otherwise to relocate to new south wales, ms m stated: “and what he explained was that the job that he’s in, which is one of a few, means that he can work in the system but have flexibility to parent and be involved in the children, as opposed to the shift work that he did, which as a family he felt added a level of strain and difficulty to the family, and that the only opportunities for employment in new south wales would be to go back to the shift work........it wasn’t so much ...not being able to transfer to another facility wasn’t so much the issue. it was the type of role that he’s in.”[49]
191 the father’s affidavit is silent as to why he would not or could not relocate to new south wales, or if he has ever considered it. the only possible reference to this issue in any way is: “my job was created as a response to the ongoing violence in centres, and i only became a candidate for my role due to my experience in the field as i have not transferable qualifications.” the cross examination of the father on this issue was illuminating:-  unsel for the mother] mr jameson, one possibility that would lead to you being able to spend a great deal of time with the children would be for you to live in new south wales, wouldn’t it? [the father] yes. [counsel for the mother] right. is there a reason you can’t do that? [the father] i believe it would take away from the support that the children currently get. as you know, your client doesn’t work, lives off the child support and centrelink. so if i’m not able to work in my current field up there, which i can’t because i’m not qualified, as i put in my response – it has taken me five years of working in my current workplace to actually obtain this job, and it’s a job that has become available, that has been created off the back of the crisis in victoria, off the back of worksafe recommendations. so it’s not a job that exists in other precincts interstate. so therefore, as i’ve seen from your client’s response, she would like me to work at employer dd, which obviously takes away from the children greatly, their support, what i can give, which is why i believe victoria, down here where they were living, it would cover both those things. i would be able to support them in both those ways. [counsel for the mother] mr jameson, it’s not necessary, is it, for you to work in the field that you’re currently in. it’s your preference, certainly, but it’s not necessary, is it? [the father] i mean, define necessary. [counsel for the mother] do you not understand? [the father] well, what do you mean by necessary in this context? [counsel for the mother] you could work in a different field, couldn’t you, either in victoria or in new south wales? [the father] i could work at mcdonald’s, i could work at employer dd. yes, if that’s the question. that’s correct. i could. [counsel for the mother] you worked with a financial advisor, didn’t you, the last time you lived in new south wales? [the father] yes, for a few months, i believe. yes. just as a – basically doing admin work. [counsel for the mother] so even though the job you’re specifically doing at the moment might not exist in new south wales, new south wales does have a department. you’re aware of that? [the father] yes. absolutely. [counsel for the mother] and you may not be qualified for a role that is commensurate with the role that you have now, but you could get another role, whether it’s with them or with someone else. correct? [the father] i could apply for a role, certainly. [counsel for the mother] yes. and as i understand it, your objection to doing so is that you might not make as much money if you were to do that, and you might not be able to contribute as much for the benefit of the children. is that right? [the father] yes. i mean, that would absolutely be a career change but, you know, we’ve spent – with ms mooney’s support as well, i’ve spent five years in this field. i would be in a completely different role. it’s [counsel for the mother] i’m not – sorry, go on? [the father].... just because it’s in the same centre doesn’t mean it’s the same role. there’s a million different roles within a centre, but it would be a career change because a security officer is not what i am. so ..... the job that [counsel for the mother] i’m not suggesting this is something that you want to do, but it’s something that you could do if it meant spending more time with the children, couldn’t you? [the father] i could apply. i don’t know what their prerequisites are for those jobs. i don’t know if you need a degree for those jobs in new south wales [counsel for the mother] you’ve not made any inquiries then. you just don’t know? [the father] to change careers? no, i have not. [counsel for the mother] yes. or to apply for some sort of similar job in new south wales? [the father] like i said, the similar job doesn’t exist, so i haven’t made those inquiries.[50]
192 i find that the father has not actively considered the possibility of his relocating to somewhere close to where the children are currently residing so that he can see them on a regular basis, thus promoting a meaningful relationship with them. my impression of his manner and answers to this line of questioning was that he had only given lip service to these enquiries.
193 in the spectre of the father not wanting to move to new south wales, the mother was cross examined about her reasons for wishing to remain living in new south wales, including in the following manner: unsel for the father] so one of the things that ms m says is that that’s about what’s your – meeting your needs, but it’s not meeting the children’s needs because they’re taken away, the parents have to live separately geographically, do you understand that? [the mother] yes. [counsel for the father] okay. do you understand that what she’s saying is that what she’s saying is that you’re making a choice for your needs as opposed to the children’s needs? [the mother] yes, i understand that she said that. [counsel for the father] okay. and that’s right, isn’t it? [the mother] no. [counsel for the father] you could cope if you were in melbourne, couldn’t you? [the mother] i don’t think so, no.
194 i find that it is the father’s view that the children should live in close proximity to each of their parents and, as he does not wish to move, then the mother must.
the primary considerations
the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of the children’s parents
195 in mazorski v albright [2007] famca 520, (2007) 37 famlr 518 brown j concluded at [26] that a meaningful relationship or meaningful involvement is “...one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one.”
196 in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 the full court (at [118]) adopted what is described as “the prospective approach” as the preferred approach to s60cc(2)(a) so that the court: “should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents.”
197 the full court in vontek & vontek [2017] famcafc 28 referred to the full court in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 who quoted a single judge decision of kay j sitting in the appellate jurisdiction of the court in godfrey & sanders [2007] famca 102:“...[e]ven if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.”
198 both parties are of the view, as is ms m, that it is in the best interests of both children that they have a meaningful relationship with both the mother and the father. i accept this to be the case.
199 the primary basis for the father seeking an order that the children and the mother be ordered to relocate to the state of victoria is his assertion that their remaining in new south wales will adversely impact upon the children’s ability to have and maintain a meaningful relationship with him in circumstances where he will not move to new south wales to live.
is there a need to protect the children from being exposed to or subjected to neglect, abuse or family violence?
200 it is implicit in the relief the father seeks from the court on a final basis that he does not feel that the children are at risk in the mother’s care. i am satisfied that there is no evidence to support a finding that the children need to be protected from abuse, neglect or family violence in the mother’s care.
201 it is not the mother’s case that the children are at physical risk from the father.
202 i do accept that the mother has been subjected to family violence as defined by the act as set out earlier in these reasons.
203 i do not find that the children are at an unacceptable risk of harm in the father’s care. i am mindful however of the impact of my finding as to family violence on the current and future relationship and interactions between the mother and the father.
the additional considerations: section 60cc(3)
204 i now address the relevant considerations pursuant to section 60cc(3) of the act in this matter.
any views expressed by the children
205 in circumstances where x gave conflicting answers to the same questions, was easily distracted when unable to play freely and was not able to remain engaged in the interview, it was ms m’s opinion that it was difficult to rely upon any reporting by x. i agree in these circumstances that little weight should be given to any reporting by x having regard to his age and inability to engage in a meaningful manner when questioned by the family report writer. y is too young to express any views.
the nature of the children’s relationship with parent and other significant persons
206 it is not the subject of contest that x’s primary attachment is with his mother, nor is there any dispute that it is in x’s best interests that he continue to live with her.
207 whilst the mother’s affidavit evidence was that the father spent little time with x and did little to assist her in his care, it is conceded by the mother that x has a close and loving relationship with the father. this concession is supported by the family report writer who reported that x and the father appeared comfortable with each other during their joint observation, “displaying affection and warmth between them.”[51] it was clear to ms m that there appeared to be “a very real bond between x and his father, as the quality of the relationship is what is most important. ”[52] i find that x does have a close and loving relationship with the father.
208 y was born subsequent to the separation of the parties. there is no dispute that as between the parties the mother has been almost solely responsible for y’s care and nurturing since birth. it is agreed that y’s primary attachment is to the mother. again there is no dispute that y will continue to live with the mother.
209 there is dispute between the parties as to the relationship y has with the father. it is agreed that at the time of the trial y had seen her father on 11 occasions. the father’s affidavit evidence as to his relationship with y is scant. the father deposes that it was difficult holding y on the occasions she travelled with the mother to victoria as she would start to cry after approximately 30 seconds as “understandably” she does not recognise him.
210 the mother asserts that there is a bond between y and the father. she has observed that y will go to the father, is settled and engages with him. the mother asserts that in contrast, y does not settle with the mother’s friends, even in the mother’s presence. the mother asserts that y recognises the father “....she lets him kiss her, hug her, walk around with her, play with her with her toys.”[53] whilst ms m appropriately conceded that “i haven’t observed the father with the child”, she was of the opinion that y is probably not crying when with the father as she can still see the mother. i accept that this is likely. it is ms m’s opinion that orders for time with y and the father should occur for a period of time with the mother being present. both parties propose that this occur.
211 ms m reported the father remained quiet whilst the writer was meeting and interacting with y and appeared “uncertain and awkward.” from this brief observation the family report writer opined: “undoubtedly, there appears to be no connection, recognition or bond between ms jameson and his daughter, not unexpected given the absence of physical visitation given the geographical distance.”[54]
212 the family report writer did not observe y interacting with the father. in these circumstances i give little weight to the opinion of the family report writer on this subject matter and prefer the direct observational evidence of the mother on the 11 occasions the father has spent time with y in her presence. i do accept that there has been limited face to face interaction between y and the father. i further accept that y’s relationship with the father would not be the same as the close relationship x has with the father given the limited occasions in which they have had the opportunity to interact and therefore bond. i find that the bond between y and the father is in the embryonic stage and developing, but that there is a bond. in circumstances where both parties are of the view, as is ms m, that time between y and the father should occur for a period of time with the mother being present, orders will be made in this regard.
213 whilst the paternal grandmother is on affidavit, there is no evidence as to her relationship with x save for her evidence in cross examination that “ i have a big relationship with x” and that she has observed that x enjoys spending time with her. it is agreed that the parties and x lived in the home of the paternal grandparents from 2016 to 2019 together with the paternal uncle. it is further agreed that the paternal grandmother stayed in the parties’ home from june to september 2020. i accept that x has a relationship with the paternal grandmother although on the evidence i cannot find as to the nature and extent of that relationship.
214 the only written evidence as to the paternal grandmother’s relationship with y is: “we barely have any relationship with y. we have only seen her for brief moments” in cross examination the paternal grandmother stated that she only has “a very small one” with y as she has only seen her 4 times. i accept there is a limited relationship between y and the maternal grandmother.
215 there is no evidence from the paternal grandfather.
216 the maternal aunt’s evidence is that subsequent to the mother and children’s relocation to live with her in new south wales she has assisted in the daily care of both x and y – feeding and changing y and minding her and minding x. she has assisted in all aspects of caring for the children including school delivery and collections, taking them to appointments. she teaches x how to use tools in the garage. this was not challenged in cross examination. i accept that the children have had significant interaction with the maternal aunt since october 2020 in circumstances where they have been living with her in the same house since this time. i find that the maternal aunt is a significant and integral person to each of the children and it is in the children’s best interests that this relationship continue.
217 there is no evidence from the maternal grandmother.
the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with the children
218 this litigation and the interim orders made have taken place in the world of the covid-19 pandemic and the resulting restrictions on travelling. one of the issues that arose during the course of the hearing was whether the father had taken advantage of opportunities to travel to new south wales to spend time with the children. as ms m opined that she was “perplexed why mr jameson has not made more effort to travel to nsw to create opportunities of spending time with y in order to avoid the very long period of time that there has been no physical interaction between them. more worrisome, in the absence of any physical visitation, the opportunities of any visual interaction has not been arranged, which possibly should reflect poorly on both these parents.”[55]
219 when asked was there any reason why he hadn’t come to new south wales to see the children, the father’s response was –  e father] quarantine – quarantine ..... throughout this year, victoria was in lockdown with restrictions, then new south wales, and then victoria again up until this time, the last two fortnights. [counsel for the mother]... is it your evidence that there was no time between separation on 11 september 2020 and now, there was never any point at which you could have travelled from victoria to new south wales to spend time with your children without enduring a lockdown somewhere? [the father] yes, that’s my submission. and in small – if there was any gap between border restrictions of victoria and new south wales and vice versa, that with my workplace i would have to isolate and take two weeks off work for each visit. for that half an hour with y, i would have to take two weeks off work and i’m not – i’m unable to do that. [counsel for the mother] all right. what about for a few days with x or a few days with y, would you take time off for that? [the father] i can’t – i couldn’t afford to take the two weeks off. ... i don’t have leave accrued, ready to go. i’m not able to do that.... but having said that, ms mooney has been freely able to travel as she is following the court order. i am not. [counsel for the mother] right. did you at any point suggest that the order might be amended to permit you to travel in the same way that you say ms mooney could travel? [the father] i didn’t. the orders in place – i didn’t see a problem with the order... [counsel for the mother] so, sir, what i want to suggest to you is this: you expect ms mooney to do whatever ms mooney has to do in order to bring the children to you so that you can spend time with them, do you agree with that? [the father] i expect her to follow the orders. yes, i do. and that’s not for my – just my benefit, it’s for the children to spend time with their father. i don’t think that’s unreasonable. [counsel for the mother] and you can’t think of any other way other than requiring ms mooney to travel to you that that could have been accomplished, is that right? [the father] it could, and i imagine that’s why ms mooney never put an alternative to me because she knew that as well ..... [counsel for the mother] right, but you didn’t put an alternative either, you didn’t suggest anything, did you? [the father] no.[56]
220 this evidence appears to be inconsistent with the evidence of the father that he has flexibility as to the specific hours he works and working from home. this evidence was supported by an affidavit filed on the father’s behalf by ms j who manages the team at the father’s place of employment. this affidavit states that the father has flexibility around early and late starts for work, as well as the capacity to work from home – as the entire team do. there is no evidence as to any requests the father made of his employer to work from home for a period of two weeks so that he could travel to new south wales to spend time with y, or indeed if the father was able to travel to new south wales to spend time with y and x and work in new south wales for some block periods whilst working from new south wales.
221 there is a dispute between the parties that the father did not avail himself of the opportunity to see y on one of the occasions that he did travel to new south wales to see x. i cannot make any finding as to this issue based on the evidence before me.
222 i find that it is the father’s expectation that it is the mother’s responsibility to travel with the children to see him in circumstances where he does not agree with the children and the mother living in new south wales.
the attitude to the children and responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each parent
223 the father alleges that the mother on occasion deliberately attempts to alienate him from x. this manifests itself in several ways including not seeing the children in the holidays, and on the occasions that x has not answered his telephone calls which he described as “negligent”. i am satisfied that it is in the best interests of the children that there be specific times that the parties can contact the children so as to reduce the potential for conflict between the parties.
224 both the mother and maternal aunt were cross examined as to whether x’s phone calls are monitored. both gave consistent evidence that x finds it easier to talk on speakerphone as he likes to move around and do things. i find that his calls are not ‘monitored’ and that it assists x to have his phone calls on speaker phone.
225 ms m reports that the mother had not explored collecting x from school prior to the conclusion of school to ensure he was able to secure a friday night flight to melbourne “despite having no knowledge of what he would miss for the last half hour of schooling for a child in grade 1.” ms m did not identify the foundation of her conclusion that x would only be required to leave school half an hour early so that x’s time with the father could commence on a friday evening rather than a saturday.
226 i am unable to find, on the evidence before me, what time x would have to leave school to be able to catch a flight to arrive in victoria on a friday night at a reasonable hour. i am therefore unable to make a finding as to whether the friday night time not occurring pursuant to the interim orders reflects poorly on the mother’s attitude and responsibilities of parenthood. this no longer appears to be an issue as between the parties in circumstances where both parties formally seek that the children’s time will commence on a friday night if they continue living in new south wales.
227 it was the mother’s evidence that she let x decide y’s name. she did not tell the father this is what she had undertaken. this is not appropriate, both parties should have had the opportunity to decide upon y’s name. it does not reflect well on the mother. it is perhaps reflective of the toxic nature of the parties’ relationship.
228 as between the parties, it is the mother that has undertaken the majority of the responsibility for accompanying x to and from melbourne for his time with the father. she has undertaken all of the responsibility for y to travel to and from melbourne to spend time with the father. the maternal grandmother travelled with x to victoria on 2 occasions. the father has travelled to new south wales to collect x on 2 occasions. for the remainder of the visits, x has travelled as an unaccompanied minor. the father has not travelled to new south wales to spend time with x and y in new south wales. it is the father’s evidence that this is because of the covid travel restrictions including those of his work in the current covid 19 pandemic. it is implicit in this reasoning that once travel restrictions ease the father should be able to travel to new south wales more frequently.
the capacity of each parent to provide for the children’s needs, including emotional and intellectual needs
229 i have found that both parties have at times subsequent to separation failed to prioritise the children’s needs above their own needs or feelings.
230 as to the father, examples of such instances include the father’s conduct at the airport on the 6 march 2021 and his failure to make arrangements and /or enquiries as to his ability to travel to new south wales to spend time with the children.
231 as to the mother, she has not always facilitated time between the children and the father when afforded the opportunity to do so.
232 ms m suggests that the parties undertake several post separation parenting courses which are not objected to by the parties. i will make such orders with a view to assisting the parties in their capacity to separate their own needs from those of the children.
the likely effect of any changes in the children’s circumstances including the effect of any separation from either of the parents or any other person with whom they have been living
233 the mother proposes that the current care and living arrangements for the children continue.
234 the father’s proposed orders will occasion a significant dislocation of both the children and the mother. the children and the mother have lived with, and been supported by, the maternal aunt in a comfortable and secure environment since october 2020, a period of 16 months. y has been living with her mother and maternal aunt for all of her life.
235 the father’s proposal is for the children and the mother to return to an unspecified location in victoria. there is no evidence that x and the mother will be returning to a location in victoria that they are familiar with. y has never lived in victoria. the gravity of the potential change and circumstances for the children should the father’s proposal be adopted by the court is recorded in paragraphs 236 and 278-286 of these reasons.
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with the other parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the children’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
236 pursuant to final property orders made by consent on 22 november 2021, after payment of outstanding matrimonial expenses, the mother received the sum of $86,337.55 and the father received the sum of $42,489.50. there is a splitting order with respect to the father’s superannuation entitlements of $24,208.00 to the mother. there was no evidence before the court as to the monies paid or owing to each of their respective solicitors. in any event the property pool of the parties was modest.
237 having regard to the evidence, i cannot make any findings as to the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with the father in the event that the children and the mother are ordered to relocate to victoria as sought by the father. there is no proposal or evidence before the court as to where such relocation would be. certainly in the event the children and the mother are residing close to the father they would be able to have more regular time with him than if they were residing in a different state. the mother’s evidence, however, is that she could not afford to live in close proximity to the father and that it would have to be somewhere in “regional victoria.”
238 i do not place significant weight on the father’s assertion to ms m in light of the lack of a concrete proposal that he will move to be close to where x attends school.
239 i am unaware as to what the costs of travel will be if the children and mother are living in victoria.
240 it is not clear whether the children living in victoria will impact the frequency with which the children see the father having regard to the lack of specificity in this proposal. i cannot find that an order that the children and mother being ordered to live in victoria will result in the parties living in close proximity to each other.
241 there is little practical evidence as to the expense of the children spending time with the father whilst living in new south wales. the father’s affidavit is silent on this issue. the mother’s evidence in cross examination consisted of her view that the costs of airfare for the father to travel to new south wales would be minimal, maybe $200.00 return. the cost of the father hiring a car the mother estimated to be approximately $220.00. the mother did not know the costs for the father to stay in new south wales whilst spending time with the children. there is no evidence as to the costs the parties have expended to date on travel for the children to spend time with the father. there is some evidence that the cost of a particular flight from city b to melbourne on 19 january 2021 was $109.00.
242 the father does not formally propose that he undertake any of the regular travel for the children to spend time with him should they remain living in new south wales. he does not propose a regime whereby he will travel and spend time with the children in new south wales. he does not propose that he will undertake any of the responsibility for travelling with the children to spend time with him in victoria.
243 the family report writer is clear that the current arrangements for travel for the children are most burdensome on x. i accept that the current arrangements are most burdensome on x, and, will also eventually be burdensome on y. it is not in the children’s best interests that they be required to travel for long periods every fortnight when there are other available options. the most definitive option is for the father to undertake some of the travel burden and not have it all fall on the children, irrespective of where they are residing. it is in the children’s best interests that the parents adopt some of the burden of travel irrespective of where they are living.
244 it is agreed on either party’s proposal that the children remaining in new south wales will mean that the children will not be able to spend regular midweek time with the father, unless he travels to new south wales for this to occur. it is further agreed between the parties that the graduating regime for y will not be able to occur as frequently if the children remain living in new south wales.
245 both parties agree that in the event the mother and children remain living in new south wales they should share in the costs of travel for x. whilst there is scant evidence, it is clear that there will be financial costs involved with travel should the children be residing in a different state.
246 it is also clear that the children living in a different state will impact the regularity of time they are able to spend with the father. i am not satisfied however that the tyranny of distance will substantially affect the children’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with the father. the children will still be able to see the father on a regular basis during school terms dependant on whether the father elects to travel to new south wales and for block periods of time during school holidays. y will still be able to see her father on a graduating basis. the children will still be able to communicate with the father regularly via facetime/telephone time. whilst this is not optimal, it still maintains the relationship for x and i am satisfied will still promote y having a relationship with the father.
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the children
247 it is clear that it is preferable to make orders that will be least likely to lead to further conflict and disagreement between the parties and possibly the institution of further parenting proceedings between the parties. i accept ms m’s opinion that “these parents should not underestimate the vulnerability of a child who is exposed to or senses any conflictual behaviour. even for a very young child, if exposed to stress in their parents and between their parents, that leads to unpredictability and uncertainty in care-giving, then this can undermine the development of secure attachment to both parents at this most critical developmental stage for foundations for life. ”[57]
248 the lack of any specific evidence as to where the mother would relocate to should she be ordered to return to victoria with the children raises a significant risk that the parties would undertake further litigation in the near future once the practical circumstances of the mother’s court ordered move became a reality for the parties. it would be preferable for the children and the parties that this family not be further involved in the trauma of litigation. i am satisfied that there is a greater risk of further litigation between the parties were this court to order that the children and the mother reside in victoria.
249 having regard to my findings as to the toxic and conflictual nature of the relationship of these parties, i find that it will be in the children’s best interests to make orders that are as prescriptive as reasonably possible so as to decrease the possibility for future conflict as to the parenting arrangements of the children. i will therefore make orders regulating specific times that the children speak with the father and where changeovers are to occur rather than such arrangements being as agreed to between the parties.
parental responsibility
250 each of the parties seeks an order that there be equal shared parental responsibility for the children.
251 as i have found that the father has engaged in family violence by way of coercive and controlling behaviour, the presumption as to equal shared parental responsibility does not apply in this matter.
252 even if i had not found that the father had engaged in family violence, i am satisfied that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in this matter would be rebutted as not being in the best interests of the children.
253 both parties agree that they do not have a cooperative relationship and there has been conflict post separation. ms m opines: “certainly, the parents continued to present their views from their own perspective, as they demonstrated limited communication as the parental conflict has persisted, with significant disagreement and discord, both prior and post separation.”[58] she further reports: “disappointingly, neither parent was able to recognise the value to their children to improve goodwill between them. they do not appear to be confident to engage in any direct communication, as they continue to struggle to find solutions and reach agreements...”[59] ms m further describes the relationship between the parties as “riddled with conflict.” i accept that the parties’ relationship post separation is as described by ms m.
254 the emails from the father to the mother post separation are riddled with references to the upcoming court proceedings and laced with threats and intimidation. during the course of the father’s evidence he did not express any insight into the potential effect of such communications upon the mother and felt that they were appropriate and reasonable communications between parents.  unsel for the mother]: do you think that using a title of inappropriate lies to x was a reasonable title? [the father]: i- i think it was pretty accurate of the situation. i don’t perceive it – i mean, i haven’t used any colourful language in the email, i haven’t threatened, i haven’t swore. i haven’t – i don’t think i did anything inappropriate in that email, no. [counsel for the mother] okay: absolute disgusting behaviour on your part. same answer? [the father]: i- i think it – it was, yes. [counsel for the mother]: yes. okay: you can pay for me to take him back to you seeing as how you’ve conveniently saved yourself a few hundred dollars by not travelling. same answer? [the father]: well, that – that’s- that’s absolutely accurate, yes. [counsel for the mother]: yes? [the father]: it’s true. [counsel for the mother]: this is what you want to go on the record with. are you sure that’s the stance you want to – same answer? [the father]: yes. yes.
255 ms m reports that the father demonstrated “little insight into how he may have contributed to the difficulties in the parental relationship.”[60]
256 the mother’s evidence that she finds the father’s emails to be inflammatory, hostile and upsetting was not challenged in cross examination. i accept this is so.
257 despite her views ms m proposes the parents share equal parental responsibility for the children. she gave oral evidence that she is “hopeful” that the parties can develop a cooperative parenting relationship. when asked by myself as to how she thought that this change would come about given the parties’ presentations during the interview process, ms m’s evidence was that: “it’s in the hope that once these matters are resolved that they’re able to shift their focus to being good co-parents. but i do believe they will need the support of an expert third professional to navigate everything else that’s going to be involved in their co-parenting relationship...i certainly wouldn’t have confidence for them to do it themselves...”[61]
258 the father indicated during cross examination that he would like to be able to communicate better. he asserted he has always done his best to communicate effectively with the mother and suggested that he would prefer to be able to speak to her over the phone, however communication is not assisted by the mother as she has suggested her preferred method of communication is via email.
259 the mother also indicated during the course of cross examination a desire to improve the parties’ situation. when asked how she could improve it, the mother said that she would call the father and speak to him about issues more. having regard however to the tone and tenor of the father’s correspondence to the mother, i am not satisfied that verbal communication between the parties will assist them in establishing a joint parenting relationship. i am further not satisfied in light of my findings as to family violence that the mother should have to engage in this form of communication with the father.
260 i invited submissions from each of the parties as to how, in light of the evidence, the parties would be able to communicate effectively so as to jointly make decisions regarding the children.
261 the father submitted that the parties are keen to try to develop a better cooperative parenting style and the court should give them the benefit of that opportunity.
262 although the mother did not formally resile from seeking an order as to the allocation of joint parental responsibility, it was submitted on her behalf that it is the mother’s view that the father has engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour both during the course of the relationship and post separation. the mother submitted that the father’s actions post separation including the emails and videoing taping incident at the airport, together with the orders sought by him requiring the children to relocate with the mother to victoria are a continuum of this pattern of behaviour and is “not a good predictor of these parties’ ability to exercise equal shared parental responsibility, if the mother takes the view – as she does, that she is being effectively held to ransom by the father’s desire to control her movement..”[62] this submission appears to be predicated on the mother being ordered to relocate with the children back to victoria.
263 in this matter there is a high level of conflict between the parties. they do not have a cooperative relationship. the communication from the father to the mother has to date been unhelpful and not conducive to the parties’ relationship evolving into one that is cooperative and child focused. there is a significant level of distrust between the parties. whilst the parties and the family report writer are ‘hopeful’ that this will change, it is difficult for the court to determine what third party assistance could be afforded to these parties to improve their parenting relationship to such an extent that they are able to communicate effectively and reach joint decisions especially having regard to my finding as to family violence.
264 it is of course hoped that once the spectre of litigation between the parties is finalised that this will assist in their parental relationship moving forward. i am not satisfied at this stage that the parties will be able to consult and make a genuine effort to reach agreement about long term issues regarding the children in a meaningful and cooperative manner. i find that there is a risk that the conflictual nature of the parties’ relationship will be exacerbated by a requirement that they mutually make decisions about the long term welfare of the children. it is not in the best interests of the children to increase the likelihood and cause for conflict between the parties, accepting ms m’s opinion that “...the only childhood stress greater than having two married parents who fight all the time is having two divorced parents who fight all the time. these parents should not underestimate the potential risks to their child should they fail to protect both children from their ongoing disputes and tensions.”[63]
265 i am satisfied that, as the uncontested resident parent, the mother should have sole parental responsibility for making decisions as to the long term care and welfare of the children.
266 as an order for sole parental responsibility has been made, i need not turn to s 65daa of the act. i am to make such orders in my discretion that are in the best interests of the children as a result of the relevant considerations in section 60cc of the act above.
discussion
267 ms m’s report and oral evidence provided the court with her opinions as to the importance of the development of attachments between children and their parents and how this might best be accomplished. she agreed that the optimal outcome for x and y would be for the parents to live in reasonably close proximity with each other (and to co-operate with each other and co-parent in an effective manner).
268 ms m opined that “attachment theory maintains that a child’s ability to form and maintain healthy intimate relationships across the life span depends on the child having a close and consistent relationship with its parent during infancy and childhood...” [64]
269 she disputed the premise when put to her by counsel for the father that she does not agree that the relationship between the children can continue with the mother living in new south wales and the father in victoria.   m] i wouldn’t say i don’t agree with it. what i- what i need to always say to parents is that it’s obviously not going to be the best outcome for children. there are many situations where that does occur, and it occurs for good reasons- reasons for the court to determine, not for me......you know, the key factor is making sure there is a constant visual....so distance in itself shouldn’t be seen as the – you know, don’t automatically assume there’s going to be no relationship between child and parent.[65]
270 i accept this evidence.
271 ms m did not support an arrangement for the children where they experience separation from the father for any “extended periods of time.”
272 based upon her opinion as to the current relationship that exists between x and the father and x’s age, ms m was of the view that, as x has a secure attachment with the father from his childhood, maintaining a relationship with the father with that sense of security and attachment if x were to remain living in new south wales is “developmentally something that x can do, but something that y cannot do at her age, and so this is why the problem with relocation for babies is so difficult.”[66]
273 ms m’s evidence is that for y, the developmental process of attachment to her father requires a constant visual narrative.“ but developmental process of attachment...you need regularity. the regularity is around the child measuring reliance on having the experience of the responses from that parent often enough and consistently enough that i can predict it, and you need a lot of time for that. you need time with – let’s start by three times a week.”[67] she opined that, in light of the absence of physical visitation between y and the father, time would need to be introduced gently, regularly and often, for short periods of time and be at all times consistent with her age and development. i accept this opinion and so find. whilst stating that it’s difficult to estimate overnight time with the father, she reported that “as she comes to tolerate greater periods of separation from her mother, this would support two hours becoming three and then four, with the expectation that she could spend overnight time with the father by three years of age.”[68] whilst both parties propose that y commence overnight time with the father sometime during her second year, i accept ms m’s opinion that this should not commence until y is 3 years of age.
274 ms m opines in her written report that: “the current arrangements for x are not sustainable and appear to be heavily burdened on the most vulnerable family member, the child.”[69] for her, the issue for x was the effect of travel on him. surprisingly, despite ms m’s view, both parents propose that in the event the children and the mother remain living in new south wales, the children will be undertaking the majority of the travel to see the father.
275 ms m stated in her oral evidence:   m] i think, with children with special needs, that travel is very difficult, and maintaining that kind of regular burden of-of transition being very long- it’s not a quick transition. even if both parents lived in victoria, and they were – one was in city ee and one was region ff, we would still have problems. they don’t tolerate well travel, and whilst it can be exciting to begin with, what people don’t understand is that they build intolerance to it over time. so it might be something we don’t see for the period that it’s living in court, but beyond court, i can- absolutely becomes a really significant factor.[70]
276 i accept ms m’s opinion. i find that any orders made will need to reduce the effect that travelling has on x should he remain living in new south wales or indeed in victoria in circumstances where there is no evidence as to how far apart the parties would end up residing in victoria.
277 whilst i have not accepted ms m’s opinion that there is no relationship between y and the father, i do accept her opinion that for y, having regard to her age, a strong attachment between herself and the father will require in the short term regularity in the father attending to regular caring tasks for her. the difficulty is the practical way in which this can occur having regard to the parties’ proposals.
the father’s proposal
278 as referred to earlier in these reasons, the orders sought by the father do not specify at all the geographical location in which the children and the mother are to reside other than “in victoria.”
279 it is the mother’s unchallenged evidence that if it is ordered that she and the children are to reside in victoria:- she will be required to rent a 3 bedroom home as it is important that x has his own bedroom, she will need to purchase items including furniture, white goods and other household items at an estimated cost of $15,000.00, the mother has searched for three bedroom rental properties in both suburb e (where the father deposes he lives) and suburb gg (where the mother thinks the father is living with his current partner), she has been unable to find any rental properties in suburb e, and there are limited 3 bedroom properties in suburb gg, the average rental price for such properties being approximately $580.00 per week.
280 the mother deposes that based on her current income and expenses she anticipates she will be able to afford the sum of $250.00 per week by way of rent. the mother asserts that rental properties in the surrounding suburbs of both suburb e and suburb gg are therefore not within her budget.
281 the mother was cross examined briefly as to her financial circumstances. the mother: agreed that she receives approximately $930.00 per week including rental assistance, was not moved on her assertion that she could only afford $250.00 a week on rent as she would have to pay bills including utilities, groceries, petrol and car maintenance in addition to rent, confirmed she pays the sum of $300.00 per week currently for rent and board, stated that she would accept further funds from the father, and deposed that she would have approximately $15,000.00 to $20,000.00 left over from her property settlement after payment of her legal fees which would assist her to get started.
282 i accept the mother’s uncontested evidence. i find that her costs to establish herself in victoria would utilise a significant proportion of the monies she is to receive by way of final property settlement. i find that she can afford rent in victoria in the sum of $250.00 per week. in the event that i ordered that the father pay the sum of $100.00 to the mother each week (accepting for the moment that this court has the power to do so in the circumstances of this matter) i find that the mother could afford the sum of $350.00 per week for as long as such extra sum was paid by the father upon the basis that the monies received by the mother continue at their current rate. i cannot be satisfied of this in circumstances where the father was unable to provide a definitive answer to the question of whether he would, in the event he was to pay the mother the sum of $100.00 per week, make an application to the child support agency for a non-periodic payment credit or seek a review having regard to the costs of his spending time with the children.
283 in any event, the weekly figure the mother may be able to afford for rent assists me little. there is no evidence before the court as to what properties are available for rent in victoria at all, let alone for the sum of $250.00 - $350.00.
284 there is no evidence as to what support networks there are available for x in the suburb the mother would be relocating to should this court order that she and the children live in victoria. there is no evidence as to schools, medical practitioners and support networks for the mother. there is no evidence as to how close such available properties are to where the father is currently residing.
285 the father appears to try and ameliorate this significant lack of evidence by advising ms m that “if he was required to live independently near to ms mooney in victoria, to be near their choice of school for x, he would do so in order to be an active and hands on father.”[71] there is no evidence from the father as to his capacity to “move somewhere near the mother” and how this would impact for example on his current employment.
286 having regard to the findings made as to family violence, i find that the mother would not be assisted in her parenting capacity by requiring her to relocate and live in reasonable proximity to someone who has occasioned family violence.
287 there are thus significant unresolved questions as to the children’s ability to have a meaningful relationship with the father if they were ordered to live in victoria. i find that so ordering will not necessarily result in the parties living in close proximity to each other. i find that requiring the parties to live in close proximity to each other is not in the best interests of the children having regard to the finding of family violence and the nature of the parties’ relationship.
288 in circumstances where the father seeks that the uncontested resident parent of the children be required to live in a state not of her choosing, the court must address the mother’s capacity to meet the needs of the children if she is ordered to live in victoria with the children as against her capacity to provide for those needs should she be able to continue living in new south wales. the availability of family support, including the provision of reliable child-care, to a residential parent who lives a long distance from the non-residential parent is usually an important consideration: see mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405.
289 the father does not seek an order that the children live with him should the mother continue to live in new south wales. the criticism the father raises as to the mother’s ability to meet the needs of the children is his view that her actions have been designed to alienate him from the children. i have found that the mother has on occasion not promoted the relationship between the children and the father. to her credit, on reflection, she has realised that these decisions were not good decisions. the father does not assert that the mother is otherwise unable to meet the needs of the children should they remain living in new south wales.
290 the father accepts that the mother is “very opposed” to relocating back to victoria. he accepts that the mother says she wishes to remain living in new south wales where she has family support. to the proposition that her family support was “ not essential ” in cross examination, the mother replied: e mother] kind of is. i relied on my sister quite a bit to help me, yes. [counsel for the father] yes. but you could do it without her. or are you saying you couldn’t do it without her? [the mother] saying i couldn’t. [counsel for the father] okay.[72]
291 the mother was asked as to her capacity to move to victoria.  unsel for the father] are you saying to her honour that you wouldn’t be able to come down here? [the mother] i would try it, yes. i don’t know what it would be like, because i haven’t had to be on my own with the kids. [counsel for the father] okay. do you think you-you could make it work? [the mother] i could try, yes.[73]
292 to the suggestion that the mother was able to care for x on her own in victoria without her family after the parties moved back from new south wales the mother’s reply was telling “yes. i had mr jameson.” the mother was clear that she was able to manage caring for x at that time as she had the assistance of the father.
293 the father has conceded and recognised that at times the mother has needed extra family support – twice with her family – and once when the father was in isolation when the paternal grandmother moved into the home to assist the mother as she was “not really coping that well... she did appear to be struggling” the father however, does not accept that the mother’s support network in new south wales is superior to that which would be afforded to her in victoria. the father stated in cross examination: “she has got a big network down here, and as well as the extended family who i was growing up with down here and spent four years living in their house. so like i said, yes, and the answer is the support would be absolutely equivalent if not more, but it would be different support.”[74]
294 what support then is available for the mother in victoria, noting that there is no evidence as to how far away from the father or the paternal family the mother and children will be living?
295 i have found that the parties have a toxic and conflictual post separation parenting relationship. i accept that that the mother being forced to live in a state not of her choosing on the father’s application will do little to assist in the improvement of this relationship. in any event, there is little evidence before the court as to the reality of the support the father would be able to provide to the mother on a practical basis in circumstances where there is no evidence as to how far apart the parties will be residing if the mother were to relocate back to victoria, save for the father’s assertion to the family report writer that he will move near to where the mother is living.
296 the tenor of the cross examination of the mother was that the mother would have the support of the paternal grandmother were the mother and children living in victoria. the mother was cross examined as to her relationship with the paternal grandmother and it was put to the mother that the paternal grandmother treated the mother as a daughter. the mother’s response was clear: “it’s not how my mum treats me, no.” the mother deposes that the paternal grandmother would override her parenting decisions. the paternal grandmother conceded that it was possible that if the mother told x to do something she would say not to worry about it, that “grandma will do it.”
297 it is not contested that the relationship between the mother and the paternal grandmother is currently fractured. whilst the mother’s oral evidence was that she would like to repair the relationship, the paternal grandmother’s affidavit did not contain any positive views that she has as to the mother, rather it was riddled with criticisms:
while unfortunately the mother lacked motivation to obtain employment when the mother was caring for x she would often place him into childcare and simply rest and sit at home not doing much. from time to time the mother held down part time jobs, but only for months at a time. ...the mother rarely interacted with x in a way that was productive. the mother did not wash, cook or clean but i was happy to assist... the mother has no proposal for y to have a relationship with the paternal family...
298 i accept and find that the mother and paternal grandmother have a fractured relationship. i find that the paternal grandmother is critical of the mother. i find that the mother feels that the paternal grandmother undermines her parenting decisions.
299 the father submits that the mother has friends in victoria and “makes friends easily.” the mother being asked in cross examination to name some friends she has in victoria does not lead me to find that she has a large or significant or indeed any support network in victoria. it was further submitted on the father’s behalf that it “is significant that the parties got married down here [victoria]”. there is no evidence as to why the parties were married in victoria. i place little weight on this.
300 ms m didn’t feel that the mother is more vulnerable in victoria “on the basis that her mother is no longer there, which is the only reason she told me that she needed to be there.” i place little weight on this opinion in circumstances where i have found that the mother is heavily reliant upon the support network she has had in new south wales since september 2020, most notably her sister, ms l. further ms m did not engage with the allegations as to family violence or the financial circumstances of the mother.
301 i find that the mother has a need and requires both emotional and practical support to care for the two children, one with special needs and one of a very young age. i find that those needs are met by her where she currently resides with her family in new south wales. this will benefit the children.
302 i find that those needs would not be met in victoria. i find that the mother will have far more limited, if any, material support available to her in victoria. she has a conflictual relationship with the father. he has occasioned family violence. her relationship with the paternal grandmother, whose affidavit evidence with respect to the mother is only critical, is currently fractured.
303 i find that the nature and quality of the support available to the mother and children in victoria in no way equates to that which the mother and children will continue to enjoy should she continue to live in new south wales where most of her family live. i do not accept the father’s submission that the mother is not more vulnerable in victoria than she is in new south wales.
304 the mother was questioned about her views as to whether the father would be happy if he moved to new south wales. she was then cross examined about her own happiness:  unsel for the father] so ms m also goes on to say that you – even though you understand the impact of not being in melbourne near mr jameson, the children not being in melbourne near mr jameson, you understand that that’s an impact for your children, and i think you do. you’re saying that. you’re making a call about the fact that that’s not as important as you – your getting support and your happiness in new south wales, is that right? [the mother] no. it’s not just my support and happiness. how am i supposed to look after them if i can’t look after myself as well? that’s why ‑ ‑ ‑ [counsel for the father] but, ms mooney, you can. come on. you’re telling her honour you can’t look after yourself? [the mother] i haven’t been doing that very well, no. that’s why i see a psychologist. [counsel for the father] okay. ms m says even though you understand that it’s not, you know, ideal for your children or there’s an impact on them, you still propose to stay up there, that’s right ‑ ‑ ‑? [the mother] yes.[75]
305 this was a line of enquiry pursued on the father’s instructions. the nature of questions of this character and content reflect the father’s attitude and capacities. it has never been part of the father’s case that he ought to change his living arrangements and circumstances for the benefit of the children to continue living in new south wales. i accept the integrity of the mother’s response to this line of questioning. this exchange is reflective of the rigid approach the father has taken to the parenting of the children post separation.
306 the mother was cross examined at length about the effect of the separation on the children from the paternal family. this is certainly a continuing issue if the children remain living in new south wales. if the parties lived in reasonable proximity to each other in victoria, then they may be able to see their father and the extended paternal family more regularly than they do now.
307 the parties living in close proximity to each other would accord with the family report writer’s opinions as to the advantages and importance for both x and y but especially y, of having a constant visual narrative with the father.
308 it would support the development of y’s embryonic relationship with the father as time could occur for short periods of time but regularly as recommended by the family report writer.
309 time could occur both during the week and on weekends. the father would have the ability to attend school and extracurricular activities the children were engaged in.
310 these advantages would in the normal course be weighed against the disadvantages of the children and mother relocating and then the advantages and disadvantages of the children and the mother living in new south wales must be weighed and considered.
311 all these advantages presupposes as discussed previously, that if the children and mother are ordered to relocate to victoria that they will be living in close proximity to each other. i have found that there is no evidence before the court that this is the case.
312 thus, the advantages of the children and the mother living in victoria must be seen in this context.
the mother’s proposal
313 the ability of the children to have and maintain a relationship with the father in the event the children continue to live in new south wales is a significant issue. it is clear that in the event the children continue to reside in new south wales with the mother they will be unable to see their father mid-week, and y’s graduating time with the father will not be as regular as it would be if the parties lived in reasonable proximity to each other.
314 it is uncontested that x has and continues to have a close relationship with the father in circumstances where he has lived in a different state since september 2020.
315 the mother was reported by ms m as unable to demonstrate how she would support x’s close and continuing relationship with the father if she remained in new south wales as she proposes limited time. the family report writer was critical of the mother not recognising the disruption and disconnection from extended family members, friends and the broader community, especially in light of x’s special needs. “more worrisome is no clear plan for the formulation of a clear and reliable bond for y with her father who has been unwilling to travel to nsw to spend time with his daughter.” the mother deposes her willingness to, and seeks orders, that she continue to travel to melbourne with y to facilitate y’s time with the father until the year 2025. the mother was cross examined about her proposal that y travel down to melbourne to visit the father once a month, a month being a long gap.  unsel for the father] have you thought about that? and does that worry you that it will be hard for her to remember who he is? [the mother] yes. [counsel for the father] okay. well, if that’s the case, why wouldn’t you bring her down more often? [the mother] because i think i would like for mr jameson – mr jameson to share in the travel also. [counsel for the father] okay. so the reason is you think he should come up there in the other weekend? [the mother] yes.
316 in sharp juxtaposition, ms m did not materially engage in the same enquiry of the father. she did not criticise the father for not recognising the disruption and disconnections of the mother’s family members, friends and the broader community should the children be ordered to relocate to victoria in circumstances where one child has special needs and one child is an infant. she does not engage in any meaningful manner with the reality that her recommendations will remove a mother who is heavily reliant upon family support to assist her in these circumstances to be displaced to an unknown area that they have never lived in, with no support- save potentially, for someone who has occasioned family violence and a mother in law who is, in her affidavit, only critical of her. she does not address what capacity the children would have to see their extended maternal family. the tone and tenor of the family report that the burden for ensuring the children maintain a relationship with the father rests with the mother “whether she is in nsw or victoria, given the father has limited opportunity for physical time with y, the mother must do everything possible to ensure the father maintains a significant role in the child’s life.” i find that these deficiencies in her evaluation undermine her recommendations.
317 whilst the mother expressed a desire to support the children having a meaningful relationship with the father, i find that on occasions she has not availed herself of opportunities to support this relationship. these included the time she spent a weekend in melbourne whilst x was with the father and did not respond to his requests to see y reporting “i had other plans” and that she insisted x be returned on the sunday evening when the monday was a public holiday. the mother conceded to ms m that they were not good decisions on her behalf.
318 the mother was further cross examined as to why it took her 12 hours to tell the father about y’s birth:- unsel for the father] why did you take all day – 12 hours – to tell him his daughter was born?... [the mother]: i had her and then i was going through the process of whether or not i would stay in hospital, whether or not i didn’t stay in hospital. we left the hospital about six hours after she was born, so i was getting home, introducing x, getting comfortable after i just spent all night in labour, and then i called him as soon as everything had calmed down. [counsel for the father]: ms mooney, do you think that he would have been hurt by the fact that it took 12 hours to be told that his baby had been born? [the mother]: i don’t know. i told him the day she was, so i’m not sure. [counsel for the father]: it’s a bit hard, isn’t it? bit hard-nosed? [the mother]: no, i was a bit busy.[76]
319 i find that the mother’s actions in this regard were entirely reasonable in the circumstances. such cross examination does the father little credit.
320 the family report writer’s evidence is that the mother’s own estranged relationship with her father caused a feeling of abandonment by him. the mother did not want that for her own children. ms m’s oral evidence is that the mother was clear to her that she wanted the children to have a relationship with the father, she was in “no doubt” that the mother did not want the same burden for her children that she has by not having a relationship with her own father. on balance, i find that the mother, despite some actions post separation that have not been child focused, has the capacity and the desire to foster a relationship between the children and the father were they to remain living in new south wales.
321 if the children remain living in new south wales then they will not have the benefit of both parents being able to attend all their sporting and other extracurricular events. it is not certain as to whether this could be achieved should the children live in victoria. as put to the mother in cross examination, the children having to travel to victoria will result in them missing out on weekend activities such as club or school sport. this is especially so if the children are travelling interstate each alternate weekend as proposed by the father. i am satisfied that the travel the children are required to undertake must be minimised as much as possible, and that it is in their best interests that the father shoulder some of this burden.
x’s surname
322 the father opposes the mother’s application that x’s surname be changed from “jameson” to “jameson-mooney.” the welfare of x is the paramount consideration in deciding this issue: in the marriage of fooks & mccarthy [1993] famca 117, (1994) flc 92-450. the full court in chapman and palmer [1978] famca 86, (1978) flc 90-510 at 77,675 – 77,676, [1978] famca 86 at [56] provided the following guidance:
to summarise, the factors to which the courts should have regard in determining whether there should be any change in the surname of a child include the following: the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration, the short and long term effects of any change in the child’s surname, any embarrassment likely to be experienced by the child if its name is different from that of the parent with custody or care and control. any confusion of identity which may arise for the child if his or her name is changed or is not changed. the effect which any change in surname may have on the relationship between the child and the parent whose name the child bore during the marriage. the effect of frequent or random changes of name.
323 the parties agree that y’s name is hyphenated to incorporate both the mother and father’s surnames. the father’s affidavit is silent as to y’s surname and the circumstances surrounding it. it was put to the father in cross examination that he saw on the sample of the birth certificate provided to him by the mother that y’s name was hyphenated. the father said that he did not recall, but “it could have happened.” i do not accept this. the selection of a child’s surname is an important issue. the father has been very vocal in advising the mother of arrangements and circumstances he does not agree with. there is no evidence that at any stage he or his legal representatives have sought that y’s name be changed or advised the mother that they did not agree with her name being hyphenated. i accept on balance that the father was aware of this proposal and consented to the hyphenation of y’s name to incorporate the surname of both parties.
324 the father sees no positives in changing x’s surname in circumstances where he feels it would be confusing, irresponsible and a stress that he does not need. the father concedes that x might wonder why he had a different name to his sister but feels that he and the mother could explain the reason why to him, although he would have to think about what that explanation would entail.
325 the mother was not cross examined in any meaningful way as to her application that x’s surname be changed so as to be the same as y’s.
326 ms m’s evidence was that she likes children to have the same surname if possible. she does not think that x’s special needs will be a problem in his surname being changed. i accept this evidence.
327 i am satisfied it is in the children’s best interests to have the same surname. in circumstances where i am satisfied that the father consented to y having a hyphenated surname incorporating both the parties’ surnames, x’s surname should be changed to accord with y’s and an order will be made accordingly.
ancillary orders sought
328 both parties seek a raft of ancillary orders. for the most part, there was little evidence to support such orders and/or no cross examination with respect to same. submissions made by each of the parties focused very much on the issue of relocation.
329 in circumstances where there was no submissions as to the allocation of the responsibility of the costs of travel for each of parties to comply with orders as to the children’s time with the father, i will make an order that each party will be responsible for their own costs of travel.
330 orders were sought by the father that each party keep the other advised at all times as to their current telephone number and residential address. again there was no evidence to support this and no submissions made. i will make an order as to the provision of the telephone numbers to assist the children with telephoning the parties in accordance with the orders. i decline to make an order as to the provision of residential addresses in circumstances where changeover of the children will not occur at either of the party’s homes and in light of my findings as to family violence.
331 i have made ancillary orders to ensure that the children have the benefit of both parents being provided with appropriate information as to their progress and circumstances as i find this to be in the children’s best interests.
332 whilst again there were no submissions made, i am satisfied having regard to my findings as to the nature of the relationship between the parties that it is in the children’s best interests that orders be made regulating the parties’ behaviour including a restraint on them discussing these proceedings in the presence of the children.
conclusion
333 the gravamen of the dispute in this case is the balancing of the children maintaining a meaningful relationship with both parents as against the right for a party to live where they choose in circumstances where the mother is the uncontested resident parent irrespective of where she and the children live.
334 i am satisfied that the mother’s desire to remain living in new south wales where she has the support of her family is genuine. the mother and the father have had, post separation, a conflict ridden parental relationship. the relationship of the mother and paternal grandmother is fractured. i am satisfied that the mother has greater emotional and practical support in new south wales than she would have if she were to live in victoria. i place significant weight on this.
335 the mother’s application will continue the living arrangements for herself and the children that they have had since october 2020. the father’s proposal is not founded on practical proposals or well researched. there is no evidence before the court as to where the children and the mother would be able to reasonably live should they be ordered to relocate back to victoria.
336 the father does not propose to relocate to live in new south wales to be closer to the children. i am satisfied that the mother will be unhappy should be she have to relocate to victoria. i am satisfied that there is a strong possibility that the mother will not be able to cope with the children in victoria as the parent primarily responsible for the children, especially having regard to x’s special needs and y’s tender age. she has not had to parent these children without some form of family support to date. i attach significant weight to this in circumstances where the mother is the uncontested resident parent.
337 i am satisfied that the mother’s only material, emotional practical support as the parent with whom these children will live, is in new south wales. this attracts significant weight. additionally, the mother’s financial circumstances in new south wales have a flavour of security by way of living in her mother’s home with her sister. in victoria she and the children are likely to be confronted by unknown financial circumstances and social isolation.
338 the children will not be spending as regular time with the father as they would if the parties were able to live in close proximity of each other. however again, i am not satisfied as to the time the children would be reasonably able to spend with the father on a practical basis were they to live in victoria.
339 whilst not optimal, i find that in all the circumstances it is possible for both of the children’s relationships to continue with the father with them continuing to live in new south wales. this will depend in some part on the father’s motivation to travel to new south wales to see the children as i have taken into account the family report writer’s opinion as to the burden on x of constant travel.
340 having regard to the young age of x together with his special needs and y’s very young age, the time and method of time between the children and the father will need to be closely managed. i have carefully considered the recommendations of the family report writer as to the appropriate staging of time between y and the father, and will make orders that adopt her recommendations as to the developmentally and age appropriate staging of time between y and the father.
341 the circumstances of this matter are such that it is not in the best interests of the children to order that the mother and children live in victoria.
342 orders are made accordingly.
