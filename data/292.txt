“section 50 of the evidence act” schedules
a) served on each other party a copy of the summary that discloses the name and address of the person who prepared the summary, and b). given each other party a reasonable opportunity to examine or copy the documents in question.
b). given each other party a reasonable opportunity to examine or copy the documents in question.
"there are three matters to be determined for the purposes of the s 50 application: whether the relevant spreadsheets and tables are summaries of information contained in the underlying documents for the purposes of s 50 (rather than, for example, comprising conclusions or statements of opinion), whether the volume and/or complexity of the underlying documents is such that it would not otherwise be possible conveniently to examine the evidence, and whether a reasonable opportunity has been given to any other party to the litigation to examine or copy the documents in question (and in that regard the fact that there might between now and the trial be a reasonable opportunity to examine or copy the documents is strictly not to the point)."
“what is here sought to be adduced, to prove a lengthy series of payments and the details relating to such payments, are spreadsheets in which details of each of the payments are listed. those are the primary facts identified in the documents for which the documents would otherwise be sought to be tendered and what the summary table then contains is the aggregate of the amounts in question. insofar as a calculation of the total sum of amounts of such payments represents a summing up of the primary facts, it is submitted that this is within the scope of a "summary" for the purposes of s 50 (provided the calculation is able to be objectively determined from specified primary facts). i think there is force in that submission. provided that the calculation of the total sum does not require the application of any opinion or judgment as to what amounts are to comprised in the calculation, but on its face is simply an arithmetical exercise, i would admit the whole of the summary table as a summary. (the relevant difference i see between the summary tables here sought to be adduced - which list amounts extracted from the underlying documents and simply add up those amounts - and the schedule in beattie is that there an element of judgment was involved in the calculation of some or all of the amounts then added or subtracted to reach the total sum and, in relation to the invoice charges, it seems that the schedule did not contain the component charges then added together but simply the result of the addition.) if i were to be wrong on this, however, then the balance of the summary tables would nevertheless be admissible as a summary and the last line (containing a total of the amounts in the previous entries) would be read as a submission (and that is how i would have treated them).”
“however, questions of fact and degree are involved. there must be a point at which the level of exercise of any judgment or subjective opinion in the formulation of the alleged summary means that what is really being adduced is not, in fact, a true summary of the contents of two or more documents. in some cases the determination of this may be a matter of form rather than substance.”

the law
the jurisdictional facts  on both the husband’s and the wife’s case, the parties’ relationship commenced around the end of 2010. the husband maintained that, at that time, he was spending the majority of the nights on a weekly basis with the wife at the b street, town c property, sharing that residence with her, notwithstanding that he did not move there on a fulltime basis until about may 2013. the court accepts that there was a mutual commitment to a shared relationship by december 2010. (b) on both the husband’s and the wife’s case, the parties’ relationship broke down in 2018, in around august 2018 on the wife’s evidence and in november 2018 on the husband’s evidence. little turns on that 3 month differential and the court accepts that the parties’ relationship had broken down at least by the beginning of december 2018. (c) the parties’ relationship was one that meets the definition of a “defacto relationship as prescribed by s.4aa of the act. (d) the de facto relationship, therefore, existed for “at least 2 years”, with the actual length of time being in the order of some 8 years from about december 2010 to december 2018. (e) the parties were, ordinarily, resident in the state of new south wales during the course of their de-facto relationship.   on both the husband’s and the wife’s case, the parties’ relationship broke down in 2018, in around august 2018 on the wife’s evidence and in november 2018 on the husband’s evidence. little turns on that 3 month differential and the court accepts that the parties’ relationship had broken down at least by the beginning of december 2018.

the approach to be taken
third, whether making a property settlement order is "just and equitable" is not to be answered by beginning from the assumption that one or other party has the right to have the property of the parties divided between them or has the right to an interest in marital property which is fixed by reference to the various matters (including financial and other contributions) set out in s 79(4). the power to make a property settlement order must be exercised "in accordance with legal principles, including the principles which the act itself lays down"[28]. to conclude that making an order is "just and equitable" only because of and by reference to various matters in s 79(4), without a separate consideration of s 79(2), would be to conflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles laid down by the act.
1. identify and value, as at the date of hearing, the parties’ property, liabilities and financial resources, 2. identify and assess the contributions (“the first limb – the contribution factors”) of the parties and express them as a percentage of the net value of the property (examined on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach, depending on the circumstances of the case), 3. identify and assess the other factors relevant (“the second limb – ongoing needs and effect of orders”) including, the matters referred to in s.90sf and determine the adjustment (if any) to be made to the contribution entitlements at step two, and 4. consider the effect of the above and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred in proceedings pursuant to... s.79 [of the act] that monies howsoever received by a party during the course of the parties cohabitation are used by that party for the benefit of the family unit [and] ....thus constitute a financial contribution by the party who received the monies.

in our opinion it is not so much a matter of erosion of contribution but a question of what weight is to be attached, in all the circumstances, to the initial contribution. it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. in the present case that use was a substantial contribution to the purchase of the matrimonial home.

evidence
what were the parties’ contributions to the welfare of the family, including those in the capacity of homemaker or parent?
non-disclosure nce it has been established that there has been a deliberate non-disclosure ... then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party... [t]he court’s jurisdiction to make an order going beyond the identified property arises once there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the party has not made a full disclosure of his or her assets.
this court has pointed out in a line of cases leading up to the relevant decision of the full court in black and kellner [1992] famca 2, (1992) flc 92-287, that it is the duty of a party involved in property proceedings in this jurisdiction to make a full disclosure of their financial affairs.
the obligation [of each party to make a full and frank disclosure] arises because of the necessity for the court in such proceedings to consider all aspects of the financial circumstances of each party, if there is non-disclosure, in the relevant sense, then the failure to disclosure undermines the whole process of adjudication of the proceedings in relation to financial matters, a finding of non-disclosure may, in appropriate cases, depending upon the circumstances, result in the other party being granted, without more, the relief sought.

are the proposed orders just and equitable?
the court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.
whilst it may, as a matter of individual circumstance, be correct to say that the mere existence of disparity of wealth ought not of itself justify a settlement of property to one party at the expense of the other, it may often, in the overall circumstances of a case, call for further adjustment beyond that assessed on contributions alone, so that the final order is just and equitable...
