family violence incident on 29 august 2021
the rule in rice & asplund
the principles which, in my view, should apply in such cases are that the court should have regard to any earlier order and to the reasons for and the material on which the orders is based. it should not lightly entertain an application to reverse an earlier custody order. to do so would be to invite endless litigation for, as counsel for the appellant submitted, change is an ever-present factor in human affairs. therefore the court would need to be satisfied by the applicant that there is some changed circumstance which will justify such a serious step. some new factor arising, or at any rate, some factor which was not disclosed at the previous hearing which would have been material. these are not necessarily matters for a preliminary submission but they are matters that the judge should consider in his reasons for decision. it is a question of finding that there are circumstances which require a court to consider afresh how the welfare of the children should best be served. these principles apply whether the original order was made by consent or after a contested hearing. the way they apply and the factors which will justify the court in reviewing a custody order will vary from case to case.[3]
warnick j made the point that the implication should be avoided that if the rule is applied as a preliminary matter the parenting application is not dealt with on the merits. in particular, he noted that the “paramountcy principle” still applies to the decision to dismiss an application to vary. we agree with the conclusion reached by warnick j reached (at [81]) that: ...when the threshold question described in rice & asplund is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination ‘on the merits’. where an application is dismissed at a preliminary stage it is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of a party to appear or some lack of compliance with form and procedure. but, rather, because assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an insufficient change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing. though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child’s welfare than to allow the application to continue.[6]
in miller & harrington [2008] famcafc 150, (2008) flc 93-383,the court posed the question, 105. adapting the language used by warnick j in sps & pls [supra], the question for consideration is: assuming the evidence of the [applicant] is accepted, is there a sufficient change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing?[7] that question might be better formulated in another way in the following proposition, namely, that there is a requirement, (1), for a prima facie case of changed circumstances to have been established and, (2), for a consideration as to whether that case is a sufficient change of circumstances to justify embarking on the hearing.[8]
evaluation  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b), the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.[11]
