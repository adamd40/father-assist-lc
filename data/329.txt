reasons for judgment
1 mr harmon (the father) and ms harmon (the mother) are the parents of x, who was born in 2019, and y, who was born in 2021.
background
2 mr harmon and ms harmon are both educators.
3 mr harmon was born in 1988.
4 ms harmon was born in 1990.
5 they first started to live together in sydney, and later moved to brisbane in 2013 where they remained living until 13 march 2021.
6 they married in 2015 and separated on 20 october 2020.
7 x’s birth was a traumatic experience.
8 at separation, x was aged 14 months, y was in utero the mother being about 12 weeks into the pregnancy.
9 the father and mother initially negotiated arrangements for x to spend time with his father. the mother was often present during those periods.
10 after separation x remained living with his mother.
11 in 2021 the mother with x flew to sydney to visit with the maternal grandmother. the mother had a flight booked to return to brisbane in 2021.
12 in 2021 the mother was admitted to region d hospital with pregnancy complications, she was about 32 weeks into her pregnancy.
13 in 2021, dr e, an o&g staff specialist at region d hospital, wrote a letter stating:
ms harmon is currently pregnant with estimated due date in 2021. as she has a high risk pregnancy we recommend that she does not travel during her pregnancy.
14 the mother thereafter remained in sydney.
15 border closures initiated by the queensland government then prevented her easy return to queensland after y’s birth.
16 to do so she would have required a travel exemption, and if granted, she would then have had to quarantine in a “medi‑hotel” for 14 days with 2 young children.
17 the queensland government in early january 2022 re‑opened the border with nsw and it has remained open. travel between the two states has returned to pre‑pandemic conditions, ie. no entry permits nor quarantine are required.
18 the father did travel to sydney so as to spend time with x on 9, 10 and 11 april 2021, during a period when the border was open. he sought to spend time with x on each day he was in sydney. the mother permitted the father to spend limited time with x, only for 1 hour on 11 april 2021, despite his attempts to spend time with x on 9 and 10 april.
19 the father returned to sydney around the time of y’s birth but could not locate the hospital as the mother used an assumed name on being admitted.
20 the father filed an initiating application on 7 june 2021.
21 on 7 october 2021 a senior judicial registrar upon an interim hearing ordered:

child impact report
125 this report was prepared pursuant to an order by a senior judicial registrar, is dated 28 january 2022 and was authored by child court expert, ms z.
126 she interviewed the parents’ electronically on 24 january 2022.
127 no observations of the children with the parents occurred.
128 the consultant says the mother told her she wants the children to spend time with the father in sydney during school term time and in brisbane during school holidays.
129 the consultant says the father told her he wants the children to return to live in brisbane so he can be an actively involved parent in all domains of their life.
130 both parents agreed that the children’s primary relationship was with their mother (paragraph 7).
131 the parents spoke positively to the consultant about the children’s visits with the father, that x had maintained his bond with his father and was excited by facetime with his father (paragraph 9).
132 the mother, in discussions with the court expert, complimented the father about his understanding and management of y when he cried during visits with his father. as visits progressed y was reported to become more settled with his father (paragraph 10).
133 the mother told the court expert that y went easily with his father at the changeovers during the second block of visits, acknowledging that the father was able to comfort y. both parents told the court expert y was starting to establish a good relationship with the father (paragraph 10).
134 in the expert’s preliminary opinion the mother’s reported experience of family violence is best understood within the context of the separation and parenting dispute (paragraph 19).
135 the mother told the court expert returning to live in brisbane may compromise her parenting capacity (paragraph 23).
136 the court expert held the opinion, that given the children’s young ages and their stage of development, they would require frequent and regular time with the father to develop meaningful relationships with him (paragraph 25).
137 the court expert in paragraph 26 wrote:
the other consideration is whether the mother’s parenting capacity will be compromised to the extent that the children’s developmental outcomes and quality of their relationships will be significantly impaired if she returns to live in brisbane with them, and if orders are made for them to spend significant or equal time with their father.
138 in paragraph 31 the expert wrote:
if the parents are unable to reach a final parenting agreement, it may be appropriate for the children to continue to live in sydney on an interim basis, at least until y can be connected with a professional network to treat and manage his health and developmental needs.
139 in paragraph 32 the expert wrote:
whilst the children live in sydney, they have four facetime calls with the father each week. arrangements are made for the children to spend time with the father for as often as possible during the school term in sydney and for them to spend block periods of time with the father in brisbane during school holidays.
determination
140 it is not the subject of any controversy that x and y’s primary, most important and attached relationship is with their mother.
141 it is not the subject of controversy that x now has a comfortable and important relationship with his father.
142 it is agreed the father’s relationship with y is developing. y will now separate from his mother and engage with his father. the father is able to soothe and comfort y if he becomes upset.
143 the mother had an intention to return to brisbane after a brief visit with her mother. she seems not to have been upset by the medical decision she should not travel back.
144 the father at times has likely overconsumed alcohol in something akin to a “binge”. he is not, however, now a problematic drinker nor is he now dependent upon alcohol. he may have, when x was younger, used alcohol as a coping mechanism. an injunction on the father restraining his use of alcohol prior to and when caring for the children will mitigate any risk to the children. there is no evidence that the father has ever been non‑compliant with a court order.
145 i am not persuaded on the current evidence that the mother’s mental health would become so compromised to impact her parenting capacity if she and the children were required to live in brisbane. it would be an unwelcome turn of events for her but not more debilitating.
146 the mother has when she lived in brisbane been employed, created friendships and received support from her mother, her sister and others.
147 both parents struggled in their new role as parents following x’s birth. y is still being breastfed, but likely not exclusively breastfed, since the mother’s return to work as an educator this year.
148 the mother has acted overly protective in the past in the restrictions she has placed on the father’s time with the children, tantamount to acting as a “gatekeeper”.
149 she says she now wants to facilitate time between the children and the father. untested by cross examination i accept her assertion in this regard.
150 considerable cost will be incurred if one parent lives in brisbane and one lives in sydney to facilitate time between the children and the father. the senior judicial registrar has already allocated over $7,000 to fund the interim time with orders.
151 y is well connected with medical support in sydney. if he lived in brisbane similar support would need to be sourced.
152 x and y are of mixed racial and religious heritage.
153 to continue to develop and then grow a relationship with their father, regular frequent in person visits maximise the opportunity for that development and growth. such periods are not possible unless both parents live in the same city. i accept at this time the father cannot relocate to sydney.
154 if the parents live in the same city the implementation of a more meaningful relationship between the children and the father is cheaper and easier to implement.
155 the father’s case is he cannot and therefore will not relocate his place of residence to sydney.
156 the mother’s case is she would find it difficult to relocate her and the children’s place of residence back to brisbane, it would be costly and she does not want to.
157 the father’s proposal to overcome the practical difficulties for the mother is by providing her with a six month lease in a 2 bedroom apartment in brisbane, at a rental she could afford. i have limited evidence to know if she could afford that rent if not working. she possibly could, given before starting her new job in sydney, she was contributing to housing and living costs and rental for the unit/apartment she shares with the maternal grandmother.
158 the parents have some history in having been able to agree some past parenting arrangements.
159 on some occasions, as stated earlier, the mother has made “gatekeeper” type decisions of her own volition.
160 the mother has taken the lead in decision making regarding y post birth with little reference to the father.
161 as both parents seek and propose a relationship for both parents with each child, an order pending further order, for equal shared parental responsibility is in each child’s best interest, especially y so both can be involved in and seek information from y’s treaters.
162 equal time has not been either child’s experience to date. each child’s relationship is predominantly with their mother. the children have spent time with the father pursuant to orders made on 3 november 2021 as amended on 9 november 2021. there is no evidence anything untoward for the children has resulted.
163 for reason of the above, and they each being in the early stage of their development, a predominant period of time with one parent and a shorter in duration period with the other parent is consistent with the best interest of each of x and y. an equal time arrangement is, sensibly in light of the above, not proposed by either parent and for the above reasons is not in either child’s best interest.
164 neither x nor y is yet of a stage of development, nor strength of relationship, that makes a significant and substantial time with order in their respective best interest.
165 frequent shorter duration periods with their father are both developmentally and relationally in each child’s best interest. such frequency is not reasonably practicable if the parents live as geographically and travel time wise apart, as is the case between brisbane and sydney. it is unaffordable for this to occur when each party lives in separate cities.
166 a day time period on one weekend day a week and a mid‑week afternoon period between each child and the father is for developmental and relational reasons in each child’s best interest.
167 adults in australia usually enjoy a right of freedom of movement and place of residence. nevertheless the court has a power under s 114(3) to prohibit a parent’s relocation and to require them to relocate to a place note of their choosing. see sampson & hartnett (no 10) (2007) flc 93‑350.
168 the frequency of time with periods that have been determined to be in each of x and y’s best interest cannot with reasonable practicability occur if the father lives in brisbane and the mother lives in sydney. that can only be achieved if both parents live in the same city.
169 when the mother first visited sydney with x it was for a 6 day period. she had intended to give birth it seems in brisbane. pregnancy complications overtook that and then covid intervened.
170 the mother and x have now been in sydney for 12 months to the detriment of x’s relationship with his father, and for y to have had inhibited as quick a development of relationship with his father as would have been in his best interest.
171 the court is required by the act as set out in paragraph 77 of sampson, supra to consider the practicalities of life.
172 for the father to live in sydney, he has no housing, no job but possibly some prospects for future employment given the mother has found employment as an educator. his partner may resist a move or may come.
173 he has housing in brisbane promised by his mother and existing employment.
174 the mother for her part in sydney shared rented accommodation with her mother, now has employment and support of extended family and settled medical treatment for y.
175 in brisbane it is not clear if her job at her previous employer remains available and can be guaranteed. i will assume it is forfeited. she has no family support, apart from the father and her mother-in-law about which support she is very uncomfortable. housing will be made available should she wish as will a lump sum of $15,000 from house sale settlement which will be later characterised. both cause me to conclude it would be reasonably practicable for her to live in brisbane pending further order.
176 i am not satisfied living in brisbane will compromise her mental health to the extent she states. clearly it will be an outcome she is unhappy about.
177 on balance, pending further order, orders that require the children to live with their mother in brisbane enables as meaningful as possible a relationship between x and y with their father as is consistent currently with their best interest. the same cannot be achieved if the father visits sydney.
178 the move should occur before the end of the nsw term 1 school holidays to enable the mother to source her own accommodation if she does not wish to take up the father’s offer of rental accommodation. such a timeframe also enables the mother to seek out in brisbane treatment arrangements for y referred to in paragraph 31 of the child impact report.
179 for these reasons the children will, pending further order, live with their mother and by 26 april 2022 she is to make her and their place of residence in brisbane, and they are then to spend time with their father each sunday from 8am to 4pm and each wednesday from 4pm to 6.30pm. such periods are consistent with each child’s stage of development and enable further development of a meaningful relationship with their father.
180 such orders are reasonably practicable because of the father’s housing proposal and lump sum money distribution proposal. the mother can obtain her own housing if she wishes either immediately or later.
181 it removes the need for air travel for the father and accommodation costs in sydney.
182 pending further order, these orders are for the above reasons in each of x and y’s best interest and are also orders that are reasonably practicable.
183 further litigation is seemingly inevitable.
