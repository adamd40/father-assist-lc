reasons for judgment
judge taglieri
1 this judgment concerns parenting proceedings between mr patterson (“the father”) and ms dillard (“the mother”). they relate to two children, x born in 2017 (“the elder child”) and y born in 2019 (“the younger child”) (collectively “the children”).
2 the parties and the children all resided in queensland until the mother moved with the children to tasmania in mid-2020. the circumstances in which the mother came to live in tasmania were the subject of factual dispute and will be addressed further in these reasons.
3 the father filed an initiating application on 9 october 2020, seeking final parenting orders and urgent interim orders for the return of the children to queensland. the children did not return, and instead on 13 october 2020 interim orders were made, by consent, which provided for the father to spend time with the children in tasmania and queensland.
4 on 11 june 2021 further interim orders were made by her honour judge tonkin by consent, for the father’s time with the children. the proceedings were also transferred to the hobart registry.
5 on 2 august 2021, i made trial directions and set the proceedings down for a two day defended hearing, commencing on 17 january 2022.
the defended hearing and issues in dispute
6 both parties were represented by counsel at the hearing and each party had filed a case outline. these have been read and considered. the case outlines set out the orders sought by the parties and the contentions relied upon.
7 the case outlines revealed that the primary issues in dispute were:  whether the mother should have sole parental responsibility or if should be joint, (b) whether the mother should be required to return the children to queensland, and (c) what time the father should spend with the children and where.   whether the mother should be required to return the children to queensland, and (c) what time the father should spend with the children and where.   what time the father should spend with the children and where.
8 although the mother had initially asserted that the father posed an unacceptable risk to the children’s welfare, this was abandoned. however, the mother maintained that she ought to have sole parental responsibility due to family violence on the father’s part. she no longer pursued orders for the children’s time with the father to be supervised.
the father’s case
9 the father relied on three affidavits which were read into evidence and their deponents cross-examined, being:  the affidavit of the father filed 4 january 2022, (b) the affidavit of the paternal grandmother ms d (“the paternal grandmother”) filed 4 january 2022, and (c) the affidavit of the paternal aunt ms e (“the paternal aunt”) filed 4 january 2022.   the affidavit of the paternal grandmother ms d (“the paternal grandmother”) filed 4 january 2022, and (c) the affidavit of the paternal aunt ms e (“the paternal aunt”) filed 4 january 2022.   the affidavit of the paternal aunt ms e (“the paternal aunt”) filed 4 january 2022.

14 the parties each appeared to rely on various aspects of the family report prepared by mr j (“the family reporter”) dated 21 april 2021 (“the family report”). for convenience, his evidence was led by counsel for the father.
evidence in the father’s case
the father
15 the following evidence was elicited orally from the father in cross-examination, some confirming and some expanding on the contents of his trial affidavit.
16 he stated that he is 28 years of age and employed as an allied health worker in queensland. he lives with his brother mr k and the paternal grandmother in a home owned by mr k. the home is a large four-bedroom home with two bathrooms and a double garage. if the children are to reside with the father and when they spend time with him, there is a bedroom in the home for the children.
17 the father said that he has a good and close relationship with his mother, but his relationship with his father is currently strained. he added that he would like to mend that relationship. he stated that he had concerns about the children spending time with the maternal grandfather mr l (“the maternal grandfather”). this concern was based on reports made to him by the mother about her relationship with the maternal grandfather, involving witnessing abuse and family violence between her parents growing up.
18 the father agreed that property matters between the parties had been settled. he was referred to an application for consent orders,[1] and agreed that his gross income, consistent with that document, was $1,615 per week and that his earnings per year were about $78,000 gross. he clarified that the employment referenced in the application had come to an end shortly before christmas in 2021, so he would be starting new employment. his new place of employment is about half an hour’s drive away from his home.
19 asked if that change in employment would affect the child support assessment, the father indicated that his wage had reduced a little, but he is not sure what the new child support assessment might be. he agreed that he did not own any real estate, did not have children from another relationship, nor was he involved in any business activity in queensland.
20 it was put to the father that he was “footloose and fancy free”, so had he considered finding employment in tasmania in order to be closer to the children. the father agreed with the first proposition stating that was “in terms of commitments”. he added that he had looked at various job advertisements on seek.com and other employment websites, but he had not applied for any positions in tasmania.
21 the father conceded that if he lived in hobart it would be extremely easy to see the children and spend time with them. he also conceded that he had no commitments in queensland and that he recognised the benefits for the mother remaining in tasmania, namely that she had rent-free accommodation, that she did not have to pay any outgoings associated with owning property and that she had the maternal great-grandmother to assist her with caring for the children while she was at work.
22 he acknowledged that the elder child attends m school, an arrangement that had recently been agreed between the parties. when asked whether the father had been in contact with the elder child’s school and if he was familiar with her teacher, he replied that he had not and was not.
23 the father was also asked about whether he had established a relationship with the younger child’s day-care provider, and he had not.
24 regarding the younger child, noting that he is now two years and six months old, the father said that in his view the younger child should be weaned from breastfeeding, but added that it was not his decision to make. when asked if he had shared this opinion with the mother, he replied that he had not had a conversation with the mother about weaning the younger child.
25 the father was told by counsel for the mother that if the children were ordered to return to queensland, the mother’s position is that she would also return to queensland. the father replied that this was not a surprise. he agreed that this would require her to secure rental accommodation and pay expenses associated with that in circumstances where she was financially strained. he added that he was also financially strained.
26 in relation to finances, he said that he had a hecs debt of about $30,000. he stated that his legal fees had been paid by his parents and he considers that he should repay that money to them. when asked about the mother also having a hecs debt and owing money to her family for legal fees, the father seemed to concede that this was the case. he also conceded that there was value in the mother having rent-free accommodation and that he had not offered to pay the mother’s rent nor pay a rental bond, should she relocate back to queensland.
27 the father said that although he does not yet pay rent to his brother, there had been talk about him paying $150 a week. when asked about the matters referred to in the mother's affidavit from [88] onwards, the father replied that he had read it and that there was a lot of information, not all of which he could recall.
28 when specifically taken to some parts of the mother’s affidavit, the father agreed with counsel for the mother that the elder child’s speech had improved, but he added that he was concerned that she still struggles with words. he said that he would feel more confident if she saw a professional to assess and assist her. he agreed that he had not raised his concerns with the mother about the elder child’s speech since 2020, notwithstanding that he still held some concerns.
29 the father was asked about the my family wizard parenting app which the parties were to use pursuant to orders that were made by consent in june 2021. he agreed that he does not use the app and instead receives updates from the mother by email, information on messenger and from a free parenting app my family album. the explanation given for not using the app referred to in the court’s orders was that it involved a fee to sign up and he had not paid it due to his financial circumstances. he agreed that the mother put photographs in my family album and that he would view them there.
30 the father was asked whether he had communicated to the mother that he would not be using the my family wizard app because of its cost. he replied he had not, and he conceded that the mother had not known why he was not using it.
31 arising from the evidence discussed at [28] to [30], counsel for the mother put to the father that the mother felt that she could not productively communicate with him and asked him to comment. the father stated “i definitely could have raised concerns more frequently with [the mother]”.
32 returning to the father’s concerns about the elder child’s speech, the father also conceded that he had not spoken to the elder child’s teacher, but he could have done so. it was put to the father that if he were more pro-active that would be good for the elder child and the father agreed.
33 the father was referred to the mother’s affidavit at [128] and he stated that in hindsight he agreed that using a communication app would be better and that the communication book was a good idea.
34 the father agreed that he had known the mother had a history of anxiety and when asked about the mother’s parenting capacity, he replied “[the mother] is a fantastic mum".
35 asked about communication between the maternal family and his family at change over, and in particular [18] of the maternal grandmother’s affidavit, the father stated that he tends to close up if challenged and then withdraws. he also agreed that this style was a frustration to the mother and that it was unproductive when dealing with small children.
36 it was suggested to the father that avoidance was his reaction to uncomfortable situations and he agreed. however, when specifically asked about the maternal grandmother’s affidavit at [32] and [33] concerning a change-over in july 2021, he did not agree that he had turned away deliberately from the mother when she had attempted to pass an unfinished snack to him. by way of explanation, he said that he does not have deep and meaningful conversations with the mother at change over, but instead focuses on the children.
37 although the father did not agree with what occurred, he accepted that the children would be confused if the respective families were seen not to be communicating politely and amicably at change-over. the father stated that he still struggled to speak to the mother and that he had to constantly remind himself to be courteous and aware of her feelings, adding this needed to be from both parties’ sides and that he was not actively ignoring the mother.
38 he agreed that he was nervous with the mother and the accusation that the mother has made about him makes him concerned about being in her presence. the father added that he was consulting dr n and working with him about this.
39 the father was referred to the maternal grandmother’s affidavit at [35] concerning her observations about interactions between the families at change-overs in december 2021 and early january 2022. he agreed that at times he turned away from the mother when she spoke to him, but stated that the conversation between the paternal family and the mother had been amicable. the father did not agree that they were cold and disdainful.
40 regarding the mother's concerns during the relationship about the elder child's behaviour, said to be sexualised, the father agreed that the mother had spoken to him about it. he said that afterwards, he had been consistent with the management of the behaviours in accordance with advice the mother had been given by the child health nurse.
41 the father agreed that he was distressed by false accusations that he may have sexually abused the elder child, but when it was put to him that the mother had approached the issue in a child-focused way and with an open mind, the father agreed. he stated “i'm trying to put myself in her shoes”.
42 when referred to subpoenaed materials from f hospital reporting the difficulties the mother was having as a first-time parent, the father said that she had been doing really well given the lack of sleep. he agreed that the mother had complained about his lack of willingness to help. it was put to the father that the mother had borne the sole or most of the burden and had struggled, the father replied, “looking back, yes, i could have done more”.
43 when asked about a progress note in the joint tender bundle,[2] the father said at the time he felt he was helping, preparing meals and doing laundry. he agreed that he did not enjoy doing those tasks, but that he did not refuse to do them. he added that he tried to do as much as he could, but that the mother did not agree.
44 the father was asked about the affidavit of the maternal grandmother, to the effect that when she attended to babysit on occasions the father would come home from work and sit playing on the xbox rather than care for the children.[3] he responded that the maternal grandmother loved being involved in caring for the children and she did whatever she could to help out.
45 he agreed that he definitely allowed the mother to have the run of caring for the children, but he denied that he had stepped back. specifically asked about evidence that he had told the maternal family members that they could not hold the elder child when she was a newborn, he agreed that he had done so. he maintained that the limit was in line with the parties’ collective wishes. he said that at the time of the elder child’s birth, they had discussed how long they would want people to be at the house, but that it was he who enforced the limits. he denied that it was he alone who stopped the maternal family interacting with the elder child and the suggestion that it was controlling behaviour.
46 the father was asked about speech therapy the elder child undertook in march 2020 and referenced at index 5 of the joint tender bundle. referring to worksheets that were to be used, it was put to him that he did not do any of the worksheets with the elder child. the father replied that he could not recall the worksheets, but he thought he had been supportive of the speech therapy. when asked to give an example, he said that he had encouraged new textures in food. specifically asked about language strategy, the father could not recall. he conceded that the mother would be best placed to assess if the elder child was progressing satisfactorily with her speech or if there were real difficulties.
47 about the allegation that if the children were distressed, he would hold them away from the mother and not let her comfort them, the father said that he had read that in the mother’s affidavit, but denied that he acted in that way. concerning a specific incident with the younger child in january 2020, the father stated that he had been comforting the child after he had accidentally hurt his leg while getting him out of a highchair. he denied that he was attempting to control the mother by holding the child away and stated that the mother had taken the younger child from him. he had then gone to work and did not return until late as he had gone to the gym after work. the father’s response was that he was disappointed and angry with himself and so had stayed away. he conceded that it was in his nature to withdraw.
48 about an allegation of family violence early in the relationship to which the mother refers in her police affidavit for the purposes of the family violence application,[4] the father stated that he did not know that it had stressed her at the time. he added that it was only later when she raised it with him that he had appreciated that she felt threatened. he did not agree that he had threatened to hit the mother. he said the statement was a playful one involving connotation of intimacy.
49 the father admitted that he had used the expression “chubby” to refer to the mother on occasion, but did not recall having spoken to the mother in a derogatory way when he said “you look nice”. it was put to the father that although he thought he was being playful and saying playful things, at the time the mother was fearful. he replied he was not aware of those communication difficulties. he explained that it was not in his nature to be hurtful and when the mother had been pregnant he had found her beautiful.
50 it was put to the father that there were times when he would ignore the mother and he agreed, but disagreed that he had ignored her for a whole week following a dispute about a birthday party for the elder child. despite this, he conceded that a person like the mother would find his withdrawal hurtful and that was his way of managing disagreement.
51 the father denied that he had locked the mother out of the house deliberately, saying on occasion it had been accidental and not to control or manipulate her. he also denied being manipulative around having sex when the mother had wanted a second child and he was not ready. about the allegation that the father had been controlling with the mother’s connections and male friends, he denied this and said he was not jealous.
52 asked about the paternal aunt’s affidavit and whether he agreed with her evidence that his relationship with the children was getting more and more cemented over time since separation, the father agreed. however, he qualified this by saying that each time he saw the children there was progress, but then there would be a step back. given that he knew this, he was asked directly why he did not move to tasmania. the father replied that there were a lot of factors.
53 the father was also asked why he had not come to tasmania when the family reporter suggested that the children should stay until the mother completed her study. the father replied that he was asking for the children to be closer to her family, his parents and other family members in queensland.
54 as to the factors that influenced him not to come to tasmania, he stated: financial, emotional, career progression, and accommodation as renting was very expensive. the father agreed that they were the very same factors that impacted on the mother’s decision to remain in tasmania.
55 regarding the implications of the mother returning to queensland, the father appeared to accept that the maternal grandmother could not have the mother and children live with her. he also stated that it was approximately two hours give or take 15 minutes between where he was living and where the maternal grandmother resides. he agreed that the mother would need to obtain a car if she returns to queensland as she would want to live in city c where her mother is.
56 asked if that meant a four hour plus journey between the parents to facilitate the children spending time with him, he agreed. he also stated that there would need to be a transitional phase and he would need to think about what his proposal would be in that case.
57 the father conceded that the parties had structured their lives such that the mother would be the primary carer, that he does not communicate well and that his proposal for the children was different to that recommended in the family report. given the last concession, counsel asked if his proposal was based on his view that the younger child should be weaned. the father denied this, but agreed that his views about weaning the younger child were influenced by social stigma. he said he had not taken professional advice about the issue.
58 the father stated that he had completed the circle of security course and was seeking regular support from a psychologist to assist in improving communication and other aspects of his separation from the children.
59 during re-examination, the father was asked to clarify his proposal for the children should the mother and children live in queensland in the suburb o area. he stated that he sought a fortnightly four day/night arrangement from fridays to mondays to be adjusted after discussion between the parties once the children started school.
60 the father also clarified his earlier evidence stating: he had been considering moving to tasmania, but had been offered his current job within two weeks of the new year, soon after his previous job ended, that when the elder child was born, there were general community concerns about whooping cough, and he and the mother were concerned about reducing the risk of that being contracted by the elder child, and so limited her exposure to other persons, and in addition, the mother’s labour had been very draining and it had taken a lot out of her, so they collectively had wanted to avoid too many people in the house to solidify her recovery.
the paternal grandmother
61 the paternal grandmother gave evidence under cross-examination. she said that she works day shifts at employer p, four days a week. she agreed that she had been coming to tasmania more often than previously as she travelled with the father when he came to spend time with the children.
62 the paternal grandmother agreed that over time since the children moved to tasmania, the father’s relationship with the children had changed from distant to close and loving. she also agreed that the parents were both putting their own differences aside and not stopping each other from having a loving relationship with the children.
63 the balance of the paternal grandmother’s evidence under cross examination was to the effect that she would be available to assist the father in caring for the children and would provide support in whatever way he required. she confirmed that she would be living in the same home as the father and the children if they returned to queensland and spent more time with him.
the paternal aunt
64 the paternal aunt agreed in cross-examination that the relationship between the father and the children had grown, and they had become closer since their initial move to tasmania. questioned about the father’s engagement in caring for the children when the parties were together, the paternal aunt stated that from what she saw the father was actively involved and the mother would step in and take over.
65 the paternal aunt stated that the father had become a confident dad and that the children went to him calling him daddy and seeking comfort. it was put to the paternal aunt that the communication at handovers between the maternal and paternal families was not easy. she replied that she was polite and friendly with whomever had spoken to her, and that she would smile and respond to the mother.
evidence in the mother’s case
the mother
66 the mother stated that she is 27 years of age and is completing a master’s degree through q university. she also works part-time at employer r as an allied health worker.
67 the mother confirmed the contents of her affidavit to be true and correct and, without objection, gave some additional evidence. she stated that her brother had arrived in tasmania and was staying in a campervan at the same property occupied by the maternal great-grandmother. she said that that he now wished to live in tasmania permanently, although that had not been her intention initially after coming to tasmania.
68 in cross-examination she was asked about the sequence of events from when she had left the parties’ home to spend time with her mother and later communicated that she intended to go to tasmania for a placement as part of her studies.
69 it was directly put to the mother that the father had not known that she intended to stay long-term and that his agreement was only for the children to temporarily move to tasmania, allowing the mother to complete her placement. the mother’s evidence was that the original plan had not been to remain in tasmania permanently. she also agreed that there had also been a discussion about possibly relocating to sydney as her father intended to live there
70 it was put to the mother that, based on discussions between her and the father after april 2020, he had correctly thought that there was a prospect of reunification. the mother’s reply was that she had told the father unequivocally on 9 june 2020 before moving to tasmania, that she was separating from him. she was referred to a text message she had sent on 22 july 2020.[5] it was put to her that the contents of the message were inconsistent with her having told the father previously that the relationship was definitely over. the mother disagreed, however she admitted that by august 2020, she had indicated to the father that she would remain in tasmania until she completed her master’s degree.
71 if the children were ordered to return to queensland, the mother said she would also do so, but would prefer that the move not be until she completed her master’s degree. further, that due to an administrative error regarding various units for her degree she would now not complete her master’s degree until december 2023, whereas if the error had not been made, she would have completed the study in 2022. this evidence was not challenged.
72 about the nature of her study, the mother said that the master’s degree was through q university and was entirely external. she agreed that there was no reason for her to be specifically in tasmania to complete her study. she also agreed that the study could be done anywhere there is internet connection and that the arrangement she made to do it while in tasmania was based on lifestyle considerations. although the mother had already arranged to undertake practical units for her study at employer r in tasmania, she appeared to agree that she could do the units in queensland.
73 counsel for the father put to the mother that for the sake of the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with the father and continuing to develop it, it would be better if she were not living 2,500 km away. the mother replied “potentially, yes”.
74 the mother confirmed that she no longer sought for the father’s time with the children to be supervised. she also admitted that the first time she had made that concession was on 1 january 2022. it was put to the mother that she now accepted that the father was not an unacceptable risk to the children. she replied that she had seen an improvement in their relationship, and that the children counted down to when they could see their father and missed him. it was again put to the mother that she accepted that the father was not an unacceptable risk, and she then agreed.
75 asked about her proposal for the father to spend time with the children in tasmania, the mother conceded that her proposal now was less than that to which she had consented in interim orders. the mother agreed, explaining that the elder child now has school on fridays.
76 the mother was asked why she sought a gradual increase to overnight time for the children and father, when she had consented to two overnights in a previous interim order. she said that it related to the younger child breastfeeding at night and that he had not been weaned. it was suggested that the younger child could take a bottle if she expressed breastmilk, but she disagreed saying that he would not take a bottle nor a sipping cup. the mother was pressed about whether the younger child had spent any overnight times without her and she maintained that he had not.
77 the mother said she did not consider that the elder child is ready for overnight time with the father as there needed to be a normalisation for her being comfortable with days and adjusting to overnight.
78 regarding family in queensland, the mother gave evidence that her sister ms s lives in queensland and the maternal grandmother also lives in city c. she agreed that her brother, mr t, usually lived in queensland until he went travelling in his van. asked about how often she would see mr t on her trips back to queensland, she stated that she had not seen him for a year, nor had the children.
79 it was put to the mother that there were a number of important family members for her and the children in queensland. she reluctantly conceded this, but added there were also important ones in tasmania, meaning her paternal grandparents. the mother also said that her father had been renting a home in sydney, but had made an offer to purchase a property in suburb u in tasmania. asked whether her father might have resources to assist her return to queensland, she replied “he may do, i’m not certain”.
80 after it was clarified that the elder child would commence full-time school in january 2024, the mother was asked why she did not propose that the children travel to queensland in the school holidays before that. she replied that she did not want to commit to further time in queensland before 2024, when she may not be in a financial position to make good on the promise.
81 the mother agreed with counsel for the father that her proposal did not allow the father to have incidental contact with the children at school and she agreed. further, it was suggested that her proposal deprived the father from involvement in the children’s extracurricular activities, such as dance lessons. the mother agreed, but commented that he could participate if those events were on weekends when he travelled to tasmania. the mother also conceded in cross-examination that her proposal:  did not always provide for special occasions such as birthdays to be spent with the father, (b) meant that if the children needed to go to hospital, the father would not be able to be there to comfort them and that it would be better on such occasions if they could both be present.   meant that if the children needed to go to hospital, the father would not be able to be there to comfort them and that it would be better on such occasions if they could both be present.
82 when asked about the negative and destabilising impact of travel required to facilitate the father’s time, the mother indicated that she believed the arrangements were working.
83 various propositions were put to the mother about the number of nights the father would spend with the children pursuant to her proposal. ultimately, it was put that the proposal totalled 82 to 102 nights a year. the mother said she agreed, however she had counted the days rather than nights. the mother agreed that this was less than what the family reporter had recommended.
84 it was suggested to the mother that the difficulty of the distance between the father and the children and missed activities implicit in her proposal meant that the father would not have an equivalent role in the children’s lives. the mother said she did not necessarily agree, adding that she knew of parents who parented very well in that way.
85 the mother initially confirmed her statement at [97] of her affidavit filed 4 january 2022. when challenged, she then clarified that she meant that there was “no effective and productive communication” between her and the father.
86 the mother said that she could imagine how confronting it would have been for the father to receive correspondence from her lawyers about the allegations of sexual abuse. the mother also conceded that prior to moving to tasmania, even after she had moved out of the family home, there had been reasonable communication between the parties. she agreed that since coming to tasmania, all communications had been under the umbrella of the proceedings, with lawyers sending communication back-and-forth. in that context, counsel for the father put to the mother that if the communication was seen as poor, it may have been because of the litigation. the mother agreed, saying that could have impacted, but that the communication before the proceedings was not good either.
87 the mother stated that because of the terms of the consent orders, there had been little opportunity for the parents to trial co-parenting. it was put to her by counsel for the father that: the enrolment form for the elder child to attend child care had been returned signed by the father within a week, she had not invited discussion or consultation about which school the elder child would attend, but notwithstanding that the father had simply agreed and signed the form, and the father had agreed to her request for the younger child to attend v child care and that she had not sought his opinion beforehand. the mother replied that she thought that by informing the father that would give him an opportunity to comment.
88 the mother agreed with these propositions and when asked if these were examples of effective co-parenting decisions she conceded that they were.
89 regarding the elder child’s speech pathology appointments during the relationship, the mother agreed that she had taken responsibility because that was the nature of their relationship and that the father had not stopped her being in charge of this and that he trusted her to do so.
90 the mother was asked about how equal shared parental responsibility might materially differ from her proposal that she have sole parental responsibility, but that she consult with the father on decisions. the mother stated that the she would want to be the one to make the decision as she had been the primary carer, adding “i know the children better, i have spent their entire lives with them”.
91 it was put to the mother that she had not communicated with the father about the children’s health since relocating to tasmania. she stated that she thought she put something in through the communication app. it was suggested to the mother that the communication had been poor from both parties, and it was not just a one-way street. the mother replied “yes, i am aware.”
92 the mother agreed that there were no imperative decisions to be made about the children in the foreseeable future. asked if there could be joint decision-making, the mother stated “i would like to make decisions jointly, but i also don’t want to be back in a court room in six months because we can’t”.
the maternal great-grandmother
93 the maternal great-grandmother gave evidence under cross-examination. she lives in tasmania, and travelled to queensland to spend time with the children prior to the mother and children relocating.
94 her understanding of the reasons for the mother relocating to tasmania were that the relationship between the mother and the father was “not good” and that the mother did not feel safe. when questioned about her statement in her affidavit that she made arrangements for the mother and child to live with her for “as long as necessary”,[6] she said that at the time there was no discussion how long that would be.
95 counsel for the father asked at what point discussions had occurred about the mother completing practical placements for her master’s degree in tasmania. the maternal great-grandmother’s evidence was that the mother had asked her before the younger child was born if she would be able to care for the children while the mother undertook the practical work 5 days a week. she stated that she works approximately 3 days a week as a self-employed consultant, which gives her the capacity to assist as she could schedule her work around care commitments.
96 the maternal great-grandmother confirmed that the elder child’s speech has improved since moving to tasmania, and she has not observed any concerning behaviour from the children. it was put to her that the children enjoy the time they spent with the father, she agreed, and stated that they are happy to see him and she has not seen them distressed.
97 the maternal great-grandmother was recalled. she stated that she was prepared to give an undertaking to the court. her evidence about this was:[7]
ms mooney: [...], you wish to give some more evidence to this court about a certain matter? --- yes, i do. thank you. and you have indicated as part of that that you are prepared to give the court an undertaking about certain matters? --- that’s correct. and are you confident that you have had some advice about what an undertaking to this court entails? i have, yes. yes. thank you, your honour. can you please just do just that, then. thank you, [...]? --- yes ..... based on the effect that the children seem very settled and happy here and they do need to have continued extended interaction with their father because it has – it is really good and i have seen them talk about it and they chat about it especially x, so it has been positive. if it is a financial impediment to [the father] getting down here, were my granddaughter and the children to remain in tasmania, i’m prepared to offer up to eight and a half thousand dollars a year towards his travel and accommodation for a period of five years and then for a period of two years after that for it to be half of that because my expectation is that he has had financial issues. his – well, occupational issues, i think. he is – he doesn’t have any assets and after five years, hopefully, with the support of his family – which he has got – he would be in a better position to be able to fund his visits to tasmania. her honour: now, in giving me that evidence, [...], would you want to restrict or limit precisely how that sum of money is directed? so for example, would you provide a certain amount per trip or would you say it must be paid directly by you to airfares. how would you propose it worked from a practical perspective? --- i had not – i had not thought that through from a practical perspective. i could put it into a bank account and allow him to draw from it or i could – he could, “these are the airfares – these are my airfares”. i could pay. i’m very flexible on how that – that will be used. and knowing airfares go up and down and accommodation i wouldn’t think to restrict it like, “you can only have so much per visit”. i don’t actually want to get in a controlling environment. i just want to be able to make sure it’s available to be used in the manner it should be used.
98 in light of this evidence and the generosity of the offer, i enquired of the maternal great-grandmother about the maternal family’s capacity to financially assist the mother to relocate back to queensland if that is what the court ordered. the question i posed and the maternal great-grandmother’s evidence was as follows:[8]
but my question was broader than that. it was the family’s capacity to assist the mother in relocating if that’s what the court ordered. would the family be in a position to do that? --- what we have done in the past, your honour, and what we will carry on doing is assist wherever we can, whether it’s financially or any other means to make sure that ms dillard, our granddaughter, and the two children, do not have to put up with any more hardship than they actually have to go through now. i see? --- yes. all right? --- is that - - - well, it’s helpful to a degree. can i accept that there would be some thousands of dollars that the family could commit to assisting the mother relocate if i ordered that?‑‑‑i – yes, your honour. yes.
the maternal grandmother
99 the maternal grandmother gave evidence in accordance with her affidavit. she resides in queensland, some hours travel from the father’s residence and will soon commence employment as an allied health worker working from her home inn city c.
100 she confirmed in response to questions from counsel for the father that she has a close relationship with the mother and the children. however, she also gave evidence that if the mother and the children move back to queensland it is not possible for them to live with her as the spare room in her house will soon be used as her home office.
101 in reference to evidence about changeovers in her affidavit,[9] the maternal grandmother stated that the elder child is upset at changeover about ninety per cent of the times she is present. she said that this was both when transitioning to the father’s care and returning from it. she conceded that it may be due to the children also being excited to see paternal family members in queensland and added that there was tension at changeovers. when asked to elaborate on the nature of the tension, the maternal grandmother said that at the last few changeovers, the father has been disdainful towards the mother and that the paternal family have been disdainful towards the maternal family.
102 referring to articles about the property market near her residence annexed to her affidavit,[10] she agreed with counsel for the father that she has no expertise in the rental market, however she said that anecdotally she is aware of the difficulties due to the experiences of family and friends.
103 she was challenged that her estimated travel time between her residence and the father’s residence was inflated by traffic congestion at the time she accessed the route on google maps.[11] she denied this proposition and stated that if there was congestion it would take longer, this assertion was made on the basis of her own experience.
104 the maternal grandmother agreed that her relationship with the maternal grandfather ended in 2017. she stated that he had perpetrated family violence against her during their relationship.
the mother’s psychologist
105 the mother’s psychologist had conducted a total of 28 treatment sessions with the mother since november 2019.[12] he prepared a report on 9 november 2020, which was annexed to his affidavit filed 4 january 2022.[13] he deposes that it would be detrimental to the mother’s and the children’s well-being to return to queensland, but acknowledged that his opinion is limited by the fact that he has not read the family report nor consulted with the paternal family.[14]
106 it was put to the mother’s psychologist by counsel for the father that he has no specialist qualification regarding family violence or child abuse, which he accepted.
107 when asked about an incident in 2015 identified by the mother as physical family violence,[15] he said that there was an “incredibly remote possibility” that the father’s behaviour was flirtatious. he conceded that he took the mother’s account at face value, however it was clear to him that the mother was still traumatised by it five years after the event. it was put to him that the mother’s recollection may have been informed by unhappiness and feelings of threat which she experienced later in the relationship, and he accepted that might be so.
108 the mother’s psychologist was cross-examined about a number of depression anxiety and stress scale 21 (“dass-21”) tests which the mother completed. the first in november 2019 at her initial assessment and then two in the latter half of 2020. he agreed that the mother’s scores for stress on the dass-21 tests decreased over time, and he attributed it to increased feelings of safety due to her geographic distance from the father along with an exit from the dynamics of the relationship.
109 he stated the balance of risk factors and protective factors for the mother is optimised in tasmania. a second relocation would, in his opinion, destabilise the mother given that she has had a period of time to establish herself in the community and in her employment. he said that it would be difficult but not impossible for the mother to re-establish herself elsewhere.
the family reporter
110 the family reporter gave evidence about his family report of 21 april 2021, annexed to his affidavit filed 17 may 2021.
111 the family reporter had interviewed the mother, the father, the maternal great-grandmother and mother’s paternal grandfather mr w. he also had observed the children, and reported that they both appeared to have a positive relationship with both parents.[16]
112 various paragraphs of the family report make reference to the mother’s eventual return to queensland at the end of her master’s degree,[17] and the family report included alternate recommendations based on the children remaining in tasmania in the short term and then returning to queensland.
113 the recommendations contained in the family report are that: the children live with the mother,[18] the mother travel to queensland with the children for ten days during each school holiday period, with the children to spend increasing stretches of unsupervised time with the father during that ten day period,[19] and the father travel to tasmania at least twice per school term, during which times the children spend two to three days with the father.[20]
114 the alternate recommendation is that:[21]
upon [the mother] returning to qld ... the children spend time with [the father] each alternate weekend and half of the school holidays.
115 i queried the family reporter’s understanding of the mother’s position as reported to him, given the mother’s evidence that she did not tell him that she intended to return to queensland and claimed that he misconstrued what she told him. he stated that he could not elaborate further on what is contained in the family report other than to confirm that his perception was that the mother’s relocation was for the purpose of her master’s degree and she would return to queensland with the children once that was complete. he confirmed that he had no contemporaneous notes of their conversations as he habitually deletes those when he finalises a report.
116 counsel for the father put the following assumed facts from evidence to the family reporter: the father lives in south queensland and has recently moved into a home owned by his brother, with discussions of paying nominal rent, the father’s parents have recently separated and soon the paternal grandmother will be living in the house with the father and his brother, the mother and the children have continued to live in tasmania since the writing of the family report, residing near the maternal great-grandparents’ residence in a property purchased for her by the maternal grandfather, the mother’s intention is for her and the children to reside permanently in tasmania, and any comment she made to the family reporter about returning to queensland were only in the context of the court ordering her to do so, in the event that she does return to queensland, the mother’s preference is to reside near the maternal grandmother, some distance from the father, the mother’s studies are continuing, the mother no longer asserts that the children are at risk in the father’s care, and the mother concedes that the children enjoy the time they spend with the father.
117 the evidence of the family reporter was that his assessment of the benefit to the children in returning to queensland changed on the basis that:  the mother and the children are settled in tasmania, (b) the current situation with covid-19, and (c) the comparative high cost of living.   the current situation with covid-19, and (c) the comparative high cost of living.   the comparative high cost of living.
118 given that at the time of the family report it was foreseeable that the mother and children would become settled in tasmania even before the completion of the mother’s master’s degree, counsel put to the family reporter that these were not reasons to alter his view. he disagreed with this assertion.
119 he agreed that a move back to queensland at the end of 2022, as anticipated by him, would be one which he considered appropriate to further develop and protect their relationship with the father. he stood by [170] of family report, which says:
170. the longer [the father] and [the mother] live the distance apart they are now, the further the risk of impact on the children’s capacity to develop an equally meaningful relationship with the other parent, with this writer having serious concerns should [the mother] remain in tasmania for too long, as [the children]’s ability to develop a secure attachment relationship with [the father] will be severely impacted.
120 however, he emphasised that the risk would be alleviated by the children spending increased periods of time with the father, stating further that many children live geographically distant from a parent. his recommendation is that the elder child ought to spend blocks of at least seven nights with the father and the younger child three to five nights at least four times a year, given the mother’s concession that the father is not an unacceptable risk to them.
121 similarly, he disagreed with counsel for the father that the ongoing circumstances surrounding covid-19 and the cost of living were the mother to return to queensland were all foreseeable at the time he wrote the family report. the family reporter maintained that the expense of relocating, the effects of covid-19, and the impact on the mother’s parenting, all indicated it was now in children’s best interests to remain in tasmania.
122 when questioned by counsel for the mother, the family reporter agreed that: the improvement in the children’s relationship with the father is evidence not only of the father parenting appropriately, but also the mother encouraging the children’s relationship with him, and stress to the mother could potentially affect the children’s ability to form such attachments with the father.
123 the family reporter advised that there is no reason why the younger child cannot spend overnight time with father, even taking account of the fact that he is breastfed. he agreed that the elder child’s time could be longer than it currently is, and that the younger child’s time with the father could increase in the future. he noted that it is not preferable to separate siblings, but sometimes it is necessary to accommodate their individual best interests.
124 as to the level of conflict between the parents, the family reporter said that it is in the interests of the children for that to be reduced. he gave evidence that children can experience stress from birth and during infancy if they witness conflict and hear raised voices, and it can affect their attachments to their parents even to the point of aligning themselves to one or other parent. he recommended that the parents communicate via a parenting app.
125 counsel for the mother put to the family reporter that it would be in the best interests of the children for the father to relocate to live near the children in tasmania. he replied that it would be better for the children and their relationship with the father, but he is unaware of the logistics which may influence the practicality of that. he added that the same issues affecting the mother returning to queensland would affect the father relocating to tasmania. he stated “it goes both ways” and it not desirable to negatively affect the father’s capacity by requiring him to move to tasmania.
legal principles – parenting
general parenting principles
126 in parenting proceedings, the paramountcy principle applies and the court is required to make orders that are in the best interests of the child/children.[22] express direction is provided in section 60b(1) of the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”) that this object is to be achieved by ensuring that the child has the benefit of both of their parents having meaningful involvement in their life, to the maximum extent consistent with the child’s best interests. the court is to inform itself of the child’s best interests by the considerations in section 60cc(2) and (3) of the act.
127 section 60cc(2) requires the court to make orders that are conducive to a child having a meaningful relationship with both parents, but not if this would detract from necessary protection of the child from physical or psychological harm or exposure to abuse, neglect or family violence. the assessment required also involves consideration of the many considerations in section 60cc(3) as relevant to the circumstances of any given case, but there is no ranking of importance or order of consideration of the relevant considerations.[23]
128 the evaluation of risk of harm required by subparagraphs (a) and (b) of section 60cc(2) is a challenging one to be undertaken on the basis of findings of fact about the nature and degree of risk of harm to the child and the likelihood of it eventuating.[24]
129 in addition to the foregoing, the court is also to apply a rebuttable presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for the parents to have equal shared parental responsibility.[25] this presumption accords with the objective referred to in section 60b(1) of the act. the meaning of parental responsibility is expressly but not exhaustively provided for in the act.[26]
130 except in the case of consent orders, if the court is satisfied that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility applies and is not rebutted it must first consider if the child spending equal time with each parent would be in their best interests and if practicable, make such an order.[27]
131 if not persuaded to make an equal spend time with order, the court must then consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests and if so and it is reasonably practicable, an order for substantial and significant time should be made. the meaning of the phrase substantial and significant time is provided for in subsection 65daa(3).
132 in mrr & gr [2010] hca 4, the high court provided guidance in relation to how the provisions in section 65daa are to be applied and i have had regard to that authority.[28] i am also mindful of the required decision making pathway established in goode & goode [2006] famca1346. all the considerations in section 60cc are to inform what is in the best interests of a child, which is relevant to making an order for equal shared parental responsibility if the presumption in section 61da(1) does not apply by virtue of section 61da(2), or making orders about equal or significant time when the presumption has been rebutted.
relocation principles
133 in cases such as this, where one parent seeks an order that the children live with them in a location different to the other parent, it is common to refer to the matter as a ‘relocation case’. despite this, it is established that the court’s over-riding task is to make parenting orders about residency and parental responsibility that are consistent with the best interests of the children.[29] indeed, in b and b: family law reform act [1997] famca 33, 1995 (1997) flc 92-755, nicholson cj, fogarty and lindenmayer jj said that:[30]
... it is noted that relocation cases are not some separate category within the family law act, to be determined by their own principles and rules. each is a case under part vii relating to the best interests of the children but within a particular context and, as with any other relevant case relating to children within the jurisdiction of this court, is to be determined in accordance with the principles contained in that part ...
134 their honours bryant cj, faulks dcj and finn j in taylor & barker [2007] famca 1246 gave guidance as to the approach which courts are to take in such matters, saying:
62. ...given that the concept of the child’s best interests is the determinative factor in the application of so many of the provisions of part vii, and given that s 60cc(1) provides that in determining what is in the child’s best interests, the court must consider the matters set out in subsection (2) (“primary consideration”) and subsection (3) (“additional considerations”) of that section, it would seem only logical that the court make findings regarding the matters contained in those subsections (so far as they are relevant in a particular case) before attempting to apply any other provision in part vii in which the determinative factor is the subject child’s best interests.’
135 further, in star & duggan [2009] famcafc 115, their honours boland, thackray & watts jj outlined a ‘logical approach’ in addressing the relevant legislative provisions at [38], being to: first make findings concerning the relevant s 60cc factors, then consider (based on the s 60cc findings) whether equal time or substantial and significant time is in the child’s best interests, and then consider whether such arrangements are reasonably practicable by addressing the matters referred to in s 65daa(5) – which may be done by referring back to the earlier s 60cc findings.
136 this methodology was affirmed in hepburn & noble [2010] famcafc 111 as favourable over the previous approach in a & a: relocation approach [2000] famca 751, (2000) flc 93-035.
137 importantly, in determining what course is in the best interests of the children, the court cannot hear the issue of relocation discretely from other applications as to where and with whom the children ought to live. their honours said in taylor & barker:
53. we agree that when dealing with a case concerning the future living arrangements for a child, and involving a significant change in the geographical place where the child is to live, the preferred approach according to established principle has been not to deal with that change, or relocation, as a separate or discrete issue, but rather as just one of the proposals for the child’s future living arrangements, at least in so far as that approach is possible (see u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238, (2002) flc 93-112 and bolitho & cohen [2005] famca 458, (2005) flc 93-224).
evaluation of evidence and findings
best interests considerations
138 there was no dispute regarding the primary considerations in section 60cc(2) of the act. that is, the evidence showed and the parties did not dispute the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with each parent. further, although the mother had previously contended that the father posed an unacceptable risk of harm to the children by virtue of alleged behaviours during the relationship, including family violence, at trial she conceded that this was no longer the case. she admitted the concession was made only recently.
139 regarding the considerations in section 60cc(3) of the act, based on the evidence elsewhere referred to in these reasons, i make the following findings:
children’s views
140 the children are now five and two-and-a-half years of age. there is no evidence of any view they have expressed. regardless, any views they might express are likely to be of marginal weight because of their immaturity.[31] despite this, the evidence of both parties is that the children miss the father.[32]
nature of relationships with children
141 the parties did not contest in any material way the proposition that each parent has a close, meaningful and loving relationship with the children. in the mother’s case, her relationship has all the hallmarks of a dedicated primary carer since each child’s birth.[33]
142 in the father’s case, because of the agreed relationship dynamics, he was predominantly the breadwinner and employed full-time. he was less available to the children, but i am satisfied and accept his evidence that he was involved in their care. however, the extent to which he was and wanted to be involved is in issue. noting many frank concessions, which bolster credibility in my view, i find that he: mostly let the mother have the running of the children’s care, deferred to the mother and let her lead, and avoided or withdrew from participation at times.
143 in relation to avoidance or withdrawal conceded by the father,[34] it likely occurred due to a combination of factors, including: the mother disapproving or criticising the quality of what he did, the father’s tendency to withdraw and avoid working through differences, and i infer,[35] the father’s prioritisation of work and personal health/fitness over assisting the mother with the children and in the home.
144 these findings are also supported by the contents of contemporaneous progress notes from the child health checks.[36]
145 nevertheless, all the evidence before me is to the effect that since the parties’ separation, the relationship between the father and the children had strengthened. there was an abundance of unchallenged evidence from witnesses, including family members, to the same effect.
146 the evidence of the maternal grandmother and paternal grandmother and maternal great-grandmother establishes, because it was unchallenged, that each of them have a strong bond and loving, safe and caring relationship with the children.[37] the family reporter expressed a similar view also, which i accept.
147 indicative of the positive attitude of the paternal grandmother and paternal aunt was evidence that they had often travelled to tasmania with the father so as to also spend time with the children. this illustrates their commitment to a mutually positive and fulfilling relationship with the children.
148 in respect of the father, he is to be commended for travelling to tasmania pursuant to the cycle set out in the interim orders. it required him to travel from queensland to tasmania return two months out of three to experience spending a relatively limited period of time with the children over weekends in tasmania. this demonstrates the genuine and sincere commitment that the father has to wanting to promote and further develop his relationship with the children for the benefit of the children.
149 in making these findings, i am mindful that the nature of the father’s relationship with the children after the mother moved from the family home and prior to them travelling to tasmania was likely to have been somewhat different. i infer from the evidence that the children’s relationship with the father was likely adversely impacted due to the relationship issues the parents were navigating at the time and the allegations in the domestic violence protection order.[38]
150 further, the communications between the parents evidenced in their text messages demonstrated that the father was grappling with trying to understand what was being alleged against him and the criticisms of his parenting by the mother. this is hardly surprising and i do not make any adverse finding about the father either in respect of his attitude to parenthood or towards the mother at this time.
parents’ participation in decision-making for the children and attitude to obligations
151 the evidence, including concessions by the father, establishes that the mother has been primarily responsible for decision making about the children’s health and education.
152 having regard to the evidence of the father, which i accept, this was not likely a reflection that the father was disinterested or unwilling to contribute. rather it is a reflection of the agreed roles the parties had in their relationship and the family structure. also, because the mother clearly was organised and pro-active, while the father tended to defer to her.
153 the subpoenaed health records and evidence from both parties demonstrate and i find that, the mother was diligent, protective and proactive in relation to the children’s health issues, including the elder child’s speech development and other behaviours. i infer from notes and entries made by the health providers that the parents communicated about such issues. that is consistent with the father’s evidence that he was prepared to let the mother lead in the decisions to be taken, offering limited views at times and trusting the mother’s judgment.[39]
154 the mother’s case involved some implied criticism directed to the father for not being as engaged as expected by her, for example with respect to speech pathology worksheets and other exercises recommended by the elder child’s speech pathologist. in my view, the evidence does not rise to establish a disregard for the health needs of the children. instead, i find that overall the father was prepared to trust the mother’s decisions, so acquiesced as this was compatible with the mother’s desire to primarily deal with such issues[40] and his engagement in full-time work limiting his availability.
155 the mother is critical of the father for the amount of time he spent with the children during the relationship. it is evident from the entries and notes in the subpoenaed documents that she struggled at times to manage the significant demands of being the primary carer of very young children. in my view, the cause for this appears to be quite complex.
156 the mother clearly had strong and particular views about the children’s care routine. this seems consistent with her pre-existing history of anxiety. i am satisfied on the evidence that the father’s approach was not necessarily always consistent with her expectations. this discord, on the mother’s own evidence, appears to have led to disagreements which were not resolved. the father frequently conceded in cross-examination that he would avoid or shut down, and by contrast the mother said she required and sought that these issues be resolved to her satisfaction.[41]
157 i find that the father did spend time caring for the children and take some responsibility for the household’s daily routines, but the extent to which he did so was influenced by the relationship dynamic and different parenting and communication styles referred to above.
communication by the parties with the children
158 while the parties were together, the opportunity taken by the parties to communicate with the children is in the context of the very young ages of the children. there is no suggestion that the father failed to communicate with the children. since the parties have separated the materials before the court make it abundantly clear that the father has steadfastly pursued ensuring communication occurred with the children.[42]
159 for example, between april and june 2020, he would regularly commute and visit to spend time with and i infer speak and interact with the children. after the mother moved to tasmania with the children, an agreed regime was put in place by way of interim orders, where he telephoned or video called the children very regularly.
160 i reject the portrayal by the mother of this communication as an attempt to control her. it is more likely and i find that the father was influenced to be in frequent contact with the children due to:  distress and shock of learning of the domestic violence protection order, (b) the mother removing the children to tasmania, and (c) later, allegations referred to in the letter from delaney & delaney dated 2 december 2020.[43]   the mother removing the children to tasmania, and (c) later, allegations referred to in the letter from delaney & delaney dated 2 december 2020.[43]   later, allegations referred to in the letter from delaney & delaney dated 2 december 2020.[43]
161 as the children were young, communications practically needed to be via the mother.
162 the mother has fully participated in spending time and communicating with the children as she has been the primary carer.
163 neither party raised as particularly relevant section 60cc(3)(ca) of the act. however, the unchallenged position is that the father pays child support for the children.
effect on children of change in circumstances, separation from a parent and practical difficulty/expense (s 60cc(d) and (e) of the act)
164 key considerations necessarily carrying significant weight in the court’s deliberations are those referred to in sections 60cc(3)(d) and (e), due to the mother and children now living in tasmania since mid-2020 and her desire to remain here permanently.
165 there was an abundance of consistent evidence about the strengthening of the father’s relationship since separation, supportive of a possible finding that there would likely be no adverse effect on the children if they remained in tasmania while the father lived in queensland.
166 the mother conceded that by remaining in tasmania, the children would experience limits on the time spent with the father.[44] despite this, the mother did not accept that remaining in tasmania separated from the father would limit the mutual benefits of a meaningful relationship between father and children.
167 however, the offer of money to ease the financial impost of travel between tasmania and queensland, inferentially is recognition of the limitations referred to at [166] and the practical barriers to ensuring the children have all aspects of a meaningful relationship with the father.
168 the offer to the father by the maternal family reduces some costs required to be incurred if the children remain in tasmania and the father in queensland. it does not overcome the effect of the children’s physical separation from the father, extended paternal and maternal family. this includes the maternal grandmother.
169 the mother gave categorical evidence and her counsel submitted that if the children were ordered to return to queensland, she would also return. accordingly, there is no contest about potential adverse effect of separation between the mother and the children.
170 although a return to queensland will be a change in circumstances, the factual context in which the move to tasmania occurred is, in my view, relevant. also relevant is that there is little compelling evidence before the court that the mother and children would suffer particular detriment to either their health or well-being if they returned. the family reporter’s evidence was that another move would be destabilising for the children, but his emphasis was on practical and financial disadvantages for the mother if required to return to queensland based on experience.
171 the evidence of the mother’s psychologist about the adverse effect on the mother’s psychological state if the children returned to queensland was not persuasive for four reasons:  he frankly acknowledged that his assessment was one based on being the mother’s treating psychologist, making subjective assessments based on the mother’s reports only, (b) he had no particular expertise in family violence cases, (c) his views are premised upon an untested assumption that the father perpetrated family violence and was both physically and emotionally abusive to the mother, and (d) he did not address what influence or contribution the mother’s experience of family violence as a child in her own parents’ home may have impacted on her anxiety and depression. indeed, the mother’s psychologist makes no reference to the mother suffering anxiety or an eating disorder prior to her relationship with the father.   he had no particular expertise in family violence cases, (c) his views are premised upon an untested assumption that the father perpetrated family violence and was both physically and emotionally abusive to the mother, and (d) he did not address what influence or contribution the mother’s experience of family violence as a child in her own parents’ home may have impacted on her anxiety and depression. indeed, the mother’s psychologist makes no reference to the mother suffering anxiety or an eating disorder prior to her relationship with the father.   his views are premised upon an untested assumption that the father perpetrated family violence and was both physically and emotionally abusive to the mother, and (d) he did not address what influence or contribution the mother’s experience of family violence as a child in her own parents’ home may have impacted on her anxiety and depression. indeed, the mother’s psychologist makes no reference to the mother suffering anxiety or an eating disorder prior to her relationship with the father.   he did not address what influence or contribution the mother’s experience of family violence as a child in her own parents’ home may have impacted on her anxiety and depression. indeed, the mother’s psychologist makes no reference to the mother suffering anxiety or an eating disorder prior to her relationship with the father.
172 the strongest reasons for justifying remaining in tasmania are that the children are settled, healthy and content. by contrast, there is no evidence capable of satisfying me on the balance of probabilities that this can be maintained if they are required to return to queensland.
173 regarding practical disadvantages to the mother and children if they were to return to queensland, while these might be mitigated in view of the maternal grandmother’s evidence referred to at [98] of the reasons which i accept, there is no evidence permitting a finding about how precisely this would be likely achieved.
capacity of parties and other family to parent and assist
174 there was considerable evidence adduced in the mother’s case criticising the father’s capacity to provide for the physical, emotional and intellectual needs of the children while the parties were together. similar criticism is not made as to the present or future.
175 further, the evidence from the father[45] not contradicted by the mother, is that the father has undertaken education courses and psychological treatment to improve his capacity:  to be attuned to the needs of the children, both physical and emotional, and (b) to communicate and interact with the mother to effectively co-parent.   to communicate and interact with the mother to effectively co-parent.
176 in view of the matters at [174] and [175], i am satisfied that the father has the capacity to parent satisfactorily and will avail himself of opportunities to do so, subject to limitations imposed by the orders the court makes.
177 the unchallenged evidence adduced in the father’s case was that the paternal grandmother and paternal aunt were close to the children and that they would assist in caring for them when able, should the children reside in queensland. apart from a past reference about the elder child not wanting others to change her nappy when she was a baby, there is absolutely no criticism made of their capacity to parent, or provide for the children’s physical and emotional needs. i find accordingly that the paternal grandmother and paternal aunt have satisfactory capacity to parent when called upon, but their involvement will be dependent on determination of the court about whether the children remain in tasmania. noting that the paternal grandmother works every second weekend and has two days off during the week in lieu, she effectively works four days per week. i infer from the evidence that she has capacity to assist in changeovers and providing care not greatly dissimilar to the maternal great-grandmother referred to below, if the children return to queensland.
178 similarly, unchallenged evidence was given that the maternal great-grandmother assisted in caring for the children. i accept that she has capacity to do so and provides physically and emotionally relative to her role as great-grandmother to the children. she assists the mother three times per week and as requested. the maternal great-grandmother has a degree of flexibility as an additional carer to support the mother, as her hours are flexible and she is able to work from home.
179 the parties did not adduce evidence relevant to sub-paragraphs (g) and (h) of section 60cc(3) of the act and no relevance was placed on them at trial.
attitude to children and responsibilities of parenthood
180 it is apparent that the mother has a negative opinion of the father’s attitude to the responsibilities of parenthood during the relationship. indeed, this is evident from the sequence of events which led to the mother seeking “a break” from the relationship.[46] she then decided, on her case, to leave the relationship permanently.[47] during her evidence at trial, she conceded that the father’s attitude had improved and he was given credit for the efforts that he had made to seek psychological assistance and undertake parenting courses.
181 i am not prepared to make an adverse finding against the father in relation to this consideration. although the father’s attitude did not meet the mother’s expectations and could have been better, it is relevant that the parents were inexperienced young parents of small infants. based on their evidence, it seems that they each likely did their best in their respective roles in the family unit.
182 i find that the mother and father were each seeking to navigate their new roles as parents, having different styles and approaches. the father’s approach and degree of involvement was influenced by the agreed arrangement within the relationship that the mother would be the primary carer.
183 i accept that at times the mother felt unsupported, worn out and had difficulty coping, but the mother preferred to be in charge and rejected the father’s attempts to help at times.[48]
family violence
184 the assertion that the father committed family violence during the relationship was pressed significantly in the mother’s case. in the mother’s case outline and closing, the contention was put that the court should make a finding that the father committed family violence and, in turn, this rebuts the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility.[49]
185 the evidence of the parties demonstrates a contest about important facts which are of relevance to the question of family violence and the consideration in sections 60cc(3)(j) and 61da of the act. the contest related to: whether the father perpetrated family violence in the relationship, and what caused the mother to separate and if she told the father that she was separating from him before she relocated to tasmania, and whether the father agreed to the mother relocating to tasmania and, if so, whether the agreement was to temporary or permanent relocation.
186 the evidence about alleged family violence perpetrated by the father came before the court in essentially three ways: first, the mother’s affidavit filed 4 january 2022, second, documents tendered from the joint tender bundle (particularly the domestic violence protection order and the affidavit to police[50]), and, third, her evidence given under cross examination.
187 i have carefully considered this evidence and am troubled by some inconsistencies in the evidence and the impact that has on the reliability of the mother’s claims.
188 the inconsistency is that the mother conceded in cross examination that the first and only time the father had been physically abusive towards her was the beach incident in 2015. however, the mother sought to convey otherwise in her trial affidavit at [28] and [29] and statements in her police affidavit, as she refers to “occasions” in plural. in cross examination, although the mother maintained the father had made threats to hit her, she agreed she had not given any context to this. although there was opportunity to clarify this evidence on re-examination, that did not occur.
189 despite claiming in evidence and to police that she was fearful due to the incident at the beach, when the mother completed the parent domestic violence inventory (“dvi”) assessment on 20 november 2018, she indicated that she was not afraid of the father.[51] furthermore, in the same document she indicated that in the previous 12 months, the father had not kicked, punched or otherwise hurt her, consistent with her evidence under cross-examination, but not consistent with the plural used in her affidavit and the claimed threats to hit her.
190 in the dvi assessment questionnaire, her reports were confined to the father having put down, humiliated or tried to control her, and threatened to hurt her. no specifics are identified about this and the mother did not provide more than generalised evidence in her affidavits, except to give minimal examples.
191 in the contemporaneous notes taken by a child health nurse on 17 october 2018 about one month prior to completion of dvi questionnaire, the mother did not report any physical assault or threat to hit or hurt by the father, nor fear of him. the subject matter of the mother’s concerns regarding the father at that time related to the father’s “lack of ability or willingness to help when needed and when he does help, it is more of a hindrance”.[52] indeed, the entry made by the nurse, which was relied upon by both parties, indicated that the mother admitted she was short tempered and shouted at the father. although relationship counselling was apparently recommended, that was noted to be for “transition to parenting, changes for [the father] and [the mother], lack of sleep impact on mental health”.
192 the next progress note of 23 october 2018, also in evidence, indicated similar concerns that the mother was having difficulty coping as she was primarily responsible for the elder child and the father was not present to assist.[53]
193 a further progress note of 20 november 2018 was created at the same time the dvi assessment questionnaire was completed.[54] it identifies that this is the first occasion on which the mother raises concerns about behaviour of the father which may be capable of being interpreted as coercive or controlling behaviours. the note made by the registered nurse appearing at page 9 of the joint bundle suggests that the mother’s own experience growing up in her parents’ household with a father who was controlling towards her mother and herself has to some degree informed the mother’s attitude towards the father. i consider it significant that at that time the mother was reporting not being fearful of the father.
194 based on the foregoing, i prefer the evidence of the father about what occurred at the beach in february 2015 and i am satisfied that the father has not ever physically abused, hit or assaulted the mother. it seems likely to have been a playful exchange, perceived as such at the time.
195 the vast majority of the mother’s evidence appeared to amount to allegations of emotional abuse based on coercive or controlling behaviours on the father’s part. in summary, they are alleged to have included:  hiding documents,[55] (b) locking the mother out of the house (with or without the elder child),[56] (c) taking the mother’s keys to prevent her going out, (d) derogatory statements,[57] (e) telling the children that the mother was going to leave or would reject them,[58] (f) picking up the children before the mother and preventing the mother from comforting them,[59] (g) sending threatening messages on the mother’s social media account to the mother’s sister pretending to be the mother,[60] (h) restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   locking the mother out of the house (with or without the elder child),[56] (c) taking the mother’s keys to prevent her going out, (d) derogatory statements,[57] (e) telling the children that the mother was going to leave or would reject them,[58] (f) picking up the children before the mother and preventing the mother from comforting them,[59] (g) sending threatening messages on the mother’s social media account to the mother’s sister pretending to be the mother,[60] (h) restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   taking the mother’s keys to prevent her going out, (d) derogatory statements,[57] (e) telling the children that the mother was going to leave or would reject them,[58] (f) picking up the children before the mother and preventing the mother from comforting them,[59] (g) sending threatening messages on the mother’s social media account to the mother’s sister pretending to be the mother,[60] (h) restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   derogatory statements,[57] (e) telling the children that the mother was going to leave or would reject them,[58] (f) picking up the children before the mother and preventing the mother from comforting them,[59] (g) sending threatening messages on the mother’s social media account to the mother’s sister pretending to be the mother,[60] (h) restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   telling the children that the mother was going to leave or would reject them,[58] (f) picking up the children before the mother and preventing the mother from comforting them,[59] (g) sending threatening messages on the mother’s social media account to the mother’s sister pretending to be the mother,[60] (h) restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   picking up the children before the mother and preventing the mother from comforting them,[59] (g) sending threatening messages on the mother’s social media account to the mother’s sister pretending to be the mother,[60] (h) restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   sending threatening messages on the mother’s social media account to the mother’s sister pretending to be the mother,[60] (h) restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   restricting the mother’s access to money,[61] (i) pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   pressuring or tricking the mother to have sex,[62] and (j) isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]   isolating the mother from her friends and family.[63]
196 regarding all of her evidence about these allegations, the mother agreed in cross examination that no specific dates and little detail of incidents had been provided. however, there is some detail about an episode when the mother was locked from the house when the father agrees he took the mother’s keys to work unknowingly and evidence by the mother that on one occasion relating to hiding a rates notice. the father’s explanations about these specific events are credible, plausible and consistent with ordinary family life.
197 documents in evidence show that in july 2019, the mother sought counselling concerning her experience of alleged family violence.[64] the notes on page 3 of the joint tender bundle reference a psychologist assisting with relationship counselling having suggested the mother call the domestic violence prevention centre. the mother’s evidence confirms that relationship counselling occurred,[65] but the mother’s account of the counsellor’s advice carries little weight. it is hearsay and the counsellor was not called at trial. another notation in the same record refers to “[the maternal grandmother] in process of divorcing [the maternal grandfather], who used violence toward [the maternal grandmother] but is residing in the us”.
198 the following month, the mother completed a second dvi assessment with f hospital.[66] on 13 august 2019, the mother reported that she was afraid of the father and that there had been no incidents where he had hit, kicked, punched or otherwise hurt her in the last year, but that there continued to be put downs, humiliation, control and threats to hurt.
199 these responses by the mother in august 2019 are further informed by the contemporaneous notes made by a registered nurse at the health assessment conducted on the same day.[67] at this time, the mother was attending for a 20 month health assessment for the elder child and was pregnant and due to give birth to the younger child. again, there is reference to the mother discussing domestic violence with the maternal grandmother who is separated from the maternal grandfather. the only reference to the alleged behaviours of the father is “her partner does things she asked him not to do and then laughs.” the mother’s reports were mainly of concerns about the elder child’s speech and behaviours, described as placing objects in her bottom when having a shower with the mother and objecting to persons other than the mother changing her nappy.
200 these concerns, referred to during the hearing as sexualised behaviour, were not pursued as allegations of abuse by the father. they were abandoned and the mother appears to have accepted that what was occurring was not indicative of abuse by the father.[68]
201 there is no evidence before the court which convincingly explains the basis upon which the mother was not afraid of the father in 2018 but became afraid in 2019. her own reports were that for the two years before august 2019, the father had not hit, kicked, punched or otherwise hurt her.
202 at its highest and lacking many particulars, the mother’s generalised assertions of family violence are not persuasive. further, there is a degree of inconsistency between what the mother claimed prior to and at separation and then since about the father’s conduct. the state of the evidence causes me to consider that the mother has exaggerated the nature and extent of the father’s conduct during the relationship or been influenced by others to regard it as family violence.[69]
203 i am satisfied that on an indeterminate number of occasion, the father made hurtful statements towards the mother. for example, calling the mother “chubby”. however, the evidence does not persuade me that there were repeated derogatory taunts which caused fear or were controlling.
204 concerning the allegations of financial control, the mother has failed to persuade me that the father did exert such control.[70] it is telling that the mother conceded that she had access to all of the bank accounts and there is evidence in the form of bank statements indicative of the mother routinely making withdrawals from the accounts.[71]
205 in relation to the allegation of coercive control based on tricking the mother into having sex or pressuring her to have sex, the mother’s evidence pertains to the period during her pregnancy with the elder child in 2017 and later when the parties were contemplating having a second child before the younger child’s birth in 2019. in none of the reports made about domestic violence in 2018 and 2019 referred to above, did the mother make reference to being forced, pressured or tricked to have sex. in light of the seriousness of such an allegation, it is inconceivable that it would not have been mentioned if it occurred when completing the dvi questionnaire. accordingly, i do not accept these allegations, particularly in light of the concession by the mother that when she asked the father to stop during sex, he did so.
206 the mother alleges that the father told the children that the mother would reject them and was leaving them. i find this evidence unpersuasive. the mother does not give evidence as to the timeframe in respect of which these things were alleged to have been said to the children. there is no direct evidence that the mother ever made a threat to leave, rather the mother said she was having a break.
207 in relation to the allegation that the father would not permit the mother to comfort the children, i do not accept the allegation as reliable. the contemporaneous and direct report of the mother to the child health nurse referred to at [191] of these reasons, by inference, is consistent with the father’s evidence that the mother would intervene and take over.
208 as to the allegation that the father engaged in coercive and controlling behaviours by isolating the mother from friends and family, i reject the proposition. it is evident that the mother enjoyed a close relationship with the maternal grandmother. she was welcome in the parties’ home and attended and participated in the children’s lives until the mother moved out from the family home. it would appear that the mother was not particularly close to her sister, did not have a close relationship with her father until relatively recently, and has given no evidence about the friends with whom she would otherwise have had relationships. her evidence simply does not convince to the requisite standard of persuasion.[72]
209 i did not find persuasive the mother’s evidence about the father hiding documents, locking her outside the house and taking her car keys to be a form of coercive control. there may have been a few incidents of such nature as specifically exampled in the mother’s evidence, but i am not satisfied on the balance probabilities that the father repeatedly engaged in such behaviour. more likely, these incidents were inadvertent and rare, misconstrued by the mother and not explained or communicated adequately by the father at the time. this is also consistent with the finding in the paragraph below.
210 given the father’s evidence and multiple concessions during cross-examination, it is plain and i find that he had a tendency to withdraw as a means of avoiding disagreement or conflict. on an indeterminate number of occasions, i find the mother was given the silent treatment or issues between them were not resolved to her satisfaction.
211 regarding the evidence called from the mother’s psychologist, i find his opinions about the nature of the father’s conduct towards the mother and its impact on her unpersuasive. in my view, his opinions and the content of his report fail to satisfy the requirements discussed in makita (australia) pty limited v sprowles (2001) 52 nswr 705 and dasreef pty limited v hawchar [2011] hca 21, and do not constitute expert opinion the court should give material weight. statements in the mother’s psychologist’s own report refer to him having formed the view without any information from the father or observing the children themselves. accordingly, he relies on interpretations given by the mother to events which i have not fully accepted or preferred. i give the views of the mother’s psychologist little weight.
212 finally, there is evidence of a family violence order having been made to protect the mother against the father. i do not accept that its existence alone establishes the fact that the father perpetrated family violence towards the mother, when there was no testing of the evidence or findings when the order was made. further, the father stated he did not contest the application at the insistence of the mother.[73] the father’s explanation about why he did not contest the application is convincing. he clearly wanted the relationship to continue, and he was shocked and surprised by the fact the police were involved. having observed the father giving evidence and noting his concessions about avoidance of conflict by withdrawal, i accept he took the path of least resistance.
213 i found the mother’s denial under cross examination of the father’s evidence referred to at [212] unconvincing. her denials do not sit comfortably with the sequence of events and other findings relevant to the father’s conflict avoidance.
214 further, the mother’s claim to the father that she was required to provide information to the police as part of a mandatory report is not borne out by the evidence. the domestic violence protection order was initiated by her email to queensland police.[74] this finding is reinforced by the content of notes made by the mother’s psychologist and tendered in evidence.[75] the notes reveal that the mother ceased contact with dvpc in august 2019 and subsequently, spoke with the maternal grandmother and maternal grandfather who reinforced beliefs that the father had behaved inappropriately and contributed to her deciding to leave the relationship. for example, the notes refer to the maternal grandfather’s “belief that [the father] is hiding $”, “[the maternal grandfather]’s concern for [the mother’s] situation”, “[the maternal grandfather]’s support of [the mother]” and “[friend] ms z...+ also [the maternal great grandmother]...both concerned”.
215 by april and may 2020, the mother was planning to separate and not being open, but instead portrayed that she was simply on a “break”.[76] she also misrepresented the incident with the younger child and the high chair, telling her psychologist and the court that the father was unconcerned,[77] but the text messages from him show otherwise.[78]
216 during this “break”, the father was frequently and regularly spending time with the children and the mother. this and the content of text communications exchanged do not portray the mother being in fear of the father. it is highly unlikely, given her cautious nature, that she would have permitted the father to continue spending time with the children and visit the maternal grandfather’s accommodation where she was staying if she feared him.
217 for all the foregoing reasons, i have not been persuaded that the father perpetrated family violence towards the mother.
218 further, the mother did not pursue claims of abuse or family violence by the father against the children.
determination and orders
219 these are parenting proceedings with disputes that involve questions of whether the mother’s relocation to tasmania should be permitted in the long term. i am required to evaluate the competing proposals by the parties concerning all issues in dispute, assessing the relevant considerations, and ultimately determine what is likely to be in the best interests of the children.[79]
220 the mother claims that the relocation should be sanctioned permanently and that she ought to have sole parental responsibility because of family violence and other reasons.
221 i have found that there were likely misunderstandings between the parties arising from their day-to-day life in a household with two young children, with high demands and inconsistent expectations of each parent of the other.[80]
222 i have rejected the allegations against the father of family violence.[81] the unresolved disagreements, different expectations and style of communication understandably caused tensions. however, while repeated derogatory taunts may constitute family violence,[82] i have found in this case that they were hurtful, but did not cause fear or coerce or control.[83] there is no persuasive evidence of repeated derogatory taunts that might in particular circumstances satisfy the meaning of family violence in section 4ab(d) of the act.
223 accordingly, no live issue exists about the need to prioritise protection of the children from the type of harm referred to in section 60cc(2)(b) over a meaningful relationship with either parent.[84]
224 i do not accept the proposition advanced in the mother’s case that her perceptions alone of various incidents and conduct by the father, rather than findings of fact based on evidence before the court, is determinative of whether family violence actually occurred. i was not referred to a specific authority supportive of this. my own review of authority and the statutory meaning attributed to family violence does not support the proposition.
225 the statutory definition of family violence in section 4ab of the act provides:

226 the terms of subsection (1) of the definition must be satisfied on the evidence. it comprises two alternative elements: any behaviour that coerces or controls another family member, or any behaviour that causes the family member to be fearful.
227 subsection (2) provides a non-exhaustive list of examples of behaviour that may constitute family violence. it does not give family violence an additional or other meaning beyond subsection (1). the exampled behaviours must have in fact occurred, and they must cause fear or coerce in order to constitute family violence. this arises from the plain words of the provision.
228 i do not ignore that the fact that the mother had some pre-existing emotional vulnerability and experienced some of the father’s remarks negatively. however, i also consider that there was inconsistency between the mother’s portrayal of events when they occurred and during her evidence at trial. the mother has been influenced by her family members to regard her circumstances as the same or parallel to that of her parents’ relationship and their labelling of it as family violence. however, there is no evidence about what her parents’ behaviours were. the maternal grandmother being called, did not give detail. the maternal grandfather was not called.
229 it is also quite possible that the mother’s evidence has been coloured or skewed to justify her actions in relocating to tasmania permanently because her family has made it financially and practically inviting to do so. this is not to say that the mother sought to deliberately mislead. instead, i consider that her memory and interpretation of events is not reliable. generally, i prefer the father’s evidence, given his willingness to make frank and open concession, even when they did not suit his case. his evidence was also internally consistent.
230 not being satisfied that the father perpetrated family violence, the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility applies. there should be an order in those terms. the views of the family reporter also support the order being made. although the father has in the past withdrawn from communication about some issues, the evidence now before the court demonstrates that he has:  addressed the trait and sought appropriate psychological treatment, (b) capacity to hear the mother’s proposals, for example, about school and childcare, and then cooperates or defers to make joint decisions, and (c) is willing to be guided by the mother, whom he accepts: (i) is a good mother, (ii) has assumed the primary parenting role, and (iii) has the children’s best interests in mind when making decisions.   capacity to hear the mother’s proposals, for example, about school and childcare, and then cooperates or defers to make joint decisions, and (c) is willing to be guided by the mother, whom he accepts: (i) is a good mother, (ii) has assumed the primary parenting role, and (iii) has the children’s best interests in mind when making decisions.   is willing to be guided by the mother, whom he accepts: (i) is a good mother, (ii) has assumed the primary parenting role, and (iii) has the children’s best interests in mind when making decisions.   is a good mother, (ii) has assumed the primary parenting role, and (iii) has the children’s best interests in mind when making decisions.  ) has assumed the primary parenting role, and (iii) has the children’s best interests in mind when making decisions.  i) has the children’s best interests in mind when making decisions.
return of the children to queensland?
231 the required assessment in this case is made more challenging because of the factual dispute about whether the father acquiesced to the mother and the children coming to tasmania only because he understood the arrangement was temporary. there is ample authority for the proposition that the court usually does not condone unilateral action effecting relocation.[85]
232 as the father did not engage in family violence and does not pose an unacceptable risk, the assessment of the countervailing considerations in s.60cc (3) are particularly relevant in the required decision making pathways and application of principles set out at [126] to [137] of these reasons.
233 there was an abundance of evidence, most of which was undisturbed following cross-examination, demonstrating that the children are settled, in routines, progressing normally developmentally and are content. this is probably due to the passage of time, the mother’s primary care role including good organisation of the children’s lives and the financial and other support from the mother’s paternal extended family.
234 this evidence was in effect what swayed the family reporter to change his recommendation from that expressed in the family report during evidence at the trial.[86] he no longer recommended that the children return to queensland, essentially because of the settled and stable situation in tasmania for the children, the practical/financial advantages and the improvement in the father’s relationship with the children. he also considered that the father could continue to have a meaningful relationship with the children by exercising substantial and significant time with them from his base in queensland.
235 by comparison, there was very little evidence of what the children’s lives and arrangements would be like if they returned to live either where the father resides in suburb aa or in the city c area, closer to the maternal grandmother.
236 there was some evidence about the home where the father lived and where the children would spend time with him and their paternal grandmother, aunt and cousins. lacking, was highly relevant evidence about appropriate options for the school/child care the children would attend, what out of school care arrangements could be made noting that the mother may seek employment to pursue her career at some stage, and the location and nature of housing for the children if they lived with the mother in queensland.
237 the mother’s case addressed the difficulties with accommodation and the costs of it, the travel time involved to facilitate time between the children and the father if they returned to queensland. the father’s case did not address if and how these difficulties could be overcome.
238 although it might be open to infer that the mother’s extended family would assist financially and practically, perhaps paying removalists or paying rent for the mother, there was no clarity supported by evidence about how they would do so. i consider the onus was on the father to adduce this evidence from the maternal great-grandmother when cross-examined and that did not occur.
239 the absence of evidence described at [235] and [238], leaves the court unable to favourably evaluate the father’s alternative proposal. in comparison, the evidence supporting the mother’s proposal was extensive, including providing means to overcome the practical barriers of facilitating the father’s increased time with the children if they remain in tasmania.
240 in cross-examination of the family reporter and the mother, counsel for the father obtained a concession that it was possible that the mother could make suitable living arrangements in queensland. this concession of “possibility” in abstract leaves me unpersuaded that returning the children to queensland, as opposed to ensuring that they spend significant time with the father while living in tasmania, is in their best interests.
241 i have preferred the evidence of the father, to the effect that his agreement to the mother and the children coming to tasmania was on the basis that it was to be temporary and for the duration of the mother’s practical placement. the content of the text message from the mother to the father, despite the mother’s denial in cross-examination, corroborates the father’s evidence that the mother had initially stated that their relationship was “on a break”.
242 the mother decided not to return to queensland either before leaving or soon after arriving in tasmania. it is unnecessary for me to make a finding as to which because, in either case, i am satisfied that the father only agreed to the children travelling to tasmania and living here temporarily.
243 for the reasons at [241] and [242] and because i have rejected that the father perpetrated family violence, i have been reluctant to refuse the father’s application to make an order to return the children to queensland, but the court is required to make a determination about the children’s best interests now. regrettably the passage of time and evidentiary gaps has disadvantaged the father’s case.
244 accordingly, the court is not satisfied that it is in the children’s best interests to return to queensland, noting the findings. as the father does not intend to move to tasmania, the children are permitted to live with the mother in tasmania.
245 there was discourse between counsel and the bench during closing submissions about the power of the court to make orders requiring a party to live in or relocate to a particular location. counsel for the mother in essence submitted that the court has such a power, citing sampson & hartnett (no 10) [2007] famca 1365 and other more recent authorities approving of it. however, she submitted that the power should not be exercised in this case. counsel for the father in essence submitted that although the court may have the power, ordinarily it is rarely exercised. he did not submit that the power should be exercised in this case.
246 as i have concluded that the children should not be returned to queensland, it is unnecessary to deal with the submissions about the court’s power to make orders that a party live in a particular place. there did not appear to be any material disagreement about the law, but each counsel placed slightly different emphasis on whether the court should exercise the power in particular cases.
father’s spend time arrangement with children
247 the court is persuaded that the father should spend more time with the children than that contended by the mother, because: i accept the updated views of the family reporter, i am satisfied that the strengthening, positive and loving relationship the children have with the father and that they miss him, will continue to promote a mutually meaningful and beneficial relationship at distance, there is no evidence that the father poses a risk of harm to the children, i have found he did not commit family violence, this will promote the opportunities for the children’s positive and important relationships with the paternal grandmother, aunt and extended family in queensland generally, and the financial and practical barriers to enable more frequent time have been significantly minimised by the court being prepared to accept the evidence of the maternal great grandmother.
248 the determination that the parents have equal shared parental responsibility requires the court to consider equal time or otherwise significant and substantial time. there are practical difficulties due to distance and the father’s employment that preclude equal time. however, there should be more time than proposed by the mother to ensure that the father’s time is of a frequency and duration to preserve and promote a meaningful and beneficial relationship for the children as they mature and age.
249 opportunity for the father to participate in weekday and extra-curriculum activities should be allowed.[87] as the mother conceded that the father does not pose an unacceptable risk to the children, there will be orders for unsupervised time overnight immediately and gradually building. in addition there will be time and communication on special occasions, christmas and school holidays once the children are both attending school.
250 i do not accept the evidence and submissions by the mother that the father’s time should not immediately progress to overnight time. this was not supported by the family reporter and the mother had previously consented to interim orders for overnight time. i found the mother’s evidence about the children not coping with overnight time unpersuasive. their coping capacity has not been allowed to be demonstrated and the now stronger relationship the father has with them likely means they will cope. the further evidence of the maternal great-grandmother referred to above at [96] supports this conclusion. so too do the views of the family reporter,[88] which i accept.
251 regarding the claim that overnight time for the younger child was not possible because he was not weaned, i reject it. no party called expert or objective evidence about this topic. i consider the onus was on the mother to provide evidence to justify her subjective view that he could not now be weaned without detriment. the mother likely needs support to adjust to the children being with the father for longer periods.
252 the mother’s attitude to longer and overnight time may be influenced by past tendency to anxiousness and habits of being the primary carer to date. as the mother’s psychological state is improved since being in tasmania, there is no valid reason to limit the father’s time with the children to daytime only. the impact on the primary carer of a parenting order for unsupervised or increased is a proper matter to consider for the purposes of determining what order should be made pursuant to 64b and 65daa of the act.[89] however, the factual circumstances of this case are clearly distinguishable to those where courts have been persuaded to limit time or require it to be supervised. there is no compelling expert evidence supporting the mother’s position and i consider that the mother’s concerns are without merit based on findings made elsewhere in these reasons.[9]
253 no or limited attention was given in the father’s case to justify making an order restraining the mother from leaving the children in the unsupervised care of mr l. despite the submissions in the father’s case outline, the evidence of the mother and the maternal grandmother that mr l committed family violence is assertion not evidence. it is without factual context or supporting evidence. the mother now has a relationship with her father, and there is no suggestion she would not act protectively of the children.
254 i am satisfied that she would not leave the children alone with the maternal grandfather if she considered there to be a real concern or threat. given her concerns and actions about the elder child’s perceived sexualised behaviours, it is evident that she has an attuned radar and suspicion when it comes the wellbeing of the children. i am not persuaded the order should be made.
255 in the father’s case outline he sought orders relating to the issue of passports for the children and provision for overseas travel. the mother sought no orders in this regard and the issue was not agitated during the hearing.
