(aa) on 3 april 2015, while the father proposed to take the children to nsw, they remained in city b and his parents visited them for 2 days there. (bb) on 23 june 2015, final consent parenting orders (“the final orders”) were made by judge coker in the, then, federal circuit court of australia. those orders were made at a time when the mother was living in city b and the father in nsw. there was a notation to the final orders that the mother did not have, at that stage, concrete plans to relocate but, if opportunities arose for her and/or she wished to relocate with the children, the father would not unreasonably withhold his consent if the relocation did not affect his time with the children, to the effect, that the agreed spend time orders were intended to apply to the town in which the mother and the children lived. relevantly, the final orders also provided for the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility for the children, the children would live with the mother and spend defined time with the father. at that stage the mother and the children lived in city b and the father lived in region s in the region g region.

(gg) in or around 2018, the mother asserted that she had taken x to a gp for a check-up and that x had stated to the gp that the father had hit her so hard on the backside that it had caused a bruise. the mother maintained that, following x’s consultation, the gp stated that he would make a report to child safety and referred x to a psychologist. the father disputed the mother’s assertions, in that regard. (hh) on 17 october 2018, the paternal grandmother, ms l, attended the mother’s then residence at w street, town v, nsw and observed, what she described as, “unhygienic living conditions”. (ii) on 9 july 2019, the children commenced living with the father on a full-time basis. the mother maintained that this was a temporary and experimental position. the father maintained that this was a permanent position. the mother asserted that she had based her decision to implement this arrangement on 2 factors: first, that the father had been trying to influence the children to live with him and that she had wanted to stop that pressure and secondly, because x was struggling at the town v school. the father asserted that the mother had told him that she could not control the children and wanted them to live with him, as she was afraid she would hit them and not be able to stop. ms m asserted that the mother had told her that she had to return to city b for her mental health, as she had support systems there, and because she did not like the cold weather in nsw. mr n said, inter alia, that they also missed the fishing in city b. the court accepts that both parties sought to ensure that there was some commitment to their arrangement but the issue as to whether it was permanent or temporary still had to be assessed by them in terms of the children coping with it. in order to assess whether the children were coping, both parties agreed that they would commit to the position but failed to agree on any specific time period for that assessment or review to be concluded, hence the difference in opinion as to “permanent” versus “temporary”. (jj) in august 2019, the mother informed the father that she had decided to return to city b with mr n and u. (kk) in september 2019, the mother relocated back to city b, qld with mr n and u and the children then spent 10 days in city b with them during the september/october school holiday period. the mother agreed that this was an expensive exercise which could have been avoided had she stayed in nsw for the balance of that school holiday period. (ll) in december 2019, while the children were scheduled to spend holidays with the mother, the children did not spend that time. the mother maintained that this was because she had no finances to enable the children to travel up to city b to spend time with her. the mother informed x that she was not going to spend time with the children and x informed the mother that she was, otherwise, “okay” with that as she could spend time with her friends in nsw. there was no recorded response by y.

(qq) on 22 july 2020, the mother received a letter from the father’s solicitors requesting the urgent return of y. in response, the mother advised, on 23 july 2020, that she was attempting to organise mediation and that she would not be returning y to the father in the meantime.

(ll) in december 2019, while the children were scheduled to spend holidays with the mother, the children did not spend that time. the mother maintained that this was because she had no finances to enable the children to travel up to city b to spend time with her. the mother informed x that she was not going to spend time with the children and x informed the mother that she was, otherwise, “okay” with that as she could spend time with her friends in nsw. there was no recorded response by y.

(cc) in 2016, the father commenced living in suburb t, nsw with his partner, ms m. the father continued to spend time with the children, substantially, during school holiday periods. (dd) in 2017, u (“u”) was born of the mother’s relationship with mr n and he is, currently, 4 years of age. (ee) in july 2017, the mother, mr n and u relocated to town v, region s, nsw, approximately, 90 minutes away from the father and ms m. x and y then attended town v school. the children then commenced spending alternate weekends with the father. (ff) in late 2017/early 2018, the mother asserted that, following the children’s visit with the father in suburb t, x had said words to the effect of: “ms m [ms m] dragged me up the flight of stairs in the unit by the arm”. the mother conceded that she did not raise this issue with the father or ms m because, she said, she did not wish to cause any conflict. ms m maintained that she did not drag x by the arm but had taken her by the arm and led her to sit in her room for a period of “time out”. (gg) in or around 2018, the mother asserted that she had taken x to a gp for a check-up and that x had stated to the gp that the father had hit her so hard on the backside that it had caused a bruise. the mother maintained that, following x’s consultation, the gp stated that he would make a report to child safety and referred x to a psychologist. the father disputed the mother’s assertions, in that regard. (hh) on 17 october 2018, the paternal grandmother, ms l, attended the mother’s then residence at w street, town v, nsw and observed, what she described as, “unhygienic living conditions”. (ii) on 9 july 2019, the children commenced living with the father on a full-time basis. the mother maintained that this was a temporary and experimental position. the father maintained that this was a permanent position. the mother asserted that she had based her decision to implement this arrangement on 2 factors: first, that the father had been trying to influence the children to live with him and that she had wanted to stop that pressure and secondly, because x was struggling at the town v school. the father asserted that the mother had told him that she could not control the children and wanted them to live with him, as she was afraid she would hit them and not be able to stop. ms m asserted that the mother had told her that she had to return to city b for her mental health, as she had support systems there, and because she did not like the cold weather in nsw. mr n said, inter alia, that they also missed the fishing in city b. the court accepts that both parties sought to ensure that there was some commitment to their arrangement but the issue as to whether it was permanent or temporary still had to be assessed by them in terms of the children coping with it. in order to assess whether the children were coping, both parties agreed that they would commit to the position but failed to agree on any specific time period for that assessment or review to be concluded, hence the difference in opinion as to “permanent” versus “temporary”. (jj) in august 2019, the mother informed the father that she had decided to return to city b with mr n and u. (kk) in september 2019, the mother relocated back to city b, qld with mr n and u and the children then spent 10 days in city b with them during the september/october school holiday period. the mother agreed that this was an expensive exercise which could have been avoided had she stayed in nsw for the balance of that school holiday period. (ll) in december 2019, while the children were scheduled to spend holidays with the mother, the children did not spend that time. the mother maintained that this was because she had no finances to enable the children to travel up to city b to spend time with her. the mother informed x that she was not going to spend time with the children and x informed the mother that she was, otherwise, “okay” with that as she could spend time with her friends in nsw. there was no recorded response by y. (mm) in april 2020, due to covid-19 border closures between nsw and qld, the children did not spend any time with the mother. (nn) on 5 july 2020, the children flew to city b to spend time with the mother and were due to return to nsw on 18 july 2020.

(pp) on 18 july 2020, the mother took the children to the airport at city b. when y refused to board the aircraft, the mother permitted x to continue on the 5 hour flight to sydney, alone. the mother said that she was not going to force y onto the plane. the father spoke to both the mother and y by telephone. the mother retained y in her care and advised the father that y would not be returning. there was no evidence that the mother took any measures to have y return to the father’s residence at that time. the mother did not arrange for any counselling for y, at that time. (qq) on 22 july 2020, the mother received a letter from the father’s solicitors requesting the urgent return of y. in response, the mother advised, on 23 july 2020, that she was attempting to organise mediation and that she would not be returning y to the father in the meantime. (rr) on 23 july 2020, the mother enrolled y in the z school, without the consent of the father. (ss) on 24 july 2020, a mediation conference was arranged with the family relationship centre. no agreement was reached between the parties as the father did not attend that conference, as indicated by the s.60i certificate filed on 7 august 2020, although the father maintained that he did attend an intake session on that date. (tt) on 6 august 2020, the father commenced these proceedings. (uu) in 2020, ab (“ab”) was born of the mother’s relationship with mr n and he is, currently, 1 year of age.

(ww) between 9 april 2021 and 17 april 2021, x travelled to city b to spend time with the mother and y. (xx) on 17 april 2021, x telephoned the mother because, she said, the father and ms m had become upset with her because she had had her hair dyed, acrylic nails done and had gotten a belly button piercing which the mother had arranged for her on her 13th birthday when in city b, without the father’s consent. the mother asserted that x said to her: “dad and ms m [ms m] told me they were booking me a flight back to you on tuesday to city b and they said: “you will be uneducated and this will be all your mum’s fault”. the mother contacted the child safety helpline to make a report in response to this and arranged for her sister, “ms ac”, to collect x but, ultimately, x remained in the father’s care. the mother conceded that she did not talk to the father about this incident. (yy) between 26 june 2021 and 8 july 2021, x travelled to city b to spend time with the mother and y. y was unable to travel to nsw due to covid-19 lockdown provisions. (zz) in july 2021, the mother arranged for y to attend ao centre and y had a number of sessions of counselling. the mother said that there were 2 sessions. mr n said there had been 10 sessions.   on 8 august 2010, the mother attended the suburb p police station and made a statement to the police with respect to family violence. (k) on 15 september 2010, the mother sought a further advo against the father and an interim advo was issued as against him. (l) between october 2010 and october 2011, the father spent time with x on an alternate weekend basis and each wednesday afternoon. (m) in 2010, y was born of the parties’ relationship and she is, currently, 11 years of age. (n) on 25 october 2010, the local court of nsw dismissed the interim advo, as referred to in (k) above, as the mother indicated that she did not wish to pursue those proceedings any further.

(bb) on 23 june 2015, final consent parenting orders (“the final orders”) were made by judge coker in the, then, federal circuit court of australia. those orders were made at a time when the mother was living in city b and the father in nsw. there was a notation to the final orders that the mother did not have, at that stage, concrete plans to relocate but, if opportunities arose for her and/or she wished to relocate with the children, the father would not unreasonably withhold his consent if the relocation did not affect his time with the children, to the effect, that the agreed spend time orders were intended to apply to the town in which the mother and the children lived. relevantly, the final orders also provided for the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility for the children, the children would live with the mother and spend defined time with the father. at that stage the mother and the children lived in city b and the father lived in region s in the region g region. (cc) in 2016, the father commenced living in suburb t, nsw with his partner, ms m. the father continued to spend time with the children, substantially, during school holiday periods. (dd) in 2017, u (“u”) was born of the mother’s relationship with mr n and he is, currently, 4 years of age. (ee) in july 2017, the mother, mr n and u relocated to town v, region s, nsw, approximately, 90 minutes away from the father and ms m. x and y then attended town v school. the children then commenced spending alternate weekends with the father. (ff) in late 2017/early 2018, the mother asserted that, following the children’s visit with the father in suburb t, x had said words to the effect of: “ms m [ms m] dragged me up the flight of stairs in the unit by the arm”. the mother conceded that she did not raise this issue with the father or ms m because, she said, she did not wish to cause any conflict. ms m maintained that she did not drag x by the arm but had taken her by the arm and led her to sit in her room for a period of “time out”. (gg) in or around 2018, the mother asserted that she had taken x to a gp for a check-up and that x had stated to the gp that the father had hit her so hard on the backside that it had caused a bruise. the mother maintained that, following x’s consultation, the gp stated that he would make a report to child safety and referred x to a psychologist. the father disputed the mother’s assertions, in that regard. (hh) on 17 october 2018, the paternal grandmother, ms l, attended the mother’s then residence at w street, town v, nsw and observed, what she described as, “unhygienic living conditions”. (ii) on 9 july 2019, the children commenced living with the father on a full-time basis. the mother maintained that this was a temporary and experimental position. the father maintained that this was a permanent position. the mother asserted that she had based her decision to implement this arrangement on 2 factors: first, that the father had been trying to influence the children to live with him and that she had wanted to stop that pressure and secondly, because x was struggling at the town v school. the father asserted that the mother had told him that she could not control the children and wanted them to live with him, as she was afraid she would hit them and not be able to stop. ms m asserted that the mother had told her that she had to return to city b for her mental health, as she had support systems there, and because she did not like the cold weather in nsw. mr n said, inter alia, that they also missed the fishing in city b. the court accepts that both parties sought to ensure that there was some commitment to their arrangement but the issue as to whether it was permanent or temporary still had to be assessed by them in terms of the children coping with it. in order to assess whether the children were coping, both parties agreed that they would commit to the position but failed to agree on any specific time period for that assessment or review to be concluded, hence the difference in opinion as to “permanent” versus “temporary”. (jj) in august 2019, the mother informed the father that she had decided to return to city b with mr n and u. (kk) in september 2019, the mother relocated back to city b, qld with mr n and u and the children then spent 10 days in city b with them during the september/october school holiday period. the mother agreed that this was an expensive exercise which could have been avoided had she stayed in nsw for the balance of that school holiday period. (ll) in december 2019, while the children were scheduled to spend holidays with the mother, the children did not spend that time. the mother maintained that this was because she had no finances to enable the children to travel up to city b to spend time with her. the mother informed x that she was not going to spend time with the children and x informed the mother that she was, otherwise, “okay” with that as she could spend time with her friends in nsw. there was no recorded response by y. (mm) in april 2020, due to covid-19 border closures between nsw and qld, the children did not spend any time with the mother.

(qq) on 22 july 2020, the mother received a letter from the father’s solicitors requesting the urgent return of y. in response, the mother advised, on 23 july 2020, that she was attempting to organise mediation and that she would not be returning y to the father in the meantime. (rr) on 23 july 2020, the mother enrolled y in the z school, without the consent of the father. (ss) on 24 july 2020, a mediation conference was arranged with the family relationship centre. no agreement was reached between the parties as the father did not attend that conference, as indicated by the s.60i certificate filed on 7 august 2020, although the father maintained that he did attend an intake session on that date.

(ww) between 9 april 2021 and 17 april 2021, x travelled to city b to spend time with the mother and y. (xx) on 17 april 2021, x telephoned the mother because, she said, the father and ms m had become upset with her because she had had her hair dyed, acrylic nails done and had gotten a belly button piercing which the mother had arranged for her on her 13th birthday when in city b, without the father’s consent. the mother asserted that x said to her: “dad and ms m [ms m] told me they were booking me a flight back to you on tuesday to city b and they said: “you will be uneducated and this will be all your mum’s fault”. the mother contacted the child safety helpline to make a report in response to this and arranged for her sister, “ms ac”, to collect x but, ultimately, x remained in the father’s care. the mother conceded that she did not talk to the father about this incident. (yy) between 26 june 2021 and 8 july 2021, x travelled to city b to spend time with the mother and y. y was unable to travel to nsw due to covid-19 lockdown provisions.

(n) on 25 october 2010, the local court of nsw dismissed the interim advo, as referred to in (k) above, as the mother indicated that she did not wish to pursue those proceedings any further.

(ee) in july 2017, the mother, mr n and u relocated to town v, region s, nsw, approximately, 90 minutes away from the father and ms m. x and y then attended town v school. the children then commenced spending alternate weekends with the father. (ff) in late 2017/early 2018, the mother asserted that, following the children’s visit with the father in suburb t, x had said words to the effect of: “ms m [ms m] dragged me up the flight of stairs in the unit by the arm”. the mother conceded that she did not raise this issue with the father or ms m because, she said, she did not wish to cause any conflict. ms m maintained that she did not drag x by the arm but had taken her by the arm and led her to sit in her room for a period of “time out”. (gg) in or around 2018, the mother asserted that she had taken x to a gp for a check-up and that x had stated to the gp that the father had hit her so hard on the backside that it had caused a bruise. the mother maintained that, following x’s consultation, the gp stated that he would make a report to child safety and referred x to a psychologist. the father disputed the mother’s assertions, in that regard. (hh) on 17 october 2018, the paternal grandmother, ms l, attended the mother’s then residence at w street, town v, nsw and observed, what she described as, “unhygienic living conditions”. (ii) on 9 july 2019, the children commenced living with the father on a full-time basis. the mother maintained that this was a temporary and experimental position. the father maintained that this was a permanent position. the mother asserted that she had based her decision to implement this arrangement on 2 factors: first, that the father had been trying to influence the children to live with him and that she had wanted to stop that pressure and secondly, because x was struggling at the town v school. the father asserted that the mother had told him that she could not control the children and wanted them to live with him, as she was afraid she would hit them and not be able to stop. ms m asserted that the mother had told her that she had to return to city b for her mental health, as she had support systems there, and because she did not like the cold weather in nsw. mr n said, inter alia, that they also missed the fishing in city b. the court accepts that both parties sought to ensure that there was some commitment to their arrangement but the issue as to whether it was permanent or temporary still had to be assessed by them in terms of the children coping with it. in order to assess whether the children were coping, both parties agreed that they would commit to the position but failed to agree on any specific time period for that assessment or review to be concluded, hence the difference in opinion as to “permanent” versus “temporary”. (jj) in august 2019, the mother informed the father that she had decided to return to city b with mr n and u. (kk) in september 2019, the mother relocated back to city b, qld with mr n and u and the children then spent 10 days in city b with them during the september/october school holiday period. the mother agreed that this was an expensive exercise which could have been avoided had she stayed in nsw for the balance of that school holiday period. (ll) in december 2019, while the children were scheduled to spend holidays with the mother, the children did not spend that time. the mother maintained that this was because she had no finances to enable the children to travel up to city b to spend time with her. the mother informed x that she was not going to spend time with the children and x informed the mother that she was, otherwise, “okay” with that as she could spend time with her friends in nsw. there was no recorded response by y.

(ww) between 9 april 2021 and 17 april 2021, x travelled to city b to spend time with the mother and y. (xx) on 17 april 2021, x telephoned the mother because, she said, the father and ms m had become upset with her because she had had her hair dyed, acrylic nails done and had gotten a belly button piercing which the mother had arranged for her on her 13th birthday when in city b, without the father’s consent. the mother asserted that x said to her: “dad and ms m [ms m] told me they were booking me a flight back to you on tuesday to city b and they said: “you will be uneducated and this will be all your mum’s fault”. the mother contacted the child safety helpline to make a report in response to this and arranged for her sister, “ms ac”, to collect x but, ultimately, x remained in the father’s care. the mother conceded that she did not talk to the father about this incident. (yy) between 26 june 2021 and 8 july 2021, x travelled to city b to spend time with the mother and y. y was unable to travel to nsw due to covid-19 lockdown provisions.

(aa) on 3 april 2015, while the father proposed to take the children to nsw, they remained in city b and his parents visited them for 2 days there. (bb) on 23 june 2015, final consent parenting orders (“the final orders”) were made by judge coker in the, then, federal circuit court of australia. those orders were made at a time when the mother was living in city b and the father in nsw. there was a notation to the final orders that the mother did not have, at that stage, concrete plans to relocate but, if opportunities arose for her and/or she wished to relocate with the children, the father would not unreasonably withhold his consent if the relocation did not affect his time with the children, to the effect, that the agreed spend time orders were intended to apply to the town in which the mother and the children lived. relevantly, the final orders also provided for the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility for the children, the children would live with the mother and spend defined time with the father. at that stage the mother and the children lived in city b and the father lived in region s in the region g region.

(gg) in or around 2018, the mother asserted that she had taken x to a gp for a check-up and that x had stated to the gp that the father had hit her so hard on the backside that it had caused a bruise. the mother maintained that, following x’s consultation, the gp stated that he would make a report to child safety and referred x to a psychologist. the father disputed the mother’s assertions, in that regard.

(aa) on 3 april 2015, while the father proposed to take the children to nsw, they remained in city b and his parents visited them for 2 days there. (bb) on 23 june 2015, final consent parenting orders (“the final orders”) were made by judge coker in the, then, federal circuit court of australia. those orders were made at a time when the mother was living in city b and the father in nsw. there was a notation to the final orders that the mother did not have, at that stage, concrete plans to relocate but, if opportunities arose for her and/or she wished to relocate with the children, the father would not unreasonably withhold his consent if the relocation did not affect his time with the children, to the effect, that the agreed spend time orders were intended to apply to the town in which the mother and the children lived. relevantly, the final orders also provided for the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility for the children, the children would live with the mother and spend defined time with the father. at that stage the mother and the children lived in city b and the father lived in region s in the region g region.

(gg) in or around 2018, the mother asserted that she had taken x to a gp for a check-up and that x had stated to the gp that the father had hit her so hard on the backside that it had caused a bruise. the mother maintained that, following x’s consultation, the gp stated that he would make a report to child safety and referred x to a psychologist. the father disputed the mother’s assertions, in that regard.

expert evidence  the mother alleged that, throughout their relationship, the father was excessively controlling, yelled at her, belittled her and subjected her to physical abuse. she alleged that, in 2008, he had threatened to “tie a noose” around her neck and “throw [her] off the balcony”. she alleged that, in 2011, he had thrown her mobile phone in her face and “pushed” her down some steps before spitting in her face. the mother also alleged that the father, frequently, “yells” at the children and “gets up in their faces” and that he had once “dragged x up the stairs”. the father denied the mother’s claims regarding family violence. (b) the father alleged that the mother was neglectful of the children. he claimed that she was unable to manage their behaviours and did not assist the children in the completion of their homework tasks. he claimed that the maternal household was unhygienic and usually had no food. the mother denied the father’s claims regarding her care of the children. (c) the father alleged that the mother had bipolar disorder. the mother denied this. the court notes, however, that the mother agreed that she had been, recently, diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“adhd”). (d) the parents have, on occasion, been able to discuss the needs of the children. according to the mother, when she first relocated to city b in 2011, she and the father had negotiated a new parenting arrangement whereby the children would live with her in city b and spend school holidays with him in sydney. (e) from 2011 until 2017, the children lived in city b with the mother, after which time, the mother relocated to town v in nsw before returning to city b about 2 years later. in mid-2019, the children relocated to live with the father in nsw. the parents differ in their respective accounts of the reason for the children moving. the father claimed that the mother had asked him to have the children live with him because she was struggling to manage their behaviours. the mother claimed that she allowed the children to live with the father, partly, to appease him because, she said, he had been “working on the girls for ages” to convince them to live in his new house and, partly, because the children wanted to “try it”. she said that, at that time, both she and the father understood that this move would be temporary. the father said that, after the children spent the winter school holidays with the mother in city b, y had refused to get on the plane to return to nsw. he said: “she had a tantrum because she hadn’t seen her mother for 9 months”. he was critical of the mother in allowing y to remain in city b while x had no choice but to fly back to sydney alone. he said that this recent development had harmed his relationship with y, who he described as “a different child now” and had also harmed the relationship between y and x who, he said, was “disgusted” with y. the father said that it was traumatic for x to travel home alone, not knowing why y had not boarded the plane. the mother said that y had, suddenly, refused to board the plane at the last minute and that she did not want to traumatise her by forcing her onto the plane. she said that y had wanted to remain in city b with her and that, if x were to return to city b, she would settle in quickly as, she said, the children have well-established social and familial connections in city b, having lived there for some years already.

(e) from 2011 until 2017, the children lived in city b with the mother, after which time, the mother relocated to town v in nsw before returning to city b about 2 years later. in mid-2019, the children relocated to live with the father in nsw. the parents differ in their respective accounts of the reason for the children moving. the father claimed that the mother had asked him to have the children live with him because she was struggling to manage their behaviours. the mother claimed that she allowed the children to live with the father, partly, to appease him because, she said, he had been “working on the girls for ages” to convince them to live in his new house and, partly, because the children wanted to “try it”. she said that, at that time, both she and the father understood that this move would be temporary. the father said that, after the children spent the winter school holidays with the mother in city b, y had refused to get on the plane to return to nsw. he said: “she had a tantrum because she hadn’t seen her mother for 9 months”. he was critical of the mother in allowing y to remain in city b while x had no choice but to fly back to sydney alone. he said that this recent development had harmed his relationship with y, who he described as “a different child now” and had also harmed the relationship between y and x who, he said, was “disgusted” with y. the father said that it was traumatic for x to travel home alone, not knowing why y had not boarded the plane. the mother said that y had, suddenly, refused to board the plane at the last minute and that she did not want to traumatise her by forcing her onto the plane. she said that y had wanted to remain in city b with her and that, if x were to return to city b, she would settle in quickly as, she said, the children have well-established social and familial connections in city b, having lived there for some years already.

(f) y, then aged 10 years, presented as a bright amiable child. she was interviewed in the morning at the maternal home via microsoft teams. (g) y said that having 2 homes was “very annoying”. she said that: “mum’s house is a bit more safe because i know lots of people up here that i can talk to and they’re all fun”. y said that her relationship with the mother was “good”. she described the mother as “an amazing mum, really fun”. y said that she had her own room in the maternal household. she described her siblings as: “sometimes annoying”. about the mother’s partner, known to the family as “mr n”, y said that: “he’s probably the best step-dad i’ve ever had. he does stuff in the house and he’s good with the babies”. (h) y said that the father’s home was quite a lot bigger than the maternal home, which, she said, she found a bit daunting. she described the father as: “strict but not really”. y said that a difficulty for her, in the paternal home, was that her step-mother “tells me what to wear”. she said that she thought the father might “play favourites” with her and her sister, because: “he yells at x but not at me, i don’t know why”. (i) y said that, if it were up to her, x would return to live with her in city b. she said: “i want her back, i miss her”. y became very teary when talking about x. y said that, although she wanted to live in city b with the mother, she would still like to spend school holidays in nsw with the father. (j) x, then aged 12 years, presented as a forthright and mature young person. she was interviewed in the paternal home after school. x said that she had, recently, commenced high school which, she said, had been a good experience so far. (k) x said that she would prefer not to choose which home she lives in as it was a choice that might be “too difficult” to make. she said that it was difficult living across 2 homes in 2 different states. (l) x said that she got along well with the father and her step-mother but that she often argued with them both as well. she said: “there are more rules here than at mum’s”. (m) x said that she got along with all the members of the mother’s household and had a good relationship with the mother. about the maternal home, x said that it was sometimes “messy”, as alleged by the father, which she attributed to the mother having “2 babies under 3 (years)” which, she said, made it difficult to keep a home perfectly clean. x said that she was “a bit ocd” meaning that she liked her environment to be clean. she said, however, that she did not mind the mess made by her younger siblings and that she did not mind helping the mother clean up when she was there. (n) about the time in 2020 when she returned to sydney alone and y remained in city b, x said that she “cried for like a week” when that happened. x said that she missed y “a lot, like on a scale of one to ten, a hundred”. x said that her main worry was being separated from y. she said that she would be happy living in either home as long as it was with y. x said: “i don’t mind where i live. if she [y] doesn’t come back in the next year or so i’m going to have to go back up because i’m really struggling to stay down here, without her”. (o) x said that she wished the adults would “sort things out” and “stop fighting”. she said that, she believed, that the mother’s partner, “mr n” has now “been pulled into this” and that allegations have been made regarding “mr n”, possibly, “being on drugs” which, she said, could not be true. x said that “mr n” was “amazing” and she became quite distraught and teary, at this point. ms k sat with x for a few minutes at the end of the interview to give her time to regain her composure. x talked happily about her interests in music and arts and showed a beautiful piece that she was, currently, working on. (p) ms k stated the following in terms of her evaluation and made the following recommendations: (i) the parents remain entrenched in their respective positions and it would seem that there was no room for negotiability on either part as far as the parenting arrangements for x and y were concerned, which placed the children in a very difficult position. (ii) the parents’ proposals would see the children either separated from one parent during the school term or separated from each other for most of the time. (iii) serious concerns continued to be held about the children living apart and separated by a distance of, approximately, 2,000 kilometres (according to google maps). (iv) the primary issue for both x and y was their relationship with each other and they clearly missed each other more than either of the parents realised. (v) if the children continue to live separately there is a real risk of their relationship diminishing over time. this would be highly concerning given the importance of sibling relationships throughout the lifespan. further to this, there are 2 younger half-siblings in the maternal home, who must be considered in any future parenting arrangement. (vi) the children’s relationships with each parent are quite positive and have withstood the various separations and living arrangements over the years since the parents separated. having said that, it appears that x and y have each been separated from one parent or the other for some years now and both have likely experienced some sense of personal loss around this situation. both children have been navigating a difficult situation for a significant period of time now. (vii) given that their relationships with each parent would appear to be well-established, it may be that allowing the girls to prioritise their relationship with each other is the most appropriate course of action now. (viii) x seems to be open to living with either parent, while y wants to remain in city b. the 2 younger half-siblings may be one reason why y would prefer to remain in city b. if the parents continue to live a significant distance apart, the children would, ideally, both live primarily in either the maternal or paternal home and spend time with the other parent during school holidays. given the level of parental conflict as well as the geographical distance separating x and y, their relationship with each other may have become, particularly, important to them. (ix) if the parents continue to keep the children separated, the children’s relationships with each of them may also become at risk over time. (x) the poor co-parenting relationship would seem to be another emotional burden the children are, currently, dealing with. x, in particular, seemed distressed by this. x seemed to have identified a new development in the parenting dispute, that of possible allegations against the mother’s partner, “mr n”, which, she said, she found clearly upsetting. x’s comment about the maternal home being “messy” was a further indication of her heightened awareness of the parent’s dispute. both children seemed to have been exposed to sustained parental conflict over several years. if this paradigm continues, the relationships between the children and each parent are at risk of deteriorating over time. (xi) delaying a decision whereby the children live in one household was not in their best interests, as would be the case if the legal proceedings extended over a number of years. (xii) the children may benefit if the parents participate in post-separation parenting education programme. (xiii) it was difficult to envision how any further assessment would assist x and y, given their very clear expressions of their current thoughts and feelings. given that the children would appear to have very positive relationships with members of their family in both households, observations would likely simply reflect this view.   in addition to the concerns identified by the father in paragraph 34(b), above, the father claimed that the mother had denigrated him to the children, particularly x.

(g) y said that having 2 homes was “very annoying”. she said that: “mum’s house is a bit more safe because i know lots of people up here that i can talk to and they’re all fun”. y said that her relationship with the mother was “good”. she described the mother as “an amazing mum, really fun”. y said that she had her own room in the maternal household. she described her siblings as: “sometimes annoying”. about the mother’s partner, known to the family as “mr n”, y said that: “he’s probably the best step-dad i’ve ever had. he does stuff in the house and he’s good with the babies”. (h) y said that the father’s home was quite a lot bigger than the maternal home, which, she said, she found a bit daunting. she described the father as: “strict but not really”. y said that a difficulty for her, in the paternal home, was that her step-mother “tells me what to wear”. she said that she thought the father might “play favourites” with her and her sister, because: “he yells at x but not at me, i don’t know why”. (i) y said that, if it were up to her, x would return to live with her in city b. she said: “i want her back, i miss her”. y became very teary when talking about x. y said that, although she wanted to live in city b with the mother, she would still like to spend school holidays in nsw with the father. (j) x, then aged 12 years, presented as a forthright and mature young person. she was interviewed in the paternal home after school. x said that she had, recently, commenced high school which, she said, had been a good experience so far. (k) x said that she would prefer not to choose which home she lives in as it was a choice that might be “too difficult” to make. she said that it was difficult living across 2 homes in 2 different states. (l) x said that she got along well with the father and her step-mother but that she often argued with them both as well. she said: “there are more rules here than at mum’s”. (m) x said that she got along with all the members of the mother’s household and had a good relationship with the mother. about the maternal home, x said that it was sometimes “messy”, as alleged by the father, which she attributed to the mother having “2 babies under 3 (years)” which, she said, made it difficult to keep a home perfectly clean. x said that she was “a bit ocd” meaning that she liked her environment to be clean. she said, however, that she did not mind the mess made by her younger siblings and that she did not mind helping the mother clean up when she was there. (n) about the time in 2020 when she returned to sydney alone and y remained in city b, x said that she “cried for like a week” when that happened. x said that she missed y “a lot, like on a scale of one to ten, a hundred”. x said that her main worry was being separated from y. she said that she would be happy living in either home as long as it was with y. x said: “i don’t mind where i live. if she [y] doesn’t come back in the next year or so i’m going to have to go back up because i’m really struggling to stay down here, without her”. (o) x said that she wished the adults would “sort things out” and “stop fighting”. she said that, she believed, that the mother’s partner, “mr n” has now “been pulled into this” and that allegations have been made regarding “mr n”, possibly, “being on drugs” which, she said, could not be true. x said that “mr n” was “amazing” and she became quite distraught and teary, at this point. ms k sat with x for a few minutes at the end of the interview to give her time to regain her composure. x talked happily about her interests in music and arts and showed a beautiful piece that she was, currently, working on. (p) ms k stated the following in terms of her evaluation and made the following recommendations: (i) the parents remain entrenched in their respective positions and it would seem that there was no room for negotiability on either part as far as the parenting arrangements for x and y were concerned, which placed the children in a very difficult position. (ii) the parents’ proposals would see the children either separated from one parent during the school term or separated from each other for most of the time. (iii) serious concerns continued to be held about the children living apart and separated by a distance of, approximately, 2,000 kilometres (according to google maps). (iv) the primary issue for both x and y was their relationship with each other and they clearly missed each other more than either of the parents realised. (v) if the children continue to live separately there is a real risk of their relationship diminishing over time. this would be highly concerning given the importance of sibling relationships throughout the lifespan. further to this, there are 2 younger half-siblings in the maternal home, who must be considered in any future parenting arrangement. (vi) the children’s relationships with each parent are quite positive and have withstood the various separations and living arrangements over the years since the parents separated. having said that, it appears that x and y have each been separated from one parent or the other for some years now and both have likely experienced some sense of personal loss around this situation. both children have been navigating a difficult situation for a significant period of time now. (vii) given that their relationships with each parent would appear to be well-established, it may be that allowing the girls to prioritise their relationship with each other is the most appropriate course of action now. (viii) x seems to be open to living with either parent, while y wants to remain in city b. the 2 younger half-siblings may be one reason why y would prefer to remain in city b. if the parents continue to live a significant distance apart, the children would, ideally, both live primarily in either the maternal or paternal home and spend time with the other parent during school holidays. given the level of parental conflict as well as the geographical distance separating x and y, their relationship with each other may have become, particularly, important to them. (ix) if the parents continue to keep the children separated, the children’s relationships with each of them may also become at risk over time. (x) the poor co-parenting relationship would seem to be another emotional burden the children are, currently, dealing with. x, in particular, seemed distressed by this. x seemed to have identified a new development in the parenting dispute, that of possible allegations against the mother’s partner, “mr n”, which, she said, she found clearly upsetting. x’s comment about the maternal home being “messy” was a further indication of her heightened awareness of the parent’s dispute. both children seemed to have been exposed to sustained parental conflict over several years. if this paradigm continues, the relationships between the children and each parent are at risk of deteriorating over time. (xi) delaying a decision whereby the children live in one household was not in their best interests, as would be the case if the legal proceedings extended over a number of years. (xii) the children may benefit if the parents participate in post-separation parenting education programme. (xiii) it was difficult to envision how any further assessment would assist x and y, given their very clear expressions of their current thoughts and feelings. given that the children would appear to have very positive relationships with members of their family in both households, observations would likely simply reflect this view.   the mother said that the father had attempted to use the covid-19 pandemic issues to prevent y from returning to city b after spending time in the paternal home in the summer holidays. the mother said that y wanted to remain in city b with her. she said that, if y was to live permanently in nsw, she would be deprived of relationships with her younger siblings, u and ab who were, then, aged 3 years and 4 months, respectively. the mother said that x had told her that she wanted to remain living with the father in nsw for the time being because she wanted to “try out high school” in nsw before she made any decision about where she wanted to live. the mother said that both y and x were “used to” the current arrangements whereby they lived, separately, and spent time with each other during their school holidays.

(j) x, then aged 12 years, presented as a forthright and mature young person. she was interviewed in the paternal home after school. x said that she had, recently, commenced high school which, she said, had been a good experience so far. (k) x said that she would prefer not to choose which home she lives in as it was a choice that might be “too difficult” to make. she said that it was difficult living across 2 homes in 2 different states. (l) x said that she got along well with the father and her step-mother but that she often argued with them both as well. she said: “there are more rules here than at mum’s”. (m) x said that she got along with all the members of the mother’s household and had a good relationship with the mother. about the maternal home, x said that it was sometimes “messy”, as alleged by the father, which she attributed to the mother having “2 babies under 3 (years)” which, she said, made it difficult to keep a home perfectly clean. x said that she was “a bit ocd” meaning that she liked her environment to be clean. she said, however, that she did not mind the mess made by her younger siblings and that she did not mind helping the mother clean up when she was there. (n) about the time in 2020 when she returned to sydney alone and y remained in city b, x said that she “cried for like a week” when that happened. x said that she missed y “a lot, like on a scale of one to ten, a hundred”. x said that her main worry was being separated from y. she said that she would be happy living in either home as long as it was with y. x said: “i don’t mind where i live. if she [y] doesn’t come back in the next year or so i’m going to have to go back up because i’m really struggling to stay down here, without her”. (o) x said that she wished the adults would “sort things out” and “stop fighting”. she said that, she believed, that the mother’s partner, “mr n” has now “been pulled into this” and that allegations have been made regarding “mr n”, possibly, “being on drugs” which, she said, could not be true. x said that “mr n” was “amazing” and she became quite distraught and teary, at this point. ms k sat with x for a few minutes at the end of the interview to give her time to regain her composure. x talked happily about her interests in music and arts and showed a beautiful piece that she was, currently, working on. (p) ms k stated the following in terms of her evaluation and made the following recommendations: (i) the parents remain entrenched in their respective positions and it would seem that there was no room for negotiability on either part as far as the parenting arrangements for x and y were concerned, which placed the children in a very difficult position.

(p) ms k stated the following in terms of her evaluation and made the following recommendations: (i) the parents remain entrenched in their respective positions and it would seem that there was no room for negotiability on either part as far as the parenting arrangements for x and y were concerned, which placed the children in a very difficult position.

(b) the tenor of the children’s reported comments and their level of articulation and maturity strongly suggested that they had not been “coached” or unduly influenced in their views by either parent. (c) the mother’s move back to nsw to enable the children to be in closer proximity to the father was child focused, at the time. notwithstanding this, the mother confirmed that she had, nevertheless, found a residence which was a distance from the father’s residence which, she said, provided her with a sense of security and independence from him. (d) both children could possibly feel that they have been rejected by the mother ( although not “abandoned” by her) and have experienced anxiety, as a result. in particular, given that the mother moved to city b at a time when, on her evidence, the children’s change in living arrangements to the father’s home was being assessed as “experimental”, the mother then spent 10 days in the september 2019 school holiday period with the children but then did not see them for the christmas holiday period and noting the impact of covid-19, it was not until july 2020 when the children again had face-to-face time with her. this would have been very upsetting for them. (e) while there was the possibility of rejection, the impact of this on y was discounted given that y had only recorded positive things about the mother. (f) given x’s concerns about order, this might see her school work, detrimentally, affected, if she was living in the mother’s household and it was not maintained to her state of cleanliness and order. (g) considerable weight should be given to x’s views, given her age. (h) notwithstanding the positive outcomes for y in being able to complete her year 6 at primary school in 2022, the need to reunite the children was of greater importance.

primary considerations
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
in applying the considerations set out in the subsection (2), the court is to give greater weight to the consideration in paragraph 2(b). see s.60cc(2a) of the act.   approved the interpretation that a “meaningful relationship” is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child (citing mazorski v albright [2007] famca 520, per brown j and mccall v clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 per the full court), and (b) concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), and (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires the court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), and (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires the court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires the court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.

  being present when police or ambulance officers attend an incident involving the assault of a member of the child’s family by another member of the child’s family.   the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(a) of the act is supportive of the position that as much time as possible with both parents is in the children’s best interests. ms friedlander submitted, and the court accepts, that both children have meaningful relationships with each of their parents and had, until 2019, spent significant time with each of them, taking into account the distance between the parent’s 2 households and that the time which had been spent with the non-resident parent was, largely, limited to school holiday periods. since the parties’ final separation in march/april 2013, the children have, at various times, lived with the mother and the father and spent school holidays with each of them, which has been the basis for the creation of their meaningful relationships. in that regard, ms friedlander submitted that the independent children lawyer’s proposal was one with which the children would be familiar with, albeit different to the pre-2017 situation, and would, accordingly, not impede the mother having a continuing and loving relationship with them, as the father did when the children had lived, primarily, with her. the court accepts the independent children’s lawyers submission, in that regard and weight is attached to it. (b) the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(b) of the act is, largely, inapplicable on the facts of this case. neither the mother nor the father in their proposals suggested that the children were in need of specific protection from anything. the independent children’s lawyer submitted that there was no evidence that the children have suffered any physical harm. the court, however, notes ms friedlander’s submission that the children may have suffered some psychological harm as a result of the mother’s decision to alter the parenting arrangements in 2019 so that the father became the children’s primary care parent, noting, particularly, ms k’s findings that both children “have likely experienced some sense of personal loss around this situation”. the court accepts the independent children’s lawyer’s submission that it is vital that the mother is seen to encourage and support y in moving back to the father’s care and that, equally, the father acts so as to be understanding and sympathetic to her feelings of mixed emotions and that both children should, on no account, fail to see the mother on their school holidays and that the mother should be encouraged to communicate with the children on a frequent basis. the court accepts that the independent children’s lawyers proposal would permit this to occur and weight is attached to that.   the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(b) of the act is, largely, inapplicable on the facts of this case. neither the mother nor the father in their proposals suggested that the children were in need of specific protection from anything. the independent children’s lawyer submitted that there was no evidence that the children have suffered any physical harm. the court, however, notes ms friedlander’s submission that the children may have suffered some psychological harm as a result of the mother’s decision to alter the parenting arrangements in 2019 so that the father became the children’s primary care parent, noting, particularly, ms k’s findings that both children “have likely experienced some sense of personal loss around this situation”. the court accepts the independent children’s lawyer’s submission that it is vital that the mother is seen to encourage and support y in moving back to the father’s care and that, equally, the father acts so as to be understanding and sympathetic to her feelings of mixed emotions and that both children should, on no account, fail to see the mother on their school holidays and that the mother should be encouraged to communicate with the children on a frequent basis. the court accepts that the independent children’s lawyers proposal would permit this to occur and weight is attached to that.
additional considerations any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child's views,
“there are many factors that may go to the weight that should be given to the wishes of the children and these will vary from case to case and it is undesirable and indeed impossible to catalogue or confine them in the manner suggested. ultimately it is a process of intuitive syntheses on the part of any trial judge weighing up all the evidence relevant to the wishes of the children and applying it in a common sense way as one of the factors in the overall assessment of the children’s best interests".   the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child's parents,  ) and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:  to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  ) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  i) to communicate with the child,   the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child, the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from: (i) either of his or her parents,   or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living, the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, the capacity of: (i) each of the child's parents, to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs ) any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs, the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child's parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant.  if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child: (i) the child's right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and (ii) the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right,  the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family,  if a family violence order applies, or has applied, (be it final, interim, contested or consented to) to the child or a member of the child’s family-any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:(i) the nature of the order,(ii) the circumstances in which the order was made,(iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order,(iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order,(v) any other relevant matter, whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
