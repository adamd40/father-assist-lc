ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
the parties’ dysfunctional on and off relationship appears to have continued post-separation in as much as communication between them remains poor or non-existent which appears to have resulted in important care regimes for x such as night toilet training not being consistent or successfully implemented across the two households which must be confusing for x. reports of x’s reluctance to separate from the mother on alternate tuesday when he knows he will not be seeing his mother for six days, if true, raise concerns about the suitability of the current arrangements in the context of the ineffectual communications between the parties and the father’s solely negative view of the mother.[6]
unless both parties shift from their polarised view of each other and become genuinely committed to mutually supporting, fostering and facilitating x’s relationship with the other, which will require improved communication between them focusing on ensuring consistent care routines across the households including night time toileting practices, then x’s current transitional distress may well develop into maladaptive behaviours that can only be viewed as detrimental to his emotional wellbeing in the long term.[10]
at about 8.30 pm on 21 march 2022 x made allegations of abuse by the father. i was speaking to x about having to return to his father when he became noticeably agitated. x said, “no. i don’t want to go there and you can’t make me.” i kept insisting that he would have to go as it was his turn to spend time with daddy. x replied, “well..... if i do there are things that have to change, four things that have to change.” x, unprompted, said that, “daddy can’t grab me around the neck”, paused, and then said, “because it hurts.” i did ask x if he thought his dad was just joking or messing around to which he said, “no.” he told me that it happens when daddy gets angry with him. x had previously on occasions been reluctant to return to his father but this was the first time he had raised issues of violence. x also mentioned that his daddy sends him to his room when he is just bouncing or playing. he gets angry and then has to spend time in his room. over the next few days x repeated that the father had been violent to him and that happened “a lot” and that “its bad there”. he has repeated this in front of the maternal grandmother when she mentioned about going back to daddy’s, being unaware of what i had been told by x.[12]
the legal principles applicable
is there unacceptable risk? this requires an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk arising and whether with or without safeguards it is acceptable.[13]
