reasons for judgmentrevised from transcript
judge burchardt
the court may make a decree for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceedings if:   the first party is defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings, and (b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.   the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.
for the purposes of this section, a defence or proceedings or part of proceedings need not be:   hopeless, or (b) bound to fail,   bound to fail,
to have no reasonable prospect of success.
the exercise of powers to summarily terminate proceedings must always be attended with caution.
section 31a(2) requires a practical judgment by the federal court as to whether the applicant has more than a “fanciful” prospect of success.
first, the central idea about which the provisions pivot is “no reasonable prospect” (emphasis added). the choice of the word “reasonable” is important. if s 31a is to be seen as deriving from r 24.2 of the civil procedure rules 1998 of england and wales, its provisions underwent an important change in the course of their translation from that jurisdiction to this. the english rule speaks of “no real prospect”, section 31a speaks of “no reasonable prospect”. the two phrases convey very different meanings. second, effect must be given to the negative admonition in sub-s (3) that a defence, a proceeding, or a part of a proceeding may be found to have no reasonable prospect of successful prosecution even if it cannot be said that it is “hopeless” or “bound to fail”. it will be necessary to examine further the notion of “no reasonable prospect”. but before undertaking that task, it is important to begin by recognising that the combined effect of sub-ss (2) and (3) is that the inquiry required in this case is whether there is a “reasonable” prospect of prosecuting the proceeding, not an enquiry directed to whether a certain and concluded determination could be made that the proceeding would necessarily fail.
how then should the expression “no reasonable prospect” be understood? no paraphrase of the expression can be adopted as a sufficient explanation of its operation, let alone definition of its content. nor can the expression usefully be understood by the creation of some antinomy intended to capture most or all of the cases in which it cannot be said that there is “no reasonable prospect”. the judicial creation of a lexicon of words or phrases intended to capture the operation of a particular statutory phrase like “no reasonable prospect” is to be avoided. consideration of the difficulties that bedevilled the proviso to common form criminal appeal statutes, as a result of judicial glossing of the relevant statutory expression, provides the clearest example of the dangers that attend any such attempt. in many cases where a plaintiff has no reasonable prospect of prosecuting a proceeding, the proceeding could be described (with or without the addition of intensifying epithets like “clearly”, “manifestly” or “obviously”) as “frivolous”, “untenable”, “groundless” or “faulty”. but none of those expressions (alone or in combination) should be understood as providing a sufficient chart of the metes and bounds of the power given by section 31a. nor can the content of the word “reasonable”, in the phrase “no reasonable prospect”, be sufficiently, let alone completely, illuminated by drawing some contrast with what would be a “frivolous”, “untenable”, “groundless” or “faulty” claim. rather, full weight must be given to the expression as a whole.
i now come to a final, sixth principle, which is that in determining whether a real issue of fact exists such as to preclude summary judgment, the court must draw all reasonable inferences - but only reasonable inferences - in favour of the non-moving party. i emphasise “reasonable” because it is on this point that the lowering of the bar effected by s 31a becomes clear. by distinguishing between “hopeless” cases and those without reasonable prospects for success, the statute makes clear that the court need not (indeed, must not) refuse summary judgment on the basis of a factual dispute said to arise only from a plausible, as opposed to a reasonable, inference.
x stated that he would like to see his mother and his sister y. he appeared excited at this prospect. x raised no concerns about his care with either parent. no other information was gathered as x became distracted.
child protection received a report regarding y on 21/01/2022. following an investigation of the protective concerns, child protection identified that y is safe to continue to reside with her mother and maternal grandmother, ms f. the family advised that ms spencer spends a few nights a week in the home with y and ms f and the rest of the week with her partner. child protection developed a safety plan with the family that y remains with ms f whilst ms spencer spends the night with her current partner. ms f was assessed as a safe person for y and suitable to care for her when ms spencer is not present at the home.
