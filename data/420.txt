background facts   in 1960, the father was born in the city k area of sydney and he is, currently, 62 years of age. he moved to sydney at the age of 6 years and was the eldest of 3 children, with a brother 2 years younger than him and a sister 3 years younger than him. (b) in 1975, the mother was born and she is, currently, 47 years of age. (c) in or around 2002, the parties met and they, subsequently, commenced a relationship in 2004. (d) in or around 2006, the parties commenced cohabitation at the father’s home, acquired by him prior to their relationship and situated at l street, suburb m (“the l street, suburb m property”). the parties did not marry. (e) in 2006, the first child of the parties’ relationship, x, was born and she is, currently, 15 years of age. (f) in 2009, the second child of the parties’ relationship, y, was born and he is, currently, 12 years of age. (g) between april 2012 and august 2013, the parties separated under the same roof and shared the care of the children. (h) in july 2013, the mother said that she had found and viewed a video which she believed had been created by the father in 2006 of a woman masturbating in a bathroom. she handed this video, together with other videos belonging to the father, to the police. the police, subsequently, reported that they had seen no images of children in the videos and informed her that they were going to destroy them. the father confirmed that the videos (dvds) found in his home related to his previous partner “ms n”. he confirmed that the police had never contacted him about these videos and maintained that the mother had been going through his possessions to find things. the court notes that the father, in his oral evidence, said that the mother had gone to the police about these issues to create trouble for him. the mother responded that she had reported those matters to the police to have them “put them on file”. the mother agreed that the father was not a risk to the children. (i) on 30 april 2013, orders were made, by consent, in terms of the parties’ property dispute whereby, inter alia, the mother received by monetary instalments, the sum of $265,000.00 and the father retained all of his right, title and interest in the l street, suburb m property, acquired by him prior to the commencement of the parties’ relationship. (j) in or around june 2013 (on the mother’s evidence) or august 2013 (on the father’s evidence), the parties physically separated, with the mother moving out of the l street, suburb m property into a rented apartment in suburb o, nsw. (k) between august 2013 and november 2018, the children lived with the mother and spent time with the father which implemented an arrangement for overnight time with him every thursday and from saturday morning to monday, being 6 nights per fortnight and half of all school holiday periods. (l) between 2013 and 2019, the mother asserted that she allowed for additional block time for the children to spend time with the father during the holiday periods for 2 to 3 weeks and additional telephone communication. the mother maintained that the father did not offer her any flexibility with respect to the christmas or boxing day spend-time arrangements with the children. (m) in 2015, the mother met mr j online and commenced a relationship with him. they commenced cohabitation in or around 2015. mr j grew up in city p in the country q, then moved to australia when he was 38 years of age. he has 2 young adult daughters, aged, approximately, 26 and 24 years, one of whom works as a health care worker and the other as a public servant, in the country q. he maintains some connection with them. mr j works in the technology sector. (n) in or around may 2018, the mother asserted that the children had become reluctant to spend time with the father every weekend. the mother, further, asserted that she had observed x becoming argumentative and disrespectful in her interactions with the father. (o) in or around november 2018, the father asserted that y had stopped responding to his sms messages when he was in the mother’s care. he, further, asserted that the mother had commenced referring to the children as “my kids” and said words to him to the effect of: “i’ll decide when and if you get to see them [the children]”. (p) on 5 november 2018, the father asserted that the mother had requested school information from him and, following a changeover, she had accused him of failing to provide the requested information. (q) on 8 november 2018, the mother attended the father’s residence to collect some clothing and an argument occurred between them. the father alleged that the mother had pushed him over, grazing his knees and the mother alleged that the father had grabbed and pushed her (“the november 2018 incident”). the children were in the mother’s car at the time of this incident. the mother, subsequently, sent an sms message to the father saying: “you’ve thrown my right side neck and arm out by grabbing me and pushing me this morning. you truly are a coward. how proud you must be of yourself and i can see that’s why you are still alone because you are a fucking coward asshole. big man you are”. the father attended upon the police and made a report. police video footage supported his attendance but no statement was taken and no record made, at the time. (r) on 10 november 2018, the mother asserted that she had attended upon the police at the suburb o station and reported the incident, as referred to in (q), above and gave her version of the events in a statement supplied. as no other version had been recorded, the mother was listed as the victim. the father was, subsequently, arrested at, approximately, 10.30pm. after arresting the father and confirming he was the first complainant, viewing his injury and determining his version, police were of the opinion that he was the person in need of protection. the mother agreed that in her police statement she had made no reference to the father pushing her. see exhibit “d”. (s) on 12 november 2018, an apprehended domestic violence order (“advo”) was taken out by the police against the mother for the protection of the father with respect to the november 2018 incident. the mother was served with the advo in person at her home and was advised to appear at the local court of nsw at suburb f on 19 november 2018. the mother maintained that since she had been served with the advo she was then reluctant to receive or make calls to the father due to concerns about the potential for allegations to be made against her. (t) after 12 november 2018, the father asserted that the mother had, unilaterally, reduced the children’s time with him from 6 nights to 4 nights per fortnight. (u) on 20 november 2018, the mother attended the local court of nsw at suburb f in relation to the advo proceedings. those proceedings were then adjourned to 8 january 2019 and, subsequently, to 4 february 2019 and then interim orders were put in place until 5 august 2019. (v) between november 2018 and 10 february 2019, the mother asserted that both children had continued spending time with the father with y continuing to spend time with him each thursday night and each alternate weekend from saturday until the commencement of school on monday and with x, thereafter, ceasing time with him. (w) on 24 december 2018, the father asserted that he had sent an sms message to the mother which stated: “what time for the kids tomorrow?” to which the mother replied: “it’s a happy family day here tomorrow. you can collect them on your thursday. maybe you should have thought through the consequences before you lied to the police”. (x) on 25 december 2018, the father asserted that he had attempted to contact the mother and had called her 7 times and sent her an sms message but had received no response. he maintained that the children did not spend christmas day with him and did not speak with him, contrary to the usual arrangements. the mother, however, asserted that she had encouraged x to respond to the father’s calls and maintained that she did not restrict any contact between x and the father. (y) on 27 december 2018, the children had dinner with the father and their paternal grandparents. (z) in or around january/february 2019, the father asserted that he had asked x if she had wanted to stay with him overnight and x had replied: “no. it’s my option whether i stay”. x was, thereafter, unresponsive to the father’s telephone calls and sms messages. she sent sms messages to the father saying: “i’m staying at mum’s on thursday and the weekend. optionally.”, and then, “mum didn’t make us stay with her. we wanted to stay”. (aa) on 10 february 2019, the paternal aunt, ms e, asserted that she had spent time with x for the last time as a family and x had then left that visit without saying “goodbye”. (bb) on 21 february 2019, x spent an overnight time in the father’s care. the father asserted that, in the morning, she had packed all of her things in a rushed, unusual way. this was the last time that x spent any overnight time with the father or was in his care at all. (cc) in late february 2019, y began spending between 3 to 4 nights a fortnight with the father, being thursday nights and from saturday to monday each alternate week. the father asserted that the mother had not agreed to y staying with him for more than 4 or 5 days during the school holiday periods. (dd) on 8 march 2019, the father asserted that he had found y’s school shirt with the mother’s handwriting in permanent black marker on it saying: “my weekend clothes because mr belair steals and lies” (“the shirt incident”). y said to the father: “mum wrote it and made me wear it. (ee) on 29 march 2019, the father commenced these proceedings. (ff) on 5 august 2019, the advo, as referred to in (u), above, lapsed and was dismissed. (gg) on 8 august 2019, the mother said to the father in front of y and his friend, at school: “you’re a coward. you are going to lose y as well”. (hh) on 5 september 2019, interim parenting orders were made, by consent, confirming the parenting arrangements which then commenced from late february 2019, as referred to in paragraph 4, above. (ii) on 31 january 2020, orders were made for y to spend time with the father during the school holidays and further orders were made, by consent, for the family to attend family therapy with ms r (“ms r”) at the c counsellors. (jj) on 28 february 2020, 16 april 2020 and 5 june 2020, x attended on ms r at the c counsellors. (kk) on 3 august 2020, ms r prepared a report in relation to family therapy. (ll) on 13 november 2020, the father filed an application in a case, as amended on 17 november 2020, which sought orders with respect to his time during the christmas holiday periods. (mm) on 15 december 2020, orders were made, by consent, for y to spend a period of 11 nights and then 4 nights with the father during the christmas period. (nn) on 25 december 2020, y said to the father: “i got 3 video games. i stayed up until 4.00am ... watching videos. you might be unhappy about that...i slept from about 4.00am until 7.00am and then opened my presents and then went back to bed. i got up at about midday... i haven’t eaten anything today”. (oo) on 31 december 2020 (after midnight), y burst into tears when the father told him he had to go to bed. (pp) on 1 january 2020, y slept for most of the day and, upon waking, he said to the father: “drop me off at mum’s at 4 o’clock”. y cried on the way home to the mother’s house and did not say “goodbye” to the father. the mother sent the father an sms message which said: “after you dropped [y] home he has been extremely upset and he does not want to go back. maybe an apology to him might work to smooth things???” to which the father replied: “y didn’t like me trying to get him to bed at a reasonable hour.... i would appreciate your support in adhering to the consent orders...”. the mother then replied with the following: “...[y] came back in tears and you returned him going against the orders. he is still upset with you. a simple apology never hurt anyone. i am sorry you have that problem. he goes to bed when he is asked at home........ as far as picking up [y] pls work that out with [y] as you clearly decided to drop him back early. at this point [y] is still upset with you again, you should try to apologise and work out the issues so he wants to go back to you.” (qq) on 2 january 2021, the mother sent an sms message to the father which said: “i asked [y] to pick up your call or respond (sic) to any msg last night (sic). he slept well and he is back to his happy self”, and “don’t appreciated (sic) the rambling about court orders when you decided to return [y] early for me to resolve your issues with him. also note court orders state that we will respect their wishes...” (rr) between 2 january 2021 and 14 january 2021, the father attempted to contact y but received no reply. (ss) on 8 january 2021, the single expert report of dr d was released to the parties. (tt) on 15 january 2021, y spent time with the father at the paternal grandparents’ home in accordance with arrangements made between the father and the mother’s lawyers. (uu) on 20 january 2021, the father sent an sms message to the mother which stated: “ms warnica i am still available tomorrow. how’s [y]?” the mother replied: “[y] is happy. [y] is well aware that he has to see you tomorrow. why don’t you txt him saying how excited you are to spend time with him so when he returns home i don’t have to clean up the emotional mess again”. (vv) on 21 january 2021, the father contacted y at 9.45am and at 1.26pm y replied to the father indicating that he had just woken up and to collect him at 2.00pm. (ww) on 22 january 2021, the father’s lawyers wrote to the mother’s lawyers seeking to implement the recommendations of dr d. that letter noted as follows: “... y is sleeping until the late afternoon, after playing video games late into the night. we are instructed that y could not be collected until 1.30pm yesterday because he was asleep until around that time. it would be more beneficial to y’s relationships if he were able to engage in other activities, including with our client, during the daytime”. the father proposed that y’s bedtime be agreed upon and enforced in both households, changeover to occur at school, x to commence therapy with ms r and for y to receive medical attention for his gait issues. (xx) on 26 january 2021, y, accidentally, caught the father’s toes under his bedroom door and the father reacted by pushing the door away. after this event, y said to the father that he wished to return home and the father then returned y to the mother’s home. (yy) on 4 february 2021, y said to the father: “i know about the bedtimes and i know about the video games”. when y arrived at the father’s home he locked himself in the room, broke a toy, called the father’s dogs “rats” and then ran home to the mother’s house. (zz) on 6 february 2021, y spent time with the paternal grandparents, ms e, and the father. he said to the father: “you can’t even get a job”.   in 1975, the mother was born and she is, currently, 47 years of age. (c) in or around 2002, the parties met and they, subsequently, commenced a relationship in 2004. (d) in or around 2006, the parties commenced cohabitation at the father’s home, acquired by him prior to their relationship and situated at l street, suburb m (“the l street, suburb m property”). the parties did not marry. (e) in 2006, the first child of the parties’ relationship, x, was born and she is, currently, 15 years of age. (f) in 2009, the second child of the parties’ relationship, y, was born and he is, currently, 12 years of age. (g) between april 2012 and august 2013, the parties separated under the same roof and shared the care of the children.

(vv) on 21 january 2021, the father contacted y at 9.45am and at 1.26pm y replied to the father indicating that he had just woken up and to collect him at 2.00pm.

expert evidence
parental responsibility
major long-term issues, in relation to a child, means issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about: (a) the child’s education (both current and future), and (b) the child’s religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child’s health, and (d) the child’s name, and (e) changes to the child’s living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent. to avoid doubt, a decision by a parent of a child to form a relationship with a new partner is not, of itself, a major long‑term issue in relation to the child. however, the decision will involve a major long‑term issue if, for example, the relationship with the new partner involves the parent moving to another area and the move will make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with the other parent. [original emphasis]
primary considerations
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.

  being present when police or ambulance officers attend an incident involving the assault of a member of the child’s family by another member of the child’s family.   the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(a) of the act is supportive of the position that y should spend the majority of his fortnightly school term time with the father so as to ensure that his relationship with the father is not further damaged by his experience of a loyalty divide in the mother’s household and so as to provide him with the potential to value his past experience of the good times with the father and not to view those within a context that requires him to reject them. (ii) the primary consideration referred to in s 60cc (2)(a) of the act is supportive of there being an order that x live with the mother and spend time with the father in accordance with her wishes. that gives her the potential, as a “free” agent, given her age, to seek to repair any relationship with the father as part of the family therapy as agreed upon between her parents. (iii) the court accepts that both children view the mother as their primary care parent. however, both children have adopted a protective attitude to her which has supported her negative views of the father and, indeed, an adoption by them of those negative views, in circumstances where, in the case of x, only family therapy has the potential to change that position. however, in the case of y, majority time orders, as opined by dr d, have the potential to assist y in disengaging the negative views of the mother from his own, noting that he had experienced positive views of the father in the past, which he was and is suppressing. (iv) the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(b) of the act is, largely, inapplicable, given that the orders sought by the parties do not contemplate supervision and otherwise provide for reasonable time to be spent to the effect that the competing proposals do not suggest that y is in need of protection from anything. further, the parties have agreed to various restraints which provide further protection for the children, in this regard.  ) the primary consideration referred to in s 60cc (2)(a) of the act is supportive of there being an order that x live with the mother and spend time with the father in accordance with her wishes. that gives her the potential, as a “free” agent, given her age, to seek to repair any relationship with the father as part of the family therapy as agreed upon between her parents.
