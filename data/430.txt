the period between the april mention and the july interim hearing
in circumstances where parenting orders were made today on a fresh application and in light of recent events and circumstances, chambers would be assisted by the parties advising whether they still require judgment and reasons to be delivered in relation to the interim hearing that occurred on 25 november 2019.
it is our view that the agreed orders and decision made on friday, 3 april 2020 concerning our client's application in a case filed 27 march 2020 and the pending family report to be undertaken, makes the decision on exclusive occupation nugatory. if his honour were to deliver judgement now in relation to the interim hearing that occurred on 25 november 2019, it would result in confusion and destabilising this family.
chambers notes the reply from the applicant's solicitors. could the respondent's solicitors please indicate if they hold instructions on this matter. i note that chambers does not seek a consent position of the parties in this particular matter and is merely seeking the parties' views.
i am instructed to request that the orders and reasons for judgment of the interim hearing conducted on the urgent applications of both the applicant and respondent in november 2019 be delivered.

the hearing
the relationship
the issue the parties consider not in the matter in consequence of the orders sought- risk of abuse, neglect or exposure to family violence
preliminary issues at the commencement of the hearing
the evidence  melounis] laid the blame for these incidents squarely at [ms melounis'] feet, and the report writer is of the view that it is likely that [ms melounis] did behave in ways that would have caused the children emotional harm. the responsibility for her choices in these situations rests solely with [ms melounis] and - based on her narrative and what she has deposed - it appears that her insight into the harm her actions wrought on the children through 2019 is minimal. she is currently much more focused on the harm she believes has been done to the children by [mr melounis] insisting that they are not safe to live with her, when she was previously their primary carer.
the report writer is also troubled, though, by the way in which [mr melounis] has presented himself as the victim and as the loving and concerned father, when an analysis of his behaviours, both pre and post separation, suggests that his motives may not be as pure as he suggests. the behaviours that are particularly concerning are the extent to which [mr melounis] used the police to resolve the couple's disputes, without regard for the impact of this on the children, the way he constantly filmed mr [sic] [melounis], knowing that this was a trigger for her rage (noting that this does not absolve [ms melounis] of blame for how she responded, but that it remains evidence of a somewhat calculated approach on [mr melounis'] part (which again was more than likely to impact on the children), and what appears to be his pattern of shutting down arguments by walking away, which included being non responsive to [ms melounis] for extended periods of time.
there are a number of concerns outline by [the court expert] that have caused me to reflect and acknowledge the role that i have played with the children being exposed to the conflict of [mr melounis] and i. i acknowledge that the relationship of [mr melounis] and i was a toxic one, and the children were exposed to the conflict between us...i did not react well to the situation that was developing with [mr melounis]...[ms h] indicated some concern that i lacked insight as to my behaviour in 2019. i am surprised by that conclusion, in circumstances where i had thought that i had made clear that my behaviour, from time to time, was disgusting.
as a precautionary measure, i would get my mobile out to film as i was worried [ms melounis] would make up allegations of violence against me. whenever [ms melounis] saw that i am filming her on my mobile, her aggression will escalate, and she would start to scream words to the following effect: "turn off that fucking camera!" and, "don't film me, you fucking bastard". she will also try to grab my phone. i have video evidence of this. with the benefit of hindsight, i admit that my filming of [ms melounis] and her filming of me was at times unnecessary and increased the conflict between us rather than stop it. i regret that we were unable to resolve our differences. [ms melounis] has continued to record myself and my family on several occasions post-separation in the presence of the children. she has been asked to stop in writing after every occasion.
mr wong: turn to page 203 of your affidavit? yes. you refer to regret and so forth. when did you start to record the mother in 2019? father: in about march 2019. the wife and i recorded each other. mr wong: the wife asked you in march 2019 to stop recording her? father: we had an agreement in april to film each other. mr wong: the wife asked you to stop filming her? father: on occasions, yes. mr wong: you didn't listen to her? father: no. mr wong: rather than de-escalate the situation, and as you say at paragraph 203, your filming increased the conflict? father: yes, on occasions. yes. mr wong: how do you think the wife felt being filmed when she had asked you not to? father: she did not feel good. i did not feel good.
omg i love it!!!!!!! my beautiful boy [smiley face emoji with heart eyes].
which prompted the following exchange with the father.
father: not urs, [ms melounis’], pls stop staying that. mother: [mr melounis], that's normal language and it doesn't mean that. c'mon, please, [mr melounis]. everyone says that. why do u do this every day to me? i just try and get through the day. stop hating me. father: hoping if u stop saying it u will stop believing it. mother: stop saying what i believe. why can't u leave me alone? father: [ms melounis], all i am asking it to stop referring to the kids being urs and not ours. mother: u r being ridiculous and just putting me down for the sake of it. it's just what people say. stop it. stop it, pleeease. i can't take it. father: [ms melounis], i am not putting u done. asking u to stop referring to the kids as being urs.
mr wong: if you could turn to your affidavit to page 16, paragraph 86. your trial affidavit father: yes. mr wong: alright, now sir paragraph 86 on page 16 refers to an incident on 30 march 2019 and this was an occasion where you had taken x to a [sports] school, and that was on the saturday morning. now, you say at paragraph 86 whilst at [sports] school [ms melounis] and i had an argument through text messages. those text messages aren’t annexed but can i assist you by having regard to the...i’ll pull it out for you, even better. just give the witness this bundle. your honour doesn’t have this but i’ll tender it in due course. father: thanks. mr wong: this is the 30 march 9:46am. father: yes. mr wong: and at page 17 you can see that there is an image of children. any of your children in that image? father: yes [y], using the same ipad... mr wong: [y’s] tutorials. if you go to page 18, there’s an image of a child about to go for a nice swim. father: yeah x. mr wong: x. it is a video of x swimming at the [sports] school. father: yep. mr wong: the video of yo9ur son doing something pretty cool, you send to your wife. this happens at around 9:46am according to this doc on page 17 this video is sent at about that time. it’s a case that where you say at paragraph 86, and i make no criticism of you. you hadn’t got home at 9:45am to speak to [ms melounis] because you were just sending the image, i don’t make any criticism of that just so you’re not confused. father: that’s fine. mr wong: so you send this video and your wife’s writing is in the darker colour on page 19. she says omg i love it!!! multiple exclamation marks. that’s in response to seeing the video and images you sent to her at about 9:46am. she goes “my beautiful boy” and uses an emoji with love heart eyes. that’s a pretty lovely thing for a mother to say about her boy. you response is this, “not yours [ms melounis], please stop saying that”. i can suggest to you that the mother made a totally innocuo9us and loving comment about her son. father: yes, if there was no history absolutely. mr wong: she says to you this, “[mr melounis] that’s normal language and it doesn’t mean that. come one, please [mr melounis]. everyone says that.” father: yes. mr wong: she’s trying to rationalise with you. father: yes. mr wong: and she says, “why do you do this everyday to me, i just try and get through the day. stop hating me”. can you see that? father: yes. mr wong: sir i suggest to you that this was a perfectly pleasant exchange that you threw the hand grenade into by the words “not yours [ms melounis], stop saying that”. father: yes, that was a conflict text message. mr wong: yes it was. what you don’t say at paragraph 86 of your affidavit, is that in fact when you look back at those text messages you’re the one kicking it off. father: if you’re just looking at that very small step, yes. the conflict i was having with [ms melounis] was that she felt – or felt, i’ll use the past tense - that she owned these children. so i thought if i start correcting the language that these are our children, that may help. so i started even in silly text messages like this saying these are our children. our children, not mine - our children. i agree in a simplistic normal relationship that’s nothing. but that was the concept behind that. mr wong: you said you’d, “stop saying it if you stopped believing it”. and she said “stop saying what i believe. why can’t you leave me alone?” and i’ll suggest to your sir that in or around the 30 march 2019, you’d been hectoring her about her language hadn’t you? you’d been hectoring her, criticising her day in day out. father: no, i know it’s very hard to believe. but essentially this is the conflict, this on the day. it’s about this silly text message, “not yours [ms melounis]” and it shows how volatile the relationship was. mr wong: how volatile what was? father: the relationship. mr wong: you take no responsibility for that at paragraph 86 do you? father: no, i guess. no, i should’ve. and as i said that was the concept behind it. try to correct the language which will hopefully help the mindset. mr wong: this is about being responsible for your own conduct. that’s what you want [ms melounis] to be right? right. you’ve got to be responsible for your own as well. that was an appalling way of responding to a very innocuous message wasn’t it? father: as i said, the concept was that i’m trying to correct the mentality that these are both our children and it’s as simple as a silly text message blown out of proportion. mr wong: i suggest to you sir that your wife is saying, she is telling you this is normal language. she’s impressing upon you that she’s not meaning anything by it, you can see that in her exchange with you. father: yes. mr wong but you just won’t accept it would you? father: it’s the same concept. i was trying to reflect the language that these are both our children. it’s a simple text message, i was hopeful that you know what, let’s just start talking about our children, our children, our children and that will have an impact. mr wong: this is a moment when you’re still together as a couple. on either parties assessment. and she says “stop hating me” right. that’s how she felt you were putting her down. father: yes. mr wong: but you didn’t stop did you, you kept on going. okay. she asked you to leave her alone but you kept on going. father: sorry, where does it say that sorry? mr wong: paragraph 20, “why can’t you leave me alone”. page 20. father: as i write in there, “[ms melounis], i am asking you to stop referring to the kids being yours and not ours”. as i say, i talk about the children as ours and i understand it creates conflict but let’s just do that and just see how that works. mr wong: she’s given you a stop sign, saying “stop hating me” because that’s how she felt when you engaged that first time. you go past that. “stop saying what i believe, why can’t you leave me alone”. again, stop sign. go past that. right. and she goes “you’re being ridiculous just putting me down for the sake of it”. that’s how she’s seeing it. alright. “it’s just what people say, stop it stop, please i can’t take it.” go past that. “[ms melounis] i’m not putting you down, i’m asking you to stop referring to the kids as yours.” father: yes. “[ms melounis], i’m not putting you down”. as in the purpose of this text message is not to put you down it’s about referring to the children as ours, that’s what i was trying to put down. as i said that’s consistent with what i’m saying. mr wong: right. she says “i have to go to [city aj] today after you called all my family the other week and you want to keep sticking it to me. what do you want from me, why can’t you leave me in peace?” again she’s saying “leave me go, leave me alone”. again, go past that stop sign. “shall i get them some food on the way back?”.“ [ms melounis], you just can’t do what you like in a relationship”. right. all she has done is said “omg i love it! my beautiful boy”. why didn’t you just leave her alone? father: as i said i was using that language for that purpose. and i mean, stepping back... mr wong: you go to... his honour: stepping back? you said? father: stepping back, this conflict between text messages should not have resulted in this 30 march outcome. it’s just, yes i understand i am creating the conflict in this text message. i’ve presented why i’m doing it. and yes, it just shows the volatility of the relationship that this text messaging back and forth has resulted in this event on 30 march. mr wong: and you say “you can’t just do what you like in a relationship” so you’re referring to her chosen words “my beautiful boy”. that’s what you’re referring to there, ‘can’t do that’, ‘i don’t like those words’. that’s what you’re saying, right. yes? father: i’m saying we both should be referring to the children as ours, because it was a problem in our relationship that these are “my children, my children, my children”. and as stupid as correcting this on the text message, stepping back, looking at this it is ridiculous that we’re doing this, but i’m just going, let’s just start correcting our language to “ours”. mr wong: when you’re saying we’re doing this... father: as in we’re in this conflict. mr wong: you’re doing this. father: okay, well i started the conflict. okay. mr wong: you say this, “so if you want peace”... fahter: what page are we on? mr wong: page 21, third paragraph down. “[ms melounis], you can’t just do what you like in a relationship. so if you want peace then it will only come from separating. otherwise we need to be couple and do things we agree on.” and what you’re talking about her agreeing on is bucking to the way you want her to speak about the children. father: no it’s consistent with what i’m saying. it’s about the children being ours. mr wong: and you didn’t like her language and you were going to start a fight about it, that’s what you decided to do. right. father: no... mr maurice: the witness was just answering. mr wong: sorry, you are quite right. i was too excited. father: the purpose wasn’t to create conflict, the purpose was to change the mentality because that has been the struggle in our relationship from a very long period of time and i thought that correcting it and sticking to it as you said, and pushing it through as let’s refer to these children as ours. as stupid and conflict-driven it appears in this text message, that was my thought. it wasn’t to create conflict, it wasn’t to upset [ms melounis]. it was to start talking about these kids as ours. i’m happy to do that, as in i’ll call them ours. i’ll refer to the children as ours as well. as you said when someone says ‘my kids’, ‘my this’ it’s an innocent comment - no one thinks anything of it. in the context of our relationship it was a big deal, because it was something i was trying to correct in our relationship. to go, ‘these are our children’. mr wong: but you’re trying to correct it in a way that your wife is absolutely getting distressed in these text messages. father: yes she got very upset, absolutely. mr wong: so when is enough enough? so that you just leave that and go and do something else? because you’re causing her emotional distress. father: over yours or ours in a text message. mr wong: yeah, is that worth it? father: it was worth it if...as i said, that’s what i was trying to achieve. mr wong: it was worth it if you could achieve what you wanted. father: that we would view these children as ours. that’s right. it was worth the conflict on that day. it’s very silly i know, looking at it.
i called the police and an apprehended violence order was put on [ms melounis] for the protection of me, the children and anyone with whom i have a domestic relationship. ... [paragraph 159] [ms melounis] changed her plea from not guilty to guilty after i had provided video evidence of the incident to the police on 23 september 2019.
sorry, [ms melounis]. i swear i told them i wouldn't press charges but they said they would either way. i will pick you up and hope we can through this. i haven't told anyone.   ba] [appearing for the mother] tells me that the phone was not, in fact, broken. it seems to be rather a blurry area in that she has obviously agreed to the facts, the elements of the offence. she has attempted to grab the phone. however, it appears the victim was filming her at the time, which i do not doubt was extremely aggravating in the circumstances. as i say, this all arises on the back of obviously the breakdown of a marriage where people behave in ways that are often completely out of character. in the circumstances, i consider the offence to be significantly trivial and i do not intend to impose a conviction. indeed, i intend to dismiss the matter pursuant to section 10(1)(a).
i accept what you say, sergeant, that the avos are mandatory where there is a finding of guilt. i will grant final order, condition 1 only for a period of six months starting from today's date.
the thing is when people are in the throes of a bad break-up, it is sometimes not easy to keep your cool but you have to, because you are in breach of the law and you do not start smashing people's property and what you have. i consider that you obviously were upset to be filmed, it is extremely intrusive and i am sure that you were upset about that, which is why i dealt with the matter as leniently as i have. i have not convicted you. however, where there is a finding of guilt, i was, as you can see, reluctant to impose an avo in a situation like that, but i am actually obliged to because there is a finding of guilt.[1]
why would you want the mother to vent on your kids - why would you provoke that situation?
to which he responded:
i didn't want to provoke her, i didn't think [ms ad] [the maternal grandmother] was actually coming.
he was then again asked by mr wong:
why would you provoke her to vent her emotions on you and the kids?
the mother would get upset, and when she was upset she would restrict access by myself and my mother to the kids.
that was not an answer to the question he was asked.   16 november 2019 from 9:00am until 1:00pm, (b) 20 and 21 november 2019 from 3:15pm until 7:00pm on each day, (c) 22 november 2019 for four hours at x's school without supervision by bb contact centre, (d) 23 november 2019 from 1 pm for four hours, and (e) 28 and 30 november 2019, and 4, 5 and 8 december 2019 for various times. a contact report was provided by bb contact centre for each occasion and all those reports are exhibited to the mother's affidavit at -08, and all indicate an excellent, close and loving relationship between the mother and the children.   20 and 21 november 2019 from 3:15pm until 7:00pm on each day, (c) 22 november 2019 for four hours at x's school without supervision by bb contact centre, (d) 23 november 2019 from 1 pm for four hours, and (e) 28 and 30 november 2019, and 4, 5 and 8 december 2019 for various times. a contact report was provided by bb contact centre for each occasion and all those reports are exhibited to the mother's affidavit at -08, and all indicate an excellent, close and loving relationship between the mother and the children.   22 november 2019 for four hours at x's school without supervision by bb contact centre, (d) 23 november 2019 from 1 pm for four hours, and (e) 28 and 30 november 2019, and 4, 5 and 8 december 2019 for various times. a contact report was provided by bb contact centre for each occasion and all those reports are exhibited to the mother's affidavit at -08, and all indicate an excellent, close and loving relationship between the mother and the children.   23 november 2019 from 1 pm for four hours, and (e) 28 and 30 november 2019, and 4, 5 and 8 december 2019 for various times. a contact report was provided by bb contact centre for each occasion and all those reports are exhibited to the mother's affidavit at -08, and all indicate an excellent, close and loving relationship between the mother and the children.   28 and 30 november 2019, and 4, 5 and 8 december 2019 for various times. a contact report was provided by bb contact centre for each occasion and all those reports are exhibited to the mother's affidavit at -08, and all indicate an excellent, close and loving relationship between the mother and the children.

you will receive further correspondence from my office shortly as to my client's proposed arrangements moving forward.
the email contained assurances that the children were safe and well and at no risk, but did not specify that the children would be residing at the maternal grandmother's home at suburb w. the father says in paragraph 218 of his affidavit that the email advised:
...that [ms melounis] would not be returning the children to my care, and further was taking the children to [city aj].
i observed them to be very reserved and quiet in their manner. however, physically they seemed fine.

...that provide for [ms melounis] to remain in sydney, then i will continue to support her. however, my support will be limited by the distance in which i live from [ms melounis]. i simply cannot provide [ms melounis] or the children with the same support that i could if they lived in [city aj].
mr maurice: if the court gives you a live-with order, do you think it will make it harder for the father to see the children if they move to the [city aj] area? mother: no. mr maurice: surely it will make it harder? mother: yes. mr maurice: it's about 170 kilometres from [suburb d] to the [city aj] cbd? mother yes. mr maurice: two hours travel? mother: yes. mr maurice: there's often a bottleneck just passed [suburb bl]? mother: yes. mr maurice: it can be over two hours? mother: yes. mr maurice: so a move to [city aj] must reduce the time the father can spend with the children? mother: yes. mr maurice: you say the children are your first priority? mother: yes. mr maurice: you say it's best for the children to live with you? mother: yes.
would you remain in sydney if the court says that the children are to live in sydney?
to which the mother replied, “yes”.
mr maurice: do you agree that the greatest risk to the children in maintaining a meaningful relationship with their father is if they live in [city aj] with their mother? ms h: yes, i make it very clear that i do not support the relocation for that reason.
can you not mention this to [mr melounis], please? he will be pissed, he is always telling me not to pull the kids by the arm.
and then records from a conversation later that day between himself and the father that he said to the father words to the effect of:
she asked me not to tell you, as she said you would be upset given you had told her she was being too rough with the kids, dragging them by one arm when she was upset at them.
i am not harassing. i am asking you and your family to leave me alone! stop threatening me and my kids!
they are not your kids.
perhaps aligning himself with the father's attitude that it must always be "our kids" as between the mother and the father.   melounis]. if you continue to refuse to leave my house i'll be forced to call the police. please leave. [mr s].
however, the mother had left his house, indeed his property, and was standing on the footpath outside the property.
evidence particular to the financial aspects of the matter
throughout the relationship, [mr melounis] was the primary income-earner and i was the primary parent and homemaker.
your brothers were paid and your father-in-law was not.
to which she responded, “yes”.
i was very confused as i did not agree to any loans and i also do not recall receiving any funds from [mr melounis's] father.   $37,120 on criminal legal fees, (b) $46,484.85 on family law legal fees, (c) $4,300.26 on costs associated with her motor vehicle, (d) approximately $12,000 on living expenses, (e) approximately $6000 on the children's expenses being a total of $105,905.11.   $46,484.85 on family law legal fees, (c) $4,300.26 on costs associated with her motor vehicle, (d) approximately $12,000 on living expenses, (e) approximately $6000 on the children's expenses being a total of $105,905.11.   $4,300.26 on costs associated with her motor vehicle, (d) approximately $12,000 on living expenses, (e) approximately $6000 on the children's expenses being a total of $105,905.11.   approximately $12,000 on living expenses, (e) approximately $6000 on the children's expenses being a total of $105,905.11.   approximately $6000 on the children's expenses being a total of $105,905.11.
being a total of $105,905.11.
the evidence of the single expert witness –ms ah
it appears the children were exposed in a fairly relentless and unprotected manner in 2019 to fighting between their parents and the involvement of police on many of these occasions. this would have been distressing, confusing and highly anxiety provoking for the children. both parties have indicated that at times, [x] was very upset by their fighting and he would try to intervene.
the children would also have been significantly impacted by the way their mother - who at the time had been their primary caregiver since birth - suddenly disappeared for a month and the only contact they had with her was via facetime calls, and that it was a further month after that before they spent any overnight time with her.
the father has expressed the belief that the mother has serious mental health issues in regard to her lack of capacity for emotional regulation. he "sent" her to a clinical psychologist, [dr r], in april 2019, who found that the mother did not have a problem with anger, nor any other underlying or overt mental health issues.   melounis] described being able to live in [city aj] with the children, "as my ideal scenario. because that's where my family are. i have more support, and availability of babysitting and housing is more affordable.”
the report writer asked [mr melounis] several times about what happened with the maternal great grandfather, but he appeared to obfuscate, to the extent that even in answer to the most direct normal question: "what happened between you in relation to [ms melounis’] grandfather's money?" [mr melounis] said, "the investigation about trading was hanging over me until 2017. so, there was a lot of stress there. she was sending text messages to her brother, saying she didn't need any money, because (apparently) i would support her. but that wasn't the issue, it was her obsessiveness about the children."   melounis] that he dates their separation from may 2019, "because we were living separate lives. we weren't having sex, we weren't going to family things together. i started putting things in writing because she kept bombarding me with messages and calls. i had the cameras installed in june 2019 and the safe installed in july 2019. she was becoming increasingly agitated, over nothing. (if we fought) i would have 150 missed calls from her! i had to block her from so many accounts (including a work email)." [mr melounis] prevaricated when asked if he had had a direct conversation (at any point) with [ms melounis] about his view that the parties were separated. he repeated that it was "obvious" what was going on.   melounis] said that he formed a belief that [ms melounis] needed professional help and he researched and found [dr r] and also the [y counsellors] course, "managing strong emotions". the report writer asked if [mr melounis] has promised [ms melounis] that they would attend this course together. somewhat curiously, he answered, "yes, i probably did agree to go," but he could not recall why he only attended one session.   melounis] said that he started working with [y counsellors] and [ak families] around april 2019. (subpoenaed records indicate that he referred himself to [ak families] on 10 july and in early august to [y counsellors]).   melounis] said that around this time [mid to later 2019], and through speaking with the family support worker, he formed a view that the children were no longer safe to be around their mother when he wasn't there. [mr melounis] said that he decided to, "start sitting with [ms melounis] (when she was angry) and just letting her vent, deescalating her. it was kind of working, the empathy approach." in september 2019, however, this approach didn't work and [mr melounis] recalled that, "we were arguing and she grabbed the kids and we started recording each other and she was going through my bag and then she grabbed my phone and threw it. then she dragged the kids with her upstairs. [x] was really upset. when the police came, i didn't want her charged but they told me they had to. (subpoenaed records make no reference to mr melounis saying this to the police, only that he feared for his future safety if there were no intervention.)
on 15 october 2019 [mr melounis] emailed the case worker and spoke about [ms melounis'] threats of self-harm (already reported) and her threatening to "take the children to an unknown location" which had prompted him to call the police. he also discussed the upcoming court case for the mobile phone incident and expressed frustration that the police prosecutor was not taking it seriously enough.   melounis] said that he sought help from [ak families] in terms of how he should best respond to [ms melounis] when she would behave aggressively towards him. he said that he was advised to, "stop trying to change [ms melounis] and to think about what i can do. stop putting pressure on x. modify my own behaviour, to reduce conflict. i still need reminding about that sometimes though!"
they both acknowledged her quite shyly, smiling but holding themselves back. [y] clung anxiously to her father and only separated from him when her mother gently encouraged her. [mr melounis] stood there quite passively and did not assist the children.
she reminded them that they would be coming to [city aj] with her the following day. [x] immediately asked if he could go with her "now" and [ms melounis] gently but firmly said that would not be possible because they needed to stay with their father, [x] accepted this.
in the middle of this, [x] randomly said, "i want to go back to [city aj] and see mummy." [mr melounis] said, "yes, you can do that tomorrow." [x] nodded and they kept looking at the book.
there were certainly many calls made to the police - all but two by [mr melounis]. [the records note that the other two were by neighbours of the parties]. these calls began in june 2019 but ramp up significantly in july 2019. there are multiple "events" recorded in july 2019 but they are all minor, with the police characterising them as "petty disputes". around this time, it became evident that [mr melounis] had decided to cease trying to resolve the conflict in a constructive manner, and he resorted to repeatedly involving the police, either by calling them or reporting [ms melounis] to them. this was at the same time that [mr melounis] sought help from both [y counsellors] and [ak families], ostensibly to ensure the children weren't harmed by the conflict and to seek guidance on how to best respond to [ms melounis]. it is difficult to reconcile these conflicting behaviours. one hypothesis is that by constantly involving the police to mediate/arbitrate disputes and naming [ms melounis] as the sole cause of these arguments, and then seeking professional guidance but not involving [ms melounis] in this (to enable a fuller picture to be drawn of what was actually occurring), [mr melounis] was able to construct a narrative where he was the helpless but well-intentioned victim and [ms melounis] was the uncontained and dangerous perpetrator. [mr melounis] told the report writer that he "strongly encouraged" [ms melounis] to attend [ak families] as well, the subpoenaed records however indicate that he said that he did not wish for [ms melounis] to be involved.
at paragraph 181:
the other hypothesis is that [mr melounis] did spiral out of control in the last six months of 2019, to the extent that [mr melounis] felt he had no other option than to involve the police and that he sought professional support in the manner he did as a means of extricating himself from the marriage and protecting the children while he did so.
further, at paragraph 182:
both of these hypotheses have prima facie validity and ultimately will need to be assessed on the evidence.   melounis] laid the blame for these incidents squarely at [ms melounis'] feet, and the report writer is of the view that it is likely that [ms melounis] did behave in ways that would have caused the children emotional harm. the responsibility for her choices in these situations rests solely with [ms melounis] and - based on her narrative and what she has deposed - it appears that her insight into the harm her actions wrought on the children through 2019 is minimal.
the report writer is also troubled though, by the way in which [mr melounis] has presented himself as the victim and as the loving and concerned father, when an analysis of his behaviours, both pre and post-separation, suggest that his motives may not be as pure as he suggests. the behaviours that are particularly concerning are the extent to which [mr melounis] used the police to resolve the couple's disputes, without regard to the impact of this on the children, the way that he constantly filmed [ms - misstated in the report as mr] [melounis] knowing that this was a trigger for her rage (noting that this does not absolve [ms melounis] of blame for how she responded but that it remains evidence of a somewhat calculated approach on [mr melounis'] part (which again was more than likely to impact on the children), and what appears to be his pattern of shutting down arguments by walking away, which included being nonresponsive to [ms melounis] for extended periods of time.
post-separation, [mr melounis] continued to use the police in a manner which the report writer finds quite alarming. the issues were minor, even trivial and none of these reports have resulted in a breach of [ms melounis'] avo. in the three month period between the end of october 2019 and the beginning of february 2020, [mr melounis] reported [ms melounis] on six separate occasions. it is difficult to understand the intent behind this behaviour as anything but self-serving and malicious.
the events of march 2020 do not reflect well on either party. regrettably, the children would have suffered as a result of both their father's seeming unwillingness to be flexible in the middle of a global pandemic and their mother's impulsive behaviour in response to this inflexibility.
observations of the children with their parents suggests that they have a warm and loving relationship with each of them. the children's play in each session was consistent and unremarkable, both parents responded to them warmly and in an emotionally attuned manner, although [mr melounis] was much more serious and intense in comparison to [ms melounis'] more energetic and upbeat approach. the only noticeable difference was how [y] vocalised significantly more with her father, which could indicate she felt more comfortable in his presence, however it is not possible to be definitive about this, based on one interaction in an unfamiliar space.
the supervision reports from [bb contact centre] in november and december 2019 suggest that [ms melounis] is a competent, warm and emotionally responsive parent. ...[x] was noted on more than on occasion to be "inconsolable" when his mother was due to leave and he would often plead with her to stay. on the other hand, both children were noted to settle relatively quickly once she did leave.
...it becomes imperative to focus on what the children will need from both of their parents going forward and to assess to what extent each parent has insight into and is able to competently and confidently meet those needs.
at paragraph 195:   melounis] expressed the view that [ms melounis] is a "high energy and creative" mother but he is concerned by her emotional unpredictably. he alleged that she would scream at the children if they annoyed her and there was "no consistency" in her responses to them. however, when the report writer asked for examples and queried how [mr melounis] intervened at these times (to protect the children) he wasn't able to answer this question. ...[mr melounis] also made no allegations about [ms melounis'] parenting capacity or mental health prior to events of 2019 and neither did the paternal grandmother.
further, at paragraph 196:
this suggests that [ms melounis] is, on balance, a good mother whose capacity to focus on what her children need from her was (perhaps substantially) impaired in 2019 as a result of the conflict between her and [mr melounis] and her struggle to regulate her emotions and separate the children's needs from hers. it would therefore be likely that in a less stressful environment, and with limited or no contact with [mr melounis], [ms melounis] would pose minimal risk to the children.   melounis] is proposing, on both an interim and final basis, to be able to relocate to [city aj] with the children. this would mean yet another major change for the children (as it would involve new schools and childcare centre) and it would reduce the time they spend with their father from nine nights per fortnight to two, and an afternoon a week (which is logistically problematic given the distance between the houses). [ms melounis'] discussion of her reasons for wanting to relocate were superficial and other than being closer to her family, she was unable to articulate any compelling reasons. she appeared dismissive of the impact of this move on the children. this proposal is not child-focused, it is parent-focused. the proposal itself indicates that [ms melounis] may not sufficiently value the children's relationship with their father and she is prepared to sacrifice both that, as well as the children's emotional needs, to obtain what she wants, which appears to be to "win" the children back from [mr melounis].
...there is nothing to suggest that [mr melounis] would not be able to consistently meet the children's developmental needs on a day-to-day basis.
further, at paragraph 199:
the report writer is concerned, however, about [mr melounis'] capacity to support the children's relationship with their mother. he has engaged in behaviours which suggest his intentions towards her are not benign, in particular his repeated calls to the police between november 2019 and february 2020 and his refusal to consider her proposal that the children divide their time between sydney and [city aj] during the covid-19 lockdown, given [ms melounis'] very limited options in regard to organising ongoing accommodation in sydney (and which belies [mr melounis'] strongly stated view that the children need stability).
the report writer's view is that there are too many risks associated with a parenting arrangement that gives either parent primary care, for the reasons identified above. if the children are to be protected from further emotional harm, they require a parenting plan that does not rely on the parties coming into contact with each other and one that offers them substantial time with each parent, without too long away from either parent.   the parties equally share parental responsibility for the children, (2) the children live with their parents in sydney in an arrangement where in: (i) week 1 they are with their father from monday to wednesday, with their mother from wednesday to friday and with their father from friday to monday, and (ii) week 2 that they are with their mother from monday to wednesday, with their father from wednesday to friday and then with their mother from friday to monday - this provides a shared care arrangement on a two/three/two basis each week.

i formed the view that neither parent was capable of supporting the children's relationship with the other parent and if there was a primary carer the children's relationship with the other parent may deteriorate even further due to the influence of the main carer. i see that as a significant risk. an equal shared care arrangement takes that out of the equation to a large extent and it is less likely that the children's relationship with one parent will diminish due to the influence of the other parent. also, with the ages of the children, to be away from either parent for a significant time if there is a shared care arrangement should not occur.

section 60cc - the primary considerations
..."meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". ...when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitative one. quantitative concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.
i formed the view that neither parent was capable of supporting the children's relationship with the other parent and if there is a primary carer, the children's relationship with the other parent may deteriorate even further due to the influence of the main carer. i see that as a significant risk.
section 60cc - the additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the children's views.
the nature of the relationship of each of the children with each of their parents and with other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the children).
the extent to which each of the children's parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the children, and to spend time with the children, and to communicate with the children.
the extent to which each of the children's parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil the parent's obligation to maintain the children.
the likely effect of any changes in the children's circumstances including the likely effect on the children of any separation from either of their parents or any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the children) with whom the children have been living.
i acknowledge that [y] and [x] have lived in [suburb d] their whole lives and they have connections to the community. whilst i would do whatever it takes to have a close relationship with the children, it remains my view that i cannot live permanently in the [suburb d] area. i do not have any support from [mr melounis's] family and feel quite isolated. ...[suburb d] is also highly expensive and not affordable comparative to the [city aj] region.
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the children's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis.
the capacity of each of the children's parents and any other person (including any grandparent) to provide for the needs of the children, including their emotional and intellectual needs.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of the children's parents, and any other characteristics of the children that the court thinks are relevant.
the attitude to the children and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the children's parents.
any family violence involving the children or a member of the children's family.
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child's family - any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in the proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter.
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child.
section 61da - the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
section 65daa - equal time or substantial and significant time
is an order that the children spend equal time with each of their parents reasonably practicable?
the parties have liberty to facetime or telephone the children when they are not in their care between 5:00pm and 6:00pm as arranged with the other parent during school terms and during school holidays each wednesday and sunday.[21]
the law – property settlement issues
property settlement under section 79 of the act  the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in property, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, (b) the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (c) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[27]   the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (c) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[27]   the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[27]
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[29]   first, “the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities, and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing”,[31] (b) second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [32] (c) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[33] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[34]   second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [32] (c) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[33] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[34]   third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[33] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[34]   fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[34]
indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis (1986) 161 clr 513).[37]  ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial “product” or “value”. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent “causal connection” might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the “...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...” or, indeed, to “property” at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to:
... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse’s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[40]
...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.[43]
as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.[45]
addbacks ] to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are: (a) where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm v jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) 23 fam lr 396 the full court said (at 410-411):   where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm v jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) 23 fam lr 396 the full court said (at 410-411):
11.6 for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in in marriage of townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said (at 509): in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly. (c) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in in marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70, [1981] flc 91-092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.  where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in in marriage of townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said (at 509):   in the circumstances outlined by baker j in in marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70, [1981] flc 91-092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances:
conduct of the kind referred to in para. (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under sec 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of sec 79.
[31] as the full court said in browne v green [1999] famca 1483, [1999] flc 92-873 at 86,360:
[44] we agree with her honour that the principles stated by baker j in kowaliw certainly do not constitute any form of fixed code. they are no more than guidelines for use in the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction conferred by s 79 of the family law act 1975. nevertheless, they have over the considerable period of time since they were enunciated, become a well accepted guideline in this jurisdiction — a guideline the use of which assists in the achievement of the important goal of consistency within the jurisdiction.[48]
where one party unilaterally distributes to themselves property which no longer exists and which, but for that premature distribution, would be susceptible to section 79 orders, justice and equity may require the court to take account of the dissipated property by adding it back as against the dissipating party (townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569). whether that should occur, or whether the dissipation should be taken into account pursuant to section 75(2)(o), or indeed at all, are all matters requiring the exercise of a trial judge’s discretion (in the marriage of ad and ac townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569, omacini & omacini, cerini & cerini [1998] famca 143).[50]  7] at [50] to [65] of the first reasons under the heading “add-backs,” the trial judge held that $25,000 withdrawn by the husband from the parties’ bank accounts post-separation should be added back into the pool of assets, and further concluded that $50,000 which the husband had, post-separation, paid to his parents, purportedly in repayment of a loan from them, should also be added back. [138] there is no error committed per se in adjusting the parties’ actual property interests by a calculation involving notionally adding back into the pool sums which have been dissipated by the parties. we reject any suggestion that the decision of bevan & bevan [2013] famcafc 116, (2013) flc 93-545 – or, more particularly, the decision of the high court in stanford & stanford [2012] hca 52, (2012) 247 clr 108 - is authority for any necessary contrary solution. some statements made by the high court may lead to the conclusion that references to “notional property” as have been referred to in decisions of this court and at first instance may need to be reconsidered. [139] the decisions referred to seek to remind the court that, however the exercise of discretion might seek to deal with property that is said to be the subject of “add back”, proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property, and the question posed by s 79(2) as a separate inquiry from any adjustment to property interests by reference to s 79(4) if a consideration of s 79(2) reveals that it is just and equitable to alter existing interests in property.[51]  ] we observe that “notional property”, which is sometimes “added back” to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute “property of the parties to the marriage or either of them”, and thus is not amenable to alteration under section 79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage – and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that section 79(4) and in particular section 75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property.[52]  ] ...the way in which non-existent property is to be treated remains a matter for judicial discretion (see townsend & townsend flc 92-569) ... the provision of an agreed balance sheet providing for the inclusion of notional property would not mandate his honour’s acceptance of it or that he would treat the notional property in the same way as had the parties.[53]  0] ...a court cannot create property for the purposes of alteration. section 79 empowers a court to alter interests of the parties to the proceedings in property. property is defined in section 4 of the act to mean:
... [in] relation to the parties to a marriage or either of them – means property to which those parties are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or reversion.  1] as french cj said in kennon & spry [2008] hca 56, (2008) 238 clr 366 at 390, “‘property’ in section 79 is to be read as part of the collocation ‘property of the parties to the marriage’”. it is to be read widely and conformably with the purposes of the act. gummow and hayne jj said at 397 that “the term ‘property’ is not a term of art with one specific and precise meaning”. the purpose of the act as set out in section 79(1) is to alter interests in property to which a party has an interest in possession or reversion.[54]
guidelines for adding back to the property available at trial dissipation of property and expenditure other than on legal fees
[27] the full court held in omacini and omacini[55] that addbacks fall into “three clear categories”: where the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and “waste” or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets.[56] ] however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever “a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation”, the full court describing such a proposition as “unduly simplistic”.[57] an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is “the exception rather than the rule”.[58] [29] the fundamental precept that addbacks are exceptional, reflected in the decisions just referred to, also mirrors what has been said in earlier decisions of the full court that, for example, “the family court must take the property of a party to the marriage as it finds it”[59] at trial. an important parallel proposition is that the parties do not “go into a state of suspended economic animation” after separation.[60] thus, reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback. [30] two fundamental premises emerge from omacini and the authorities preceding it. first, “adding back” is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.[61] (b) expenditure on legal fees [31] to the considerations just discussed must be added the propositions emerging from authority that paid legal fees as a category of addback is imbued with considerations specific to that expenditure. the full court said in chorn:  ] in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. [57] if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. [58] if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post‑separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post‑separation income or acquisitions.  ] those passages can be seen as an attempt to establish “guidelines”,[62] undertaken after a detailed examination of earlier authorities,[63] for the treatment of paid legal fees within s 79 proceedings. there can be little doubt that the statements made in that case have been applied by trial judges ever since. [33] the word “guidelines” is used advisedly so as to distinguish the same from “binding principles of law”.[64] the distinction is important. failure to follow a binding principle of law is an error of law. by contrast, the failure of a trial judge to follow a guideline:[65]
...does not of itself amount to error, for it may appear that the case is one in which it is inappropriate to invoke the guideline or that, notwithstanding the failure to apply it, the decision is the product of sound discretionary judgment. [however] [t]he failure to apply a legitimate guideline to a situation to which it is applicable may ... throw a question mark over the trial judge’s decision and ease the appellant’s burden of showing that it is wrong...  ] the guidelines emerging from chorn should be read together and read conformably with the full court authorities upon which they are based. that being so, the delineations there referred to — “the funds used existed at separation ... such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them”, or “funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours” or received by a party “in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)” - cannot be seen as determinative of the exercise of discretion but, rather, as informing it. [35] again, the matters just referred to have important ramifications in an appellate context. they may ease the appellant’s burden of showing that “although the nature of the error may not be discoverable ... a substantial wrong has in fact occurred”,[66] or that the decision is “plainly wrong, [the] decision being no proper exercise of [the] judicial discretion”.[67] equally, they may ease the burden of establishing that irrelevant considerations have been taken into account or that relevant considerations have not been taken into account. [36] paid legal fees occupy a particular position in the consideration of addbacks by reason of s 117(1) of the act, a matter not relevant to any other form of expenditure or dissipation of property the subject of an addback claim. [37] an order failing to addback legal costs is a pre-emptive decision about one party paying the other’s legal costs. the statutorily prescribed default position is that neither party pays all or some of the other party’s costs.[68] [38] if, contrary to the demands of that section, there is to be a payment of costs, the award is dependent upon a finding of justifying circumstances which, in turn, is dependent upon (non-exhaustive) considerations all of which are informed by antecedent events - for example, whether one party has been “wholly unsuccessful” and “the conduct of the parties to the proceedings”.[69] an award of the costs of trial, if any, is in the usual run of events made after the respective entitlements of the parties to a settlement of property have been assessed and, importantly, any awarded costs are paid from the assessed entitlement to property received by the paying party. [39] as has been said, legitimate guidelines “guide the exercise of a discretion”, they do not replace it.[70] guidelines, must “[preserve], so far as it is possible to do so, the capacity ... to do justice according to the needs of the individual case”.[71] the decision to addback or not addback paid legal fees remains a matter of discretion. but, a finding that it is just and equitable to not addback an amount of legal fees so paid is a finding that it is just and equitable for the other party to contribute to the costs of the first party in that proportion as part of an overall assessment of the justice and equity governing their property division. [40] the considerations just referred to are plainly always important and central to the exercise of that discretion in respect of paid legal fees. [41] the passages from chorn, quoted above, draw a distinction between legal costs met from property that would otherwise be available at trial and legal costs met from funds “generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)”. the proposition there advanced, that such expenditure “would generally not be added back”, also needs to be seen as a guideline informing the relevant discretion rather than determining it. a further distinction is suggested in chorn between funds generated in that manner and “[f]unds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement”. [42] the latter suggestion recognises the discretion inherent in the task and also, perhaps, that in the particular circumstances of a case, adding back sums generated post-separation in the different manners suggested might create injustice as much as it might cure it.[72]
...  ] in stanford v stanford,[73] the high court emphasised as fundamental that a consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order begins by “identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property”.[74] [47] the essence of a claim for addbacks is that the asserted sum/s should be added to the value of the existing property interests of the parties and, subsequent to the assessment of contributions, credited to the spending party as part of the value of their assessed entitlements. doing so does not offend what was emphasised by the high court. adding back does not seek to create property interests that do not exist. rather, doing so emphasises that satisfying the respective requirements of ss 79(2) and (4) of the act to do justice and equity can require an “accounting” or “balance sheet” exercise for the purposes of s 79(2) and (4), so as to include the value of the dissipated property or expended sums within the total value of the parties’ existing interests in property, and to credit the value of same against the assessed entitlement of the dissipating or spending party.[75]
any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account.
the loan is unable to be established on the balance of probabilities, not enforceable given the terms are unlikely to be enforced per biltoft.   as a general practice developed over the years in section 79 matters, the court ascertains the value of the property of the parties to the marriage by deducting from the value of their assets the value of their total liabilities. in the case of incumbent assets the value is ascertained by deducting the amount of the secured liability from the gross value of the asset. where assets are not encumbered and monies are owed by the parties or one of them to unsecured creditors the court ascertains the value of their property by deducting from the value of their assets the value of their liabilities, including unsecured liabilities. (2) the court may properly determine not to take into account, or to discount the value of, an unsecured liability in certain circumstances. examples are liabilities that are vague or uncertain, unlikely to be enforced or where the liability was unreasonably incurred. (3) the general rule that the court treats liabilities in the way outlined in (1) and (2) is not absolute and is not prescribed by statute and there are a number of well recognised exceptions. there is no requirement that the rights of an unsecured creditor or a claim by a third party must be considered and dealt with prior to the court making orders under section 79, nor is there a rule of priority as between a creditor claimant and a spouse. the rights of third-party creditors, however, cannot be ignored, they must be recognised and taken into account and balanced against the rights of the spouse. (4) if in the course of proceeding the rights of a third-party creditor or claimant are likely to be affected, then interests of justice dictate that notice of the proceedings must be given to that creditor or claimant to afford the opportunity to intervene.   the court may properly determine not to take into account, or to discount the value of, an unsecured liability in certain circumstances. examples are liabilities that are vague or uncertain, unlikely to be enforced or where the liability was unreasonably incurred.

first, it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property ... the question posed by section 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order.

is it just and equitable in all the circumstances, to make an order under section 79 of the act?
...the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship ... there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife ... [and] the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship ... any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order.[77]
what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying section 79(4).
