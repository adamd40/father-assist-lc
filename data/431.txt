the nature of an undefended hearing
before a person can be adversely affected by a judicial order, they must be afforded an adequate opportunity to be heard.[3]  e wife] is entitled to have her application for settlement of property matters determined within a reasonable period of time pursuant to the applicable principles of law. this is important, given the delays which have arisen in the conduct of the case, none of which are attributable to any act or omission attributable to [the wife]. as such, she needs neither [the husband’s] formal imprimatur, nor his cooperation to have her application determined. rather, there is an obligation, on the part of [the husband] if he wishes to be involved in the proceedings for him to attend at court as required and to pursue any application put by him or on his behalf with due diligence. the federal circuit court and family court is a court of private law. it determines disputes between parties according to law. in this case, according to the provisions of part viii of the family law act 1975 (cth) (‘the act’) which relate to the division of property following the breakdown of a de facto relationship. the court cannot compel a party to engage with litigation. it is however obliged to give each party the opportunity to put evidence before the court and, if he or she so wishes to do, contest any evidence relied upon by the opposing party. however, a party, whether by intransigence, disinterest or manipulation, cannot succeed in denying an applicant a just resolution according to law to his or her application by choosing not to take part in proceedings because they do not proceed in the manner of his or her preference. that would be fundamentally unfair to the opposing party and an affront to the proper administration of justice which requires that a properly instituted application be finalised within a reasonable period of time relative to the complexity and issues raised in such an application.[4]   for the purposes of rule 10.27, an applicant is in default if the applicant fails (a) comply with an order of the court in the proceeding, or (b) file and serve a document required under these rules, or (c) produce a document as required by division 6.2.2, or (d) do any act required to be done by these rules, or (e) prosecute the proceeding with due diligence.[5]
