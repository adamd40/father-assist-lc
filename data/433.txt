[10] we note that similar views have been expressed in other jurisdictions. for instance, in aluminium louvres & ceilings pty ltd v zheng (2006) 4 ddcr 358 (“aluminium louvres”), bryson ja (with whom handley ja and bell j agreed) at [32] stated that the absence of the transcript of proceedings before a conciliation commission arbitrator was a “serious shortcoming, because it greatly impedes the right of appeal and the due exercise of powers” of the appellate body. also at [32], his honour continued “[a]ccording to circumstances, the absence of a sound recording could fairly readily lead a presidential member to a decision to require a rehearing, although that result would not be automatic”.   the transcript from 26 august 2020 was not available due to a technical malfunction by

verbal evidence
the law
... when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a near mechanical comparison of probabilities, independently of any belief in its reality... it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. by reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent likelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.   whether the child spending equal time with each parent would be in the best interest of the child,[11] and (2) whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[12]   whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[12]
a discretionary judgment concerning the parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[14]   assess whether that risk is an acceptable risk or an unacceptable risk, (2) if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.  ] in considering an allegation of sexual abuse, the court should not make a positive finding that the allegation is true unless the court is so satisfied according to the civil standard of proof, with due regard to the factors mentioned in briginshaw v briginshaw [1938] hca 34, (1938) 60 clr 336 at 362 ... [23] no doubt there will be some cases in which the court is able to come to a positive finding that the allegation is well-founded. in all but the most extraordinary cases, that finding will have a decisive impact on the order to be made respecting custody and access. there will be cases also in which the court has no hesitation in rejecting the allegation as groundless ... [24] in resolving the wider issue the court must determine whether on the evidence there is a risk of sexual abuse occurring if custody or access be granted and assessing the magnitude of that risk. after all, in deciding what is in the best interests of a child, the family court is frequently called upon to assess and evaluate the likelihood or possibility of events or occurrences which, if they come about, will have a detrimental impact on the child's welfare. the existence and magnitude of the risk of sexual abuse, as with other risks of harm to the welfare of a child, is a fundamental matter to be taken into account in deciding issues of custody and access. in access cases, the magnitude of the risk may be less if the order in contemplation is supervised access ... [25] ... in devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. to achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse.  1] ... we accept as a matter of practice, a trial judge will almost inevitably be required in a case where sexual abuse allegations are raised to consider whether abuse has been proven on the balance of probabilities as well as considering whether or not an unacceptable risk of abuse exists ...  ] in his recent paper entitled ‘unacceptable risk – a return to basics’ the hon. john fogarty a.m. set out his summary of the principles emerging from m and m as follows:
1 the decisive issue is and always remains the best interests of that child. all other issues are subservient. 2 the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable. 3 where past abuse of a child is alleged it is usually neither necessary nor desirable to reach a definitive conclusion on that issue. where, however, that is done the briginshaw civil standard of proof applies. 4 the circumstance, if it be so, that the allegation of past abuse is not proved in accordance with briginshaw, does not impede reliance upon those circumstances in determining whether there is an unacceptable risk. 5 the concentration in these cases should normally be upon the question whether there is an unacceptable risk to the child. 6 the onus of proof in reaching that conclusion is the ordinary civil standard. 7 but the components which go to make up that conclusion need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of unacceptable risk from the accumulation of factors, none or some only of which, are proved to that standard.
and thereafter expanded some points contained in the summary.  ] frequently, (i would respectfully venture, too frequently) “risk” is referred to as an all-embracing term, a “general” finding of which can (purportedly) be seen to have some form of “ipso facto consequences” for the orders made. yet, “risk” is, without more, but a convenient description, orders must, surely, address its constituent components which must, axiomatically, vary according to the circumstances of each case. [72] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said:
risk assessment in any situation involves, in essence, the asking of the following questions: (1) what harmful outcome is potentially present in this situation? (2) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (3) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (4) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (5) what measures are available whose deployment could mitigate the risks that are probable? (b. mahendra, 'psychiatric risk assessment in family and child law' (2008) 38 family law 569).  ] mr fogarty, writing in the australian journal of family law said this (20 ajfl 249 at 254-5):
... the reality is that all courts deal with issues of "risk" and degrees of risk (however described) in various situations and that concept is increasingly used in legislation. risk is difficult to define in a way which is not ultimately circular. but it is an inevitable part of life at all its levels. it is inherently risky to breathe, eat, drink, walk, drive, work, invest and play. the world is full of different risks and consequences and everyone is prone to dangers. we confront varying levels of risk everyday. people frequently face potentially dangerous situations, not many live at home in complete isolation to avoid getting in harms way. most people try to avoid what they perceive to be risk, some willingly take on high risk activities. risk involves two component, the degree of "likelihood" of the happening of an event, and the possible consequences (good or bad) if it does [cases and citations omitted]. individuals in their assessment of some risks may focus more on one than the other of these components. but at some point it usually becomes necessary for that person to make a judgment of the risk and whether it can/should be taken. where the risk relates to a third person to whom one owes a responsibility, it is likely in the nature of things that the estimate will be conservative. risks are relative and usually involve trade-offs. crossing the road with oncoming traffic to catch the last connection to the airport involves the risk of being hit by a car or the risk of missing the plane. very much a balancing exercise of facts, experience and intuition, but essentially which risk carries the greater detriment (usually the car). then there is the common experience of a mother watching her child cross a road to go to school. the risk is seen as greater (although it may not be) because the consequences may be death or injury to the child and because the responsibilities of the mother will be seen by her as greater than for herself or another adult .... at times the courts and the legislature have attempted to give an indication of the content or quality of the risk -- otherwise “risk” may mean any risk, however small or unlikely. hence the use of adjectives such as “serious”, “grave”, “real”, “appreciable” and “unacceptable”.  ] i respectfully agree, as i also do with mr fogarty's statement (which also has echoes in the english author's statement earlier quoted) that:
... unacceptable risk in the high court's formulation [in m v m (1988) 166 clr 69] requires two separate steps. is there a risk, and is it unacceptable? the concentration by the high court is upon both the nature and the degree of risk in the particular case. its formulation is all about balance. in some cases a risk is "acceptable" when balanced against other factors and other orders. the object of safeguards is to convert an unacceptable situation to an acceptable one where that is feasible and is of "benefit to the child". it is, as i suggested earlier, calibrated to its use in individual cases. it is unrelated to the exoneration or otherwise of the alleged abuser, it is all about the bests interests of the child and protection from risk
the evidence
assertions of family violence in 2003
... with significant force, slamming me into the outside of the doorframe. he shook me, hitting me against the wall and then still gripping the tops of my arms pulled me towards him, turned us around about 45 degrees, so my back was to the stairwell and then pushed me with both hands hard and i fell roughly down about 10 stairs.
hey, if i buy a random phone will an o2 chip fit in it?
she later told me [mr bergeron] had been trying to force her to abort the baby. [mr bergeron] had booked her in for an abortion at the clinic in 2003 and when [ms bergeron] refused to go with him to the appointment, he pushed her down the steep stairs in her flat in [city br].
... when she had been pregnant with [v] in 2003, [mr bergeron] had got angry with her and pushed her down the stairs.
[v]’s early years
when i raised the idea of spending time with [v] with my mum there for support, [mr bergeron] said words to the effect of, ‘that’s not something i’m interested in. i’m here to see you’. we spoke about what arrangements would look like long-term. i said, ‘mum would only be there until you’re able to look after him alone.’
mr schonell: there’s no suggestion there of fear that he may harm your child, correct? mother: correct[22]
mr schonell: the first year. so how many times do you say he saw [v] in the first year? mother: two or three times. mr schonell: two or three times. and who was present? mother: myself, [v] and [mr bergeron]. mr schonell: so you’re in fear of being harmed by him because he has thrown you down the stairs, and you accepted that? mother: yes. mr schonell: yes. you’re in fear that he might harm your baby. you accepted that? mother: yes. mr schonell: and yet in the first year of your child’s life, you meet up with him two or three times? mother: in a public location. we met in cafes.[23]
dear [mr bergeron], i just wanted to write you a short note to apologise for my behaviour in the last six months, especially last time we spoke and for not getting back to you sooner. i wanted to let you know that i know i’ve been a bitch and i hope we can in time work things out to be friends and you can forgive me. please can you let me know what you want to do about [v] and how you are generally feeling about things. i am happy for you to see him if that’s what you want though it might be a bit hard for me at first so maybe you could meet with mum or [ms k] and [v]? what do you think? i understand if you do not want to see him and realise that it would probably be my fault. although it’s not really an excuse the reason i’ve been so off is because since [v] was about two months old till about a month ago i had post-natal depression and that joined with me still hurting from you wasn’t the best combination! yes i did love you and you telling me about [ms cl] and that you had been lying through our relationship hurt a lot especially as you hadn’t told me all of this when it was still possible for me to have an abortion. i do not think that was fair, maybe you did it on purpose, maybe not and you didn’t realise that it would have an impact on my decision, but it would have. i feel that i needed to say that to get it out in the open as i’ve been thinking about it for so long. if you want to see [v] we are going away at the end of may for the summer, but i will make time for him to see you before that if you want, maybe once you’ve seen him your mum would like to see her grandson? that is if she does not still resent him for being born. think about what i’ve said and mail me back. yours, [ms bergeron] x.[24]
reconciliation and life in the uk
... shouted at [v], smacked [v], shut [v] in his room for hours, and took toys from [v] and threw them in the bin.   bergeron] said that in regards to the facial wash he had told [v] that if he said a bad word that his mum threatened to wash his mouth out with soap and has never done this to [v]. in regards to [w] being force fed, she was ill with fu [sic] and lost her appetite and she was encouraging her to eat some cheese on toast and she was not sik [sic].   and [w]’s names [were] made subject to a child protection plan under the category of neglect.
this case was brought to an icpc after there were allegations of physical abuse against the children from their father [mr bergeron]. it was alleged that [v] had been hit several times and young [w] had been force fed until she was sick. this information had been given by the mother [redacted] the parents have adamantly denied these incidents and stated the professionals, including children’s services had mis interpreted [sic] the conversations held between mother and health.   bergeron] wanted to know where i was at all times.
...took care for my phone not to be onto silent. i changed the text message notification so it would alert me every minute until i read the message, to ensure i did not miss any messages from him. i kept this level of notification on my phone until around november 2018.
dr barnett: as i understand your case, nothing like making [v] drink mouthwash ever happened? father: so [v] did use mouthwash on his teeth, but he spat it out. it was just routinely every night. we had a children’s one. and [ms bergeron] and i did discuss the old method of washing a mouth out with soap at one point as well, but it didn’t actually happen. it was just a discussion we had.[28]
dr barnett: you were – on one occasion when he didn’t eat his dinner, you gave his dinner to the dog, [cs]? father: the dog would eat any leftovers. dr barnett: well, if you could listen to my question? father: sorry. dr barnett: on one occasion when he didn’t eat his dinner, you gave it to the dog? father: yes. so we would give uneaten dinners to the dog. so there’s at least one occasion where he has not finished his dinner and given it to the dog, yes. dr barnett: and you put [v] down at the dog’s dish and put his face into the dish, didn’t you? father: no. dr barnett: you made [v] eat some of that dog food. isn’t that right? father: no.[31]
dr barnett: ... and it’s true, is it not, that you would force food into [w]’s mouth? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: and that even if she vomited a little bit up, you would scoop it back up with the spoon and force it back into her mouth. isn’t that right? father: when she was very small, the baby’s – the food spills out of their mouth, and you collect it back up and put it back in. yes. but it’s not vomit. it’s like – they’re not keeping it all in their mouth.[32]
mr schonell: okay. because at paragraph 60, you say on the first night of [w]’s life, you woke up to find [mr bergeron] having intercourse with you, correct? mother: yes. mr schonell: and you say that wasn’t by consent? mother: i was asleep, so i was not able to consent. yes. mr schonell: right. and no doubt that was an extremely traumatic event for you? mother: i think at the time i was in shock. it didn’t feel traumatic at the time. i was just in shock. i froze. mr schonell: right. when did you – did you remember it afterwards? this wasn’t one of the events that you forgot about, this is something you’ve always remembered? mother: yes. mr schonell: because you don’t mention it in your affidavit of 10 january 2019, do you? mother: no. mr schonell: you don’t mention it in your affidavit of 27 march 2019, do you? mother: no. mr schonell: you don’t mention it in your affidavit of 25 november 2019, do you? mother: no. mr schonell: you don’t mention it in your affidavit of 31 january 2020, do you? mother: i have not mentioned it in any affidavits except for this one. mr schonell: right. you don’t - his honour: what – what was that? i didn’t get that. mr schonell: she hasn’t mentioned it in any affidavit. you don’t mention it in the facts? mother: no. no. you don’t mention it in the family report? mother: no. mr schonell: and you make no mention of being raped in the uk anywhere, do you? other than in your trial affidavit? mother: yes. mr schonell: you don’t mention it to social services in the uk, do you? mother: no. mr schonell: and indeed, you say you were truthful when you spoke to your doctors in the uk? mother: i wasn’t – didn’t always give them the full extent of the violence but yes, i was truthful to them. mr schonell: right. his honour: not – not disclosing something is not equated with not truthful. mr schonell: yes. his honour: it depends on what you were asked - mr schonell: absolutely. his honour: - or what you tell them you were going to reveal.[33]
following [w]’s birth, i visited [ms bergeron] on a weekly basis in 2010. on a number of occasions, i saw [mr bergeron] holding [w]’s jaw, forcing food into her mouth. on one occasion, i was concerned and said to [mr bergeron], “[mr bergeron]! can’t you see [w] is choking. that’s not the way to feed a baby”. [mr bergeron] said, “it’s okay. i know what i’m doing”. despite my comments, he continued to force feed her.
mr schonell: right. and then you say at paragraph 18 that following [w]’s birthday, on a number of occasions you saw “[mr bergeron] holding [w]’s jaw, forcing food into her mouth, and on one occasion i was concerned.”. so there was just the one occasion that you were concerned, correct? maternal grandmother: no, more than that, but - mr schonell: right? maternal grandmother: i’ve just reported one. mr schonell: i want to suggest that what [mr bergeron] was doing was that when he was feeding [w], as babies can do, that [w] was spitting food out and then [mr bergeron] was sort of shovelling it back in to feed her. do you agree with that? maternal grandmother: yes.[35]
had not seen [ms bergeron] for a few months when she came on the 17th may asking for medication to delay a period for a [country bs] holiday. she came back into the surgery on 27 june and told me that the [country bs] holiday was a honeymoon after her wedding to [mr bergeron].
she told me that she thought she was stronger as over the previous fortnight she had been able to stop [mr bergeron] hurting [v]. she also said that [v] had spilt something in the sink, and [mr bergeron] had said that he would make [v] drink facewash, although that had not actually happened. [ms bergeron] also said that [mr bergeron] was force feeding [w] until she vomited. she did not give me any details about when these incidents happened and if they had happened on multiple occasions. at that same appointment on 25 july, [ms bergeron] had a tubular bandage on her right lower arm. when i asked her what had happened she said that it was a burn which was six months old. when i asked her how the burn had been administered she said [mr bergeron] had held her arm against the hob. i had not remembered seeing the bandage on her arm at our previous appointments, although she could have been wearing a long sleeved shirt. [ms bergeron] said that with the recent hot weather her arm had been itching and she had scratched it and caused it to bleed which was why she was wearing a bandage. i did ask her if i could look under the bandage and she refused.
dr barnett: in 2011 you held my client’s arm on a warm hob. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: and it caused her to have burns on her arm. isn’t that right? father: i do not believe she has ever had burns on her arm. she has had scars from when she was self-harming on her arm. dr barnett: on 3 august 2011 a report is made with respect to you burning her arm, making [v] drink facial wash and force feeding [w] until she was sick. you’ve read that, haven’t you? father: there is that report, yes. dr barnett: and the reason my client told health-care workers that these things had happened was because they – that had actually – those things had actually happened. isn’t that right? father: now, that’s not correct. i believe there was another reason why she said that.
seen by [cu] yesterday and disclosed that father had hit [v]. [cu] has reported to children’s services and [ms bergeron] very distressed by this.
again, difficult but honest consultation. [mr bergeron] keeping an eye on her and checking on her as he found out about self-harming and this does stop her. suicidal thoughts not intrusive now and cutting makes them go away. has taken herself up to 40 milligrams citalopram too early, and aware that it will take a bit longer to kick in. slept last night for the first time. no appetite but [mr bergeron] making her eat once a day. social worker came fri and then yesterday and it looks like there will be no further action and it is clear that disclosure to s services has had a profound impact on [ms bergeron’s] ability to confide in helath [sic] professionals, which was not easy before.
bad week after i saw her last week ending up with her running away in her nightie and dressing gown on fri night, trying to get back to [city cw] where she has friends. [mr bergeron] discovered she was missing two hours after she had gone. she realised she didn’t have enough petrol to get to where she wanted so went to stay with a friend and then went home in the morning. she feels that [mr bergeron] realised that night that she would go and has been diff [sic] towards her since. lots cutting at end of last week but not since sat.
feels calmer, eating and drinking and sleep sl [sic] better. row before she left was about iud again but now both have a better understanding of what the issues are for both of them.
no mention that he took the iud out?
to which the mother responded
no.
mr schonell: no, and i would suggest to you, if it occurred, you would have said it to your doctor? mother: i suggest to you that i probably wouldn’t have said it to my doctor. mr schonell: so you’re happy to disclose domestic violence to your doctor, but you’re not happy to disclose that your partner took out your iud? mother: nowhere in this have i disclosed the full extent of the domestic violence to my doctor. mr schonell: ma’am, i want to suggest to you the reason why it’s not in these notes is because [mr bergeron] didn’t take it out, did he? mother: he did take it out.
dr barnett: now, in 2010 my client got an iud inserted. you’re aware of that? father: she had an iud at one point, yes. yes. dr barnett: and you wanted her to remove the iud. isn’t that right? father: no. dr barnett: you didn’t like the feel of it when you were having sexual intercourse with my client. isn’t that right? father: so i felt the iud, i think, only once in the time that we had sexual intercourse. dr barnett: and you wanted her to remove it. isn’t that right? father: i wanted [ms bergeron] to stay on contraception. i didn’t mind what contraception she chose. dr barnett: well, my client goes to the doctor on 2 december 2010 and says that you want her to have the iud out. do you recall reading that? father: i’ve read that, yes. yes. dr barnett: and the reason she went to [dr cx] on 2 december 2010 with this request is because you had asked her to have it removed. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: and then when the doctor indicated that removing it because of the wishes of her father was not something they would do, you got angry about that, didn’t you? father: i wasn’t aware of that, actually. dr barnett: you were certainly aware that she continued to have the iud? father: yes. sorry. i – i trusted when she said she had contraception, yes. dr barnett: you said to her, “i do not want that inside you. you will need to get it removed”. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: you told her, “just tell the doctor that it’s causing you pain, and then they will remove it”? father: she told me it was causing her pain and she wanted to get it removed. dr barnett: now, shortly after april 2010, my client was having a bath. she got out of the bath, and you asked her to sit on the bed and told her to lie down, and you commenced removing her pants and removed the coil. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: you pushed her down. you pushed down on her stomach while you removed the coil from inside her. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: she asked you to stop, but you didn’t acknowledge her. isn’t that right? father: that didn’t happen. dr barnett: you pulled out the iud, dropped it on to her stomach and said “there”, didn’t you? father: no.
when i visited in around early january 2011, after a new year’s visit to country cy with [mr bergeron], [ms bergeron] told me, “when we were in [country cy], [mr bergeron] held [v]’s head under the bathwater. he said he did it because he was misbehaving. i was horrified and frozen. i couldn’t speak. after [mr bergeron] did this, i went to the gp and the gp prescribed me antidepressants.” i was horrified, but failed to follow up on this as i should have done. i asked what i could do to help and [ms bergeron] told me not to worry. she would handle it.
mr schonell: right. and this was a period where you say you’re on holidays, [mr bergeron] comes into the bathroom with you and [v] and you say that he drowns [v] – he pushes [v]’s head under the water? mother: yes. mr schonell: yes. for a minute, i think you said? mother: slightly less than that, but yes. mr schonell: a bit less than that. and you say he stops moving? mother: yes. mr schonell: right. and then you say, though, notwithstanding the fact that he stopped moving, do you say he passed out? mother: no, he just stopped struggling. mr schonell: he stopped struggling. okay. so was he dead limp or...? mother: he stopped struggling.[37]
mr schonell: in your affidavit that you filed on 31 january 2020, at paragraph 26, you said you – he held his head under the water for around a minute? mother: yes. mr schonell: i suggest to you that if he had held his head under the water for around a minute, he probably would have been dead? mother: i – so i’ve said in one affidavit around 30 seconds. in the other one, around a minute. it’s actually – when you’re really traumatised, it’s actually difficult to have an accurate recollection of the amount of time. i have – i said approximately on both of those times. mr schonell: right, okay. so is it fair to say, when you’re traumatised – to recount what you just said – you do not have a good recollection of events? mother: i do not have a good recollection of the time, yes. mr schonell: of the time. what about events? mother: i – no. so there are patchy memories. bits are missing and i think that’s normal with traumatic memories. i get flashbacks and my memories are not always consistent. they do not – sorry, consistent is the wrong word. they do not run like a tv would. sometimes i get flashbacks of them. mr schonell: right. because as i’ve put to you at the beginning of your cross‑examination, your allegations have become more numerous as you’ve filed each affidavit, haven’t they? mother: yes. mr schonell: and they’ve become much more detailed as you’ve filed each affidavit, haven’t they? mother: as i have become further from the – the living with him and my memories have returned.[38]
dr barnett: whilst in [country cy] you got very angry at [v] when he was mucking up in the bath. do you accept that? father: no. dr barnett: you held [v] under the water because he was mucking up in the bath. isn’t that right? father: no. dr barnett: you held him for approximately 30 seconds as a form of discipline. isn’t that right? father: no.
one night in around [early] 2011, [mr bergeron] came downstairs where i was watching television and saw that i had cut myself, the razorblade was on a tissue next to me. he said, “you are not allowed to hurt yourself. you are mine, only i am allowed to hurt you”. [mr bergeron] grabbed the razorblade. he pushed me down on to the sofa, straddled me, pushed my chin up and cut my neck horizontally with the blade a number of times. once he left the room, i got my keys and phone and left the house. i drove to my friend [ms cz’s] house. i stayed with her, talking overnight, and returned home early the next morning.
she stayed with me to talk and drink tea until the early hours, then went home before the family got up.   ms bo did anything about the cut, (2) ms bo provided treatment, (3) ms bo made a report to anyone about what she had been told occurred, and (4) describes bleeding or anything of that nature.   ms bo provided treatment, (3) ms bo made a report to anyone about what she had been told occurred, and (4) describes bleeding or anything of that nature.   ms bo made a report to anyone about what she had been told occurred, and (4) describes bleeding or anything of that nature.   describes bleeding or anything of that nature.
dr barnett: now, my client commenced seeing – let me just get the reference – a counsellor from [town be] counselling service in early 2012? father: she – sorry, yes. she went to them for some sessions. yes. dr barnett: and you said to her, “i do not want you going. it won’t help you feel better. only i understand you. no one else does”? father: no, that’s not correct. dr barnett: you say you never said that you do not want her to go and see the counsellor? father: i was encouraging her to see a counsellor or a psychologist. dr barnett: because [ms bf] [the maternal grandmother] records a conversation had with you where you indicate that you think her going to see the counsellor makes things worse rather than better. do you recall saying those things to [ms bf]? father: i do not recall saying that. dr barnett: are you saying that you didn’t say those things? father: i was supportive of her going to see counsellors and psychologists. whether or not she was doing better or worse at the time, after she saw each one, maybe she was doing worse, but that was more likely related to her general mental health rather than seeing the psychologist or counsellor. dr barnett: well, the fact of the situation is that you told my client, “it’s making you worse. i won’t let you go.” isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct.  ] in june 2012, just before we left to move to australia, there was an incident where [mr bergeron] threw tea at my chest and burnt me. i have been very confused about the context of this previously. the reason for my confusion is [mr bergeron] (with my permission) requested for the garage where i purchased the tea to provide photographs from cctv of me purchasing the tea. i viewed these photographs and i have tried to piece together what happened. [mr bergeron] told me there was footage of me spilling tea on myself and i believed him. i assumed from the photo of me carrying two (2) cups of tea that i spilt one tea when i was reaching for [w]’s hand. but i cannot say with any certainty what occurred when i attended the garage. all i remember is my hands being hot. [82] i remember being out the front of my next door neighbours house and walking around the back of the car and handing [mr bergeron] the tea. [mr bergeron] said words to the effect of, “you're late.” he removed the plastic lid and threw the contents of his cup directly at me, towards my chest. he remained holding the cup. the liquid was very hot and i was badly burnt. my skin turned white with chunks of skin coming off in my hands. i was not in any pain, my skin was numb and i still experience numbness in this area of my chest. [83] i recall meeting the children's health visitor was at [sic] the entrance at the desk to the right. she told me where to go and a little while later sat with me. i told her i was in the early stages of pregnancy. the health visitor called the social worker, i think her name was [dr ce], who was allocated to us last time. [dr ce] arrived with the police and they to make a police statement and if they could take pictures for evidence, but apart from confirming [mr bergeron] had caused the burn and it was not an accident [sic]. i felt unable to let [mr bergeron] down. i can not recall if i let them take a picture of the burn. [dr ce] traveled back to my home with me to collect [w] and our overnight things. we were then driven to [ms cz's] house, where we stayed. at some point, [v] came to [ms cz's] house. during this time, i signed a working agreement saying i would separate from [mr bergeron] and not return to a relationship with him.  ] in or about june 2012, several days prior to our relocation to australia, [ms bergeron], [w], and i were all at the former family home in the uk packing our belongings. the home had almost entirely been packed into boxes and the storage/delivery workers were present. [ms bergeron] and [w] went across town to get some takeaway tea, as the kettle had already been packed away. [ms bergeron] telephoned me about 30 minutes or so later on the way to the hospital and told me words to the effect “i have spilt some tea on myself. i am going to the hospital to get the burns checked.” i understand that from the service station, [ms bergeron] attended the local emergency department. when she returned, she told me “i went to a& e and they said it will heal”. [64] about 30 minutes after [ms bergeron] arrived home, a plain clothed police officer and social worker attended the family home where i was present with the children. they said to me words to the effect “we have received a report that you caused your wife to be burned with some hot tea. you are not to be in the presence of your wife or the children”. i said “what’s going on?” [ms bergeron] told me she did not know what was going on, but to abide by the police’s orders, she took the children and went to stay with her friend for the next few nights. as the home was empty, i stayed with [ms bergeron’s] mum. [65] [ms bergeron’s] mother and i obtained cctv footage from the petrol station where [ms bergeron] purchased the tea. i was very concerned at the time as to false allegations being made against me. annexed hereto and marked “9” are copies of images i obtained from cctv at the service station through a freedom of information request. the images depict [ms bergeron] spilling the tea. i was not present at the shops and could not have caused the hot water to be split on [ms bergeron]. the allegations made against me were inconsistent and bizarre. [ms bergeron] denied she had made such allegations, but i later became aware from social services that [ms bergeron] had told a nurse at the emergency department that i had caused her to be burned and a mandatory report was made.  ] on 28 june 2012, i was at the [town be, united kingdom] property helping [ms bergeron] and [mr bergeron] with the children and final house cleaning before renting out [ms bergeron's] property. [ms bergeron] left [mr bergeron] and me in the house and took [w] with her to the local bp garage to get some takeaway tea. [mr bergeron] became agitated as time went by and when he heard the car draw up he went out to meet [ms bergeron] outside the house. he then came in with [w] saying [ms bergeron] had scalded her chest with the tea and had gone to the hospital. after around an hour, [ms bergeron] arrived at the house escorted by a police officer and a social worker. i said, “what's going on?” and the social worker said, “we have come to get the kids belongings and then will be leaving immediately.” while [ms bergeron] was collecting hers and the children’s items, i asked the police officer what was going on. the officer said, “[ms bergeron] is going away with the children for their own protection and [mr bergeron] should not contact her.” [mr bergeron] turned grey in the face and dropped to the floor. as there was no furniture in the house and [mr bergeron] did not want to stay with his mother as she had no idea about the allegations and social services involvement, i said, “[mr bergeron], you can stay at my house while you decide what to do.” over the next week, i could hear [mr bergeron] speaking with men’s right groups and a lawyer. after a few days of staying with me, [mr bergeron] said, “i'm going to go to australia alone in 2020. i have told [ms bergeron] to follow me later.”
there are serious concerns here that leaving action for the area office or cin team to pick this up this morning rather than last night by out of hours (and indeed the late/delayed referral made [redacted] may now mean that the family have left this area for [city cw]. we have no forwarding address for either [city cw] or australia where they intend to move to next thursday. actions: it has been agreed that [region da] cin team will undertake the joint visit with the police this morning and the case will be allocated to them.
we told [mr bergeron] that [ms bergeron] has been directed to move out of the relationship, he was not very shocked or angry about this statement, only blaming [ms bergeron] that she has mental health problems and that she had spilt her tea down herself yesterday at a garage. he said this could be proved by watching the cctv at the garage. i told [mr bergeron] there were other accusations and the department has a duty to protect the children. [mr bergeron] commented about the damage we had done previously with our involvement on cp plan. however, i added, although the case had closed, there were still underlying concerns that [ms bergeron] had told the truth and was too frightened to leave him, which [ms bergeron] had stated several times before [redactions]. [mr bergeron] commented to his mother-in-law that the trip to australia would not be happening. [redactions] [ms bergeron] collected [v] and his clothes and he said goodbye to his father.   bergeron] finally made the decision to leave [mr bergeron] and took the children with her, [redaction]. [mr bergeron] travelled on his own to australia in 2012.
mr schonell: and there was an incident when you were packing to relocate to australia. do you remember that incident? mother: not in a lot of detail, no. mr schonell: you agree with me that that incident has been recited in numerous different versions in various affidavits? mother: yes. mr schonell: right. and i would suggest to you that if you were telling the truth, that this would be a very significant assault upon you. do you agree with that? mother: it would be one of a number of assaults, yes. mr schonell: ma’am, please try and not volunteer evidence and just answer my question. mother: okay. mr schonell: the event of him throwing hot tea [on] you in a rage would be a significant assault on you, wouldn’t it? mother: yes. mr schonell: right. and it was a significant assault because after you reported this allegation to the police, you were required to sign a statement saying that you and [mr bergeron] would separate: correct? mother: i did not report the allegation to the police, but yes, i did have to sign a statement to say that we would separate. mr schonell: so i would suggest to you that details of that event would be crystal clear in your mind. do you agree with that? mother: they – [mr bergeron] told me a version of events which i believed. ... mr schonell: ... you are telling me that what [mr bergeron] told you about the event is what you accept as the truth? mother: yes. that is what i accepted. it was only ... mr schonell: so then why was it there – was a report being made if you accepted what [mr bergeron] said? because [mr bergeron] said there was no assault, didn’t he? mother: i went to the hospital. so i went to the hospital, the health visitor saw me and i told them that he had thrown tea at me. later on – i cannot remember, some days later – he told me that i had spilt it on myself and that there was evidence to prove that and i believed him. i have – i cannot explain why i believed him, but i did, and it was only when preparing this final affidavit, trying to work out what was my memories and what was his memories, that – and what i had been told and what was actually my memory, that i’ve written down my memory. his honour: what you’re telling me, if i have it right, is that from 2012 until july 2020, you believed the version that [mr bergeron] had told you, that you had spilt it on yourself? mother: yes. his honour: and then in mid-2020, in preparing your final affidavit, you recollected that he had thrown it at you? mother: i had always recollected it, but he had denied it and he told me that – i hurt myself with it. mr schonell: and do you accept that you provided extremely detailed descriptions of particular events in your affidavit? mother: yes. ... mr schonell: but you cannot remember an occasion when your husband threw hot tea on you and burned you so badly you couldn’t feel it? you couldn’t remember that in any details, could you? mother: i – i was told something different. i was told that there was video evidence to prove it. i believed what i was being told. mr schonell: you do not honestly say that, do you? mother: yes, i do. mr schonell: you do not make any reference to the tea event in your affidavit filed on 10 january ... 2019? mother: i do not recall if it’s in there. ... mr schonell: and you provided three different versions in three successive affidavits. do you agree with that? mother: yes. ... mr schonell: ... and you’ve said to his honour that you didn’t believe the version of events – that you believed [mr bergeron’s] version of events until you filed your affidavit in these proceedings, correct? mother: not until i filed the affidavits. there was some point between the last two affidavits when i was told to think more – think about it in more detail, and then i – and then i thought about what i actually knew, as opposed to what i had been told. mr schonell: and you say that to his honour? mother: yes. mr schonell: then why was it, on 12 december 2016, at a surgery consultation you said, when you saw [dr bu], husband arrested in the uk after throwing hot water on you? mother: i do not know. i do not recall that. mr schonell: firstly, [mr bergeron] was never arrested in the uk for throwing hot water on you, was he? mother: no, that’s true. mr schonell: so why did you mislead [dr bu]? mother: i would not have said he had been arrested. he has not been arrested. mr schonell: i will tender that note in a minute, your honour. and you would agree with me that note is entirely inconsistent with the story you just told his honour there? mother: yes, that note is not accurate. mr schonell: the note’s not accurate? mother: that note isn’t – i – i wouldn’t have said something which was inaccurate. mr schonell: well, i’m a little confused. so is your disclosure to your doctor incorrect, or is what you’re telling his honour incorrect? mother: i would have told my doctor that he had thrown hot tea at me. mr schonell: you just said to his honour you only just worked out the truth when you were drafting your affidavit for the final hearing? mother: i always believed that he had thrown hot tea at me, but he concocted this whole story about something differently. mr schonell: ma’am, you’re suggesting here that [mr bergeron] was arrested in the uk for throwing hot tea on you, and up until filing your affidavits in these proceedings, you thought it was an accident, because that has always been [mr bergeron’s] story? mother: i have never told anyone that he has been arrested. mr schonell: no, madam, you’re not answering my question. you said you had always accepted [mr bergeron’s] version because he told you, and he said that he had proof, up until these proceedings, correct? mother: in my head, he has always thrown a cup of tea at me. but also, in my head, he has told me something differently. his honour: so in your head, you accepted two different versions of the same event? mother: i do not know what i accepted. i knew that he had thrown tea at me – tea at me outside the house, but also, he’s telling me that i dropped it on myself and he has video recording to prove it. i didn’t know what was accurate and what was inaccurate.[39]
mr schonell: so your affidavit filed on 27 march 2019, at paragraph 28 of 74 – it’s page 28 of 74 in the filed version on the bottom of the document there. there are various paragraphs referencing that are very confusing by the solicitor that drafted at the time, but there is a (vi) is what i’m taking your honour to:
i find it very difficult to speak about. in june 2012, when preparing to leave for australia, i spilled tea on myself at a garage. i went home. [mr bergeron] became angry, as i was late. tea was spilled on me again during this argument and i was burned and went to the hospital. i was pregnant with [x]. at the hospital, the health advisor who had been involved in the previous social services case spoke to me. i cannot recall what i said at the hospital, but the hospital notified social services. i was required to sign a letter saying i would separate from [mr bergeron]. [mr bergeron] left first and came to australia. i went to [country de] with the children. [mr bergeron] contacted me many times during the time, saying things would be different, and i went to sydney with the children, feeling i had no option.
you do not make any comment here that [mr bergeron] threw tea on you, did you? mother: he spilt tea on me. that was in the affidavit. mr schonell: okay. i will read it again:
i spilt tea on myself at a garage. i went home. [mr bergeron] became angry as i was late. tea was spilled on me again during this argument and i was burned and went to hospital.
mother: okay. mr schonell: you do not say [mr bergeron] spilt tea on you, did you? mother: no. tea was spilt on me in an argument. mr schonell: right. but not by [mr bergeron], was it? mother: i’m sorry. i think i implied the argument was with [mr bergeron]. mr schonell: and then you filed another version of your affidavit on 31 march 2020. you say when you handed [mr bergeron] the cup, he threw the contents on your chest. again, that’s a completely different story to what you said in march 2019. do you agree with that? mother: yes. mr schonell: you said in march 2019: “tea was spilt on me again during this argument, and i was burned and went to hospital”. isn’t – that’s what you said? mother: okay. mr schonell: nothing about [mr bergeron] throwing it on you? mother: okay. mr schonell: nor can you remember what you said to the hospital staff. that’s what you said in the affidavit i read, correct? mother: okay. mr schonell: so you cannot even say, “well, i remember telling the hospital staff that [mr bergeron] threw it on me.” you didn’t say that, did you? mother: no, i did not say that. mr schonell: no. what made you change your address evidence?[40] mother: i think time, more time to – and actually, my lawyers. so i was – i was talking to them and they were saying, “what is your exact memory?” so i had written down what i had been told all the years, and my lawyer has asked for my exact memories, so i wrote down my exact memory.[41]
his honour: can i just ask whom did you first tell that [mr bergeron] had thrown tea on you? mother: i’m not sure. either the health worker at the hospital or the nurse at the hospital or the police when they arrived. one of those three. and then ... his honour: but why would the police arrive if you hadn’t told someone that someone else had burnt you, rather than you burning yourself? mother: the nurse looked at the – the way the burn was. so the burn was here, and then splattering out. and they said that there was no way that i could have done to myself, so they – the police were called. his honour: you didn’t put that in your affidavit, did you? mother: no. i was told it was hearsay.
mr schonell: how do you know? mother: i do not recall how i knew. i think i had been – she was due to be there. i think maybe [mr bergeron] had said she was there. i do not – i knew that she was in the house. mr schonell: she was due to be there. was that your answer? mother: i do not recall if there had been a text to say she had arrived, or i knew she was going to arrive, or if she was going to be there at a certain time. but i knew that she was going – that she was there.

the move to australia
my life in the uk is over. my home is rented out, everything i own is in transit and [cs] (her beloved dog) is in quarantine at the airport. the baby is due... [mr bergeron] thinks it’s best for us to go and join him.
... picked up the roomba hoover and threw it towards [y] on the changing mat. as he picked up the hoover, i leant forwards, so my body was covering hers. the hoover hit on my back. [y] was fine. [mr bergeron] said, ‘i told you to shut her up. i am trying to sleep’. i picked [y] up and carried her back upstairs to the room i shared with her.
on one occasion i came home from work to find [w] in tears. i said “what happened?” [w] said, “dad pulled me across the floor by my hair and i hit my head on the doorframe.” [w] cried and said, “it hurts.” i felt her head and she had a bump on her head.
in around the second half of 2015/early 2016, on one occasion [mr bergeron] hit me multiple times with his belt across my back, leaving bruising. later i saw in the mirror an imprint from the buckle. this happened in his bedroom. i remember him sliding the belt off his trousers while he stood over me. i was on the floor. i was in my work clothes. he was really angry at me and i remember him shouting and standing over me. i do not remember what he said or the reason behind it. my memories are really patchy around this incident. it was dark out, the light was on in the room, there were old clothes on the floor of the room.[51]
on another occasion, [mr bergeron] said as he walked towards me, “i will never kill you, remember that”. he then put his hands around my throat, cutting off my air. he held me against the wall by my neck for around a minute.
dr barnett: my client started working in 2015? father: yes, in 2015. i can’t remember the exact date, sorry. dr barnett: and that is when she was working at the [employer df]? father: yes. dr barnett: and you weren’t happy with her working. is that fair to say? father: i liked her working. dr barnett: on one occasion you pulled [w] across the floor by her hair. she hit her head on the door frame. didn’t you? father: no. dr barnett: you’ve read that my client reports that that’s what [w] has told her? father: i – i might have read that. i will take your word it’s in the affidavit. there were a lot of allegations in there. dr barnett: and, as i understand your evidence, you say that the most physical chastisement that you’ve given to [w] is a smack on the bottom. is that right? father: yes. dr barnett: and so does that mean you’ve never done any other types of physical discipline to her? father: i’ve definitely picked her up if she has been in the wrong place or pulled out of the way if she’s in a dangerous situation, but i wouldn’t necessarily classify that as discipline. dr barnett: and during the relationship, that is, before separation, do you think [w] was scared of you? father: no.[52]
referred by gp (not regular gp) for review of mood. gp had concerns regarding dv after observing bruising to both forearms. [ms bergeron] denied this to gp but did ask if it was okay for her father to have sex with her when she does not want to. children currently in the care of the father.[55]
... all the children had been present, [v] and [w] had been watching us the whole time.
dr barnett: the fact is, is that you had unconsensual sex with my client because you didn’t care about her mental health, isn’t that right? father: it’s not correct. dr barnett: now, on one occasion, you came home from work whilst my client was in the kitchen preparing pudding for the kids, you came up behind her and pressed her into the countertop and kissed her neck, she didn’t respond. do you recall this incident that i’m speaking about? father: i may have come home when she was making pudding and given her a kiss, that’s possible, yes. dr barnett: on this occasion, you then slid your hand under her top and caressed her breast. that happened, didn’t it? father: no, that wouldn’t have happened. dr barnett: the kids were there and she pushed your hand away and said no. that happened, didn’t it? father: that didn’t happen, no. dr barnett: at 109, your honour, of my client’s affidavit. you grabbed my client’s hands and pulled them behind her back so that they were twisted with her wrists together in one of your hands, isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: you then put your knees between – sorry, your knee in between the kitchen side and her and pulled her slightly away while pushing at her back, isn’t that right? father: no. dr you slid your hand around her, between her legs, pushed her underwear aside and put your fingers inside of her, isn’t that right? father: no. dr barnett: and the only reason you were able to do this is because you were holding her arms at an odd angle? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: she started to cry, didn’t she? father: no. dr barnett: after five to six minutes, you let go of her arms and my client was still crying, isn’t that right? father: that didn’t happen.[56]
on one occasion in 2015, [mr bergeron] had been angry at us, yelling and had out of anger had lashed out and pushed [w] over on to the floor.
dr barnett: on one occasion in 2015, my client didn’t come home for the night and she had the children in her care, isn’t that right? father: she has taken holidays and gone to see people, so possibly she has gone out in 2015 and not come home. dr barnett: well, on this occasion she didn’t tell you where she was going? father: no, there’s no occasion where she has gone overnight away and i don’t know where she is or what the high level plan is at least. dr barnett: on this occasion you were angry, you were yelling and you lashed out and pushed [w] over onto the floor. did you ever push [w] onto the floor? father: no. dr barnett: my client left with the kids and you called her and made further threats, isn’t that right? father: i’ve never called [ms bergeron] to make threats. dr barnett: she went and stayed the night at a local church hall with the children. you recall that happening? father: i don’t know if she has ever stayed at the church hall. i don’t think so. dr barnett: well, sir, that would be something you would recall, isn’t it? father: yes, so my – my assumption is no. yes. dr barnett: and the reason you can’t recall is because you’re just blanket denying that this incident occurred, even though it did occur, isn’t that right? father: the incident did not occur.[57]
she said that her mother has been crying after she has been hurt by him and this makes [w] feel sad and she does not know what to do.  9] [w] said that on one occasion, she would run into the bathroom to hide from her father, she locked herself in the wardrobe, her father threw her into her bedroom and locked her in her room until her mother got home. she said that this happened when she was seven years old. [w] said that on another occasion, her father was “really grumpy at me”, he threw a glass cup, it shattered on the floor, she stepped on it, and hurt her foot. she said that this happened when she was eight years old.  2] [w] said that...when she [[w]] gets into trouble from her father, her father “gets angry, he starts hurting...”
dr barnett: [w] records to the family consultant that she remembers on one occasion – this is paragraph 119 of the family report:
on one occasion she would run into the bathroom to hide from her father. she locked herself in the wardrobe, and her father threw her into the bedroom and locked her in the room until her mother got home.
do you recall reading that? father: yes. i assume it’s in there. yes. dr barnett: and what do you say? do you say that you ever locked her in her room? father: i’ve never locked her in her room, no. dr barnett: do you say that – sorry, i withdraw that. and you threw her into her bedroom from time to time? father: i’ve never thrown her into her bedroom, no. dr barnett: she also recalls at paragraph 119 that she recalls that you were really grumpy at her and you threw a glass cup and it shattered on the floor? father: i’ve never thrown a glass cup at anyone. there has been times where we dropped glasses on the floor. dr barnett: that she stepped on it and she hurt her foot? father: she did step on a glass after she hurt her foot – after it has been dropped on the floor, but it wasn’t thrown at her. dr barnett: [w] also recalls that she remembers an occasion when you slammed the door on [y]’s face and then that you said it was an accident. do you recall reading that? father: i recall reading it, yes. dr barnett: you did that, didn’t you? you slammed a door and it hit [y]? father: i’ve never slammed a door in [y]’s face, no. dr barnett: [w] also says that you have punched her, kicked her and thrown her? father: i’ve never punched or kicked her. we have done, like, throwing in the air games and those sorts of things in the pool. dr barnett: so you’re saying to this court that the things that [w] records about you are false? father: in that part of the family report, yes. elsewhere maybe not. dr barnett: and you would say to his honour that there’s absolutely no basis for these matters at paragraph 118 and 119, other than the fact that a glass did break and she did step on it, there’s no basis for her to fear you. is that right? father: that’s right, yes.[58]   on too many occasions to recall the individual incidences, i have observed [ms bergeron] coming into work shaking and distressed with visible injuries, such as multiple bruises to her arms or legs. sometimes they were large, there was one on her left leg which lasted for around two months which took up the lower half of her thigh, covered most of the front of her leg while wearing shorts. she never told me how she got this bruise other than that it was caused by [mr bergeron]. other times the bruises were smaller, fingertip or fist sized. [ms bergeron] once showed me bruising on her back which was formed the shape of a belt, with an imprint of the belt buckle part of the bruise. [4] i have observed [ms bergeron] finding it very difficult to walk between the office due to the injuries she sustained which were not visible while clothed. she would limp up the hill and i formed the view she was in pain. she would cling on to the railing for support while gingerly taking the steps down to the yard. [5] i have seen bruising around her neck 5-7 times, which she would cover while at work using scarfs, but she would remove the scarfs if we got together after work or if i asked her to.
... continuing papptern [sic] of domestic violence at home both verbally when hsb has been drinking as over xmas and physically although she would not let me expose her abdomen when examining today, hints at injury”
and again during a consultation on 20 march 2017:
... agrees to have morphology scan but refuses to expose her abdomen today saying she ‘injured herself’ a few weeks ago, not deliberately. when asked if this was caused by partner she said only ‘it was a misunderstanding’
and again during a consultation on 5 may 2017, “refused abdominal exam” and, “urged to photograph and send me photos of any future physical injuries”.
... on many nights. by the time i was to travel, i had two black eyes and had heavy bruising over my back, sides, stomach and arms. i had bruises on my legs”.
she came to work for me at [employer df] in 2015 and worked both saturday and sundays during term times until she went on maternity leave in 2017.  6] ... i remember his hands around my neck and i struggled to breathe and was rasping for air. when he pushed me on to his bed i tried to get up and leave the room, but he pushed me back down and struck my face with his hand a number of times. i remember him pulling me by my arm across the floor in the lounge and stamping on my chest.

when she agreed she was very scared of what was going to happen as she did not want [mr bergeron] to get into trouble and she was petrified of what [mr bergeron] would do to her if he found out she had gone to seek medical help.  ] ... where domestic violence occurs in a family it frequently occurs in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage, and possibly their children. we cannot accept that a court could never make a positive finding that such violence occurred without there being corroborative evidence from a third party or a document or an admission. we have not been referred to any authority in support of such a proposition. [80] in the subject case there is an underlying unstated submission by the appellant that in relation to the alleged rapes by the father of the mother she had available to her the avenue to complain to the police and/or subject herself to medical examination. that clearly did not take place at the time of the alleged incidents. [81] the victims of domestic violence do not have to complain to the authorities or subject themselves to medical examinations, which may provide corroborative evidence of some fact, to have their evidence of assault accepted. clearly if they do so it is evidence which may assist the court in determining an allegation.
dr barnett: on 24 june 2016 you sexually assaulted my client. what do you say to that? father: i’ve never sexually assaulted [ms bergeron]. dr barnett: you put your hands around her neck, and she was struggling to breathe. isn’t that right? father: i’ve never strangled [ms bergeron]. dr barnett: you pushed her on to the bed, and when she tried to get up to leave the room you pushed her back and struck her face. father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: you’ve pulled her by her arm across the floor. father: no. i’ve never done that. dr barnett: and my client had injuries because of this assault. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. ... dr barnett: and you did have an argument with my client about her and the children going back to the uk without her on 25 or 24 june 2016? father: that’s not correct. we didn’t argue, and i was more concerned that she would be well enough to travel. dr barnett: now, my client had bruising to her upper and lower arms and a black eye, didn’t she? father: i wasn’t aware of the bruising on her arms. she may have had a bruise on her eye, but i do not remember it. dr barnett: and the reason why she had bruising on her arms and around her eye is because of the assault that you’ve perpetrated on her. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: so are you saying to his honour that you do not – you said she may have had a bruise around her eye. isn’t that right? father: at the time she was very tired and had dark eyes. i do not recall – i do not have a memory of her having a bruise. she definitely wouldn’t have had, like, a full black eye but could have had a small bruise around her eye without me noticing.[68]
dr barnett: sir, on your copy can you see arms – can you see my client’s arms that are bruised? father: so i’ve got the black and white one, but i have seen the coloured one, and i can – the coloured one shows it more clearly. yes. dr barnett: and you accept that on both arms on her forearms there is a significant number of bruises. father: yes. dr barnett: and that on her upper arms there is some bruises as well. father: yes. it looks like that. dr barnett: and the reason she has bruises on 30 june 2016 once she is in the uk is because of this assault that you’ve perpetrated on her. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct.[69]
mr schonell: and you agree with me that [mr bergeron], while you were in the uk, was in frequent contact with you? mother: yes. mr schonell: pardon me. you would send him photos. mother: i do not recall, but i might have. mr schonell: do you remember him sending you a photo – or you sending him a photo of you at the airport terminal in your stopover on the way to the uk of you and the children? mother: i do not recall it, but i think i’ve seen it somewhere, yes. mr schonell: right. mother: i do recall the picture. mr schonell: right. so you do not doubt the veracity of that photo, do you? mother: no. mr schonell: no. right. and you would agree you’ve seen that photo, you would agree with me that you do not have a black eye in that photo, do you? mother: i’m wearing heavy makeup in the picture.[71]
mr schonell: i see. and you would agree with me that if you had been abused, it would be very odd for you to be sending a photo to [mr bergeron] in the layover on the way to the united kingdom. do you agree with that? mother: no, i don’t. mr schonell: do you say you were in fear of him when he committed these – this abuse towards you? mother: i say that i just wanted to get to the uk. i have – i was really relieved to be past that checkpoint in the airport. i was – it felt – everything felt lighter. i do not recall what i was thinking at the time. mr schonell: must have been a massive weight to be away from him. mother: it was a massive relief to get past that point where he couldn’t change his mind... mr schonell: yes. and you were so distressed by that event that when you got to [country do] or [country dp] or wherever it was on your stopover, you asked somebody to take a photo of you and the children, and then you messaged it to [mr bergeron], correct? mother: i do not know. i do not recall who took the picture. mr schonell: i didn’t ask that question. mother: okay. mr schonell: somebody took the photo, didn’t they? mother: i presume so. mr schonell: do you think that’s inconsistent with the fact that he had been, for a number of days, abusing you, raping you twice? mother: no. i do everything possible to keep him calm and happy. mr schonell: but he’s not there with you. you’re on the way to [city cp], you’re on the way to [the united kingdom] to see your family? mother: yes. and he’s due to join me, and i know that i will be returning to australia with him after that. my job is to keep him happy so that he does not get angry. mr schonell: so you sending this message was to placate him because you were worried about him. mother: i am – yes. mr schonell: you do not say anything in your affidavit about this, do you? mother: i do not think so. mr schonell: all right. and you sent [mr bergeron] a few messages saying you missed him, didn’t you? mother: yes. mr schonell: do you think that’s again inconsistent with somebody who has just been raped on two occasions in the prior few days and had been physically abused? mother: no. i think it’s me trying to keep him calm and happy and placate him.[73]

[mr bergeron] moved up, over my body, straddling me and wrapped his left hand into my hair, grabbing a handful and pulled me upwards towards him. he re-adjusted my hair in the grip of his left hand then sat up and rammed my head sidewards into the wall of the bedroom really hard. i had pain shoot through my left ear and the top bit of the head above the ear. with his left hand still wrapped in my hair his right hand pulled down his boxer shorts, then pushed my legs apart and he pushed himself inside me, it felt very uncomfortable. i said ‘no’. i tried to push him off me, but i couldn't and he continued having sex with me. the entire time he had his left hand wrapped in my hair, holding me to the bed. i remember staring up at the crack between the wall and the architrave where the paint had not reached and following the cobwebs on the ceiling with my eyes.

dr barnett: now, the next year – so we’re going ahead closer to the date of separation, my client tells you that [z] – there’s concern regarding [z] and the amount of weight she’s putting on. do you recall my client telling you that? father: that’s right. yes. dr barnett: and my client tells you that [dr bu] made a paediatrician appointment for [z] to go to. do you recall my client telling you that? father: i recall [z] had a paediatrician appointment. yes. dr barnett: you didn’t want my client to take [z] to the doctor, did you? father: i like [ms bergeron] taking the kids to the doctor. yes. i do want them to go. dr barnett: sorry. you did want her to go? father: yes, i did want her then to go to the doctor. yes. dr barnett: because my client says that – she said, “i would like to take her to the appointment. the gp booked her in as an urgent referral.” and you said, “you are not allowed to take her out of the house.” that’s what happened, isn’t it? father: that is not correct. dr barnett: you say that you want her to take her to the paediatrician. is that right? father: i would prefer the kids to attend doctors than not. yes. dr barnett: but on this particular occasion, is it your evidence to the court that you wanted her to go to the paediatrician? father: so it would have been better if [z] had gone. [ms bergeron] said she wasn’t up to going. dr barnett: can you please answer my question, sir? father: sorry. dr barnett: are you saying to his honour on this occasion you wanted [z] to go to the paediatrician? father: i think it would have been best if she had gone. yes. dr barnett: so your answer is yes? father: sorry. yes. yes. dr barnett: you wanted her to go? father: yes. yes. dr barnett: and why didn’t you take her? father: so [ms bergeron] said she wasn’t up to going. dr barnett: why did you not take [z] yourself to see the paediatrician? father: because they wanted to see the mother as well, to talk about breastfeeding and weight gain. it’s not much help if i go by myself. dr barnett: so are you saying that there was no benefit to [z] in going to see the paediatrician without [ms bergeron] going along with you? father: not to talk to about breastfeeding. i do not know what i would say about her breastfeeding. dr barnett: well, the very fact that [ms bergeron] didn’t feel - on your evidence - well enough to go and see the paediatrician, isn’t that an indication that you would have concern regarding her capacity to care for the children? father: when [ms bergeron] is unwell, she does not like to see people. so she can still look after the children at home and get drop-offs done and things without seeing external healthcare providers. so no, she can look after the kids.[98] ... dr barnett: and, in those circumstances, you are saying to this court that you made the decision not to take [z] to the paediatrician yourself? father: yes. we rescheduled. yes. dr barnett: and really, if you were being protective of [z], you would have taken her to the paediatrician appointment, wouldn’t you? father: no, because if they’re going to have a conversation about breastfeeding, it wouldn’t be very helpful for [z]. so [z] was gaining weight still, and i believe that’s normal for breastfed babies not to gain as fast as bottle-fed. so i didn’t think there was any real issue with [z] at the time.[99] ... dr barnett: now, one of the reasons that the department of family and community services became involved was because of [z] not seeing that paediatrician. do you accept that? father: that’s my understanding. yes.[100]   bergeron] reports that there has been consistent domestic violence perpetrated by [mr bergeron] towards her, and she recognised it as serious when he began yelling at the children. ... the report dated 31 october 2017, was in relation to past domestic violence, however, there were no immediate concerns for the children’s safety or wellbeing. ...

as we talk, she makes it clear that she wants nothing to do with [mr bergeron], and she actually never wants to see him again, but is unable to achieve that because he is the father of her children, and he has power and control over her. states that she is unable to get him to respect her boundaries of personal space and when she says “no” describes him as coming on a sunday when he knows [ed] is not there, arrives early morning and stays till 10.30 at night, and she can’t make him leave. ... states she capitulates to sex because she knows he will not stop.[113] acknowledges is she is very fearful of [mr bergeron] and as we explore her fear she sees herself curled up in a ball, screaming. after a long reflective silence, she states that she suspects her behaviour with [mr bergeron], her inability to hold her boundary to get away from him, her inability to maintain emotional separation, relates to her csa.
acknowledged that is likely and an important link to make. discussion re csa. describes herself as a little girl alone with the tradesman who was working in her home. for several days, she had been enjoying herself, helping him work whilst parents were at work. then, one day, he said words to the effect “if you go and get that for me from over there, i will show you something”, and the abuse started. holds herself responsible for the abuse, as she did as she was asked and collected the object for him. discussion re the fact that she was only a young child, and he was the adult with the authority power, and that he had been grooming her so that she liked and trusted him. discussion re what she thinks made her vulnerable to his attention. having a cold mother who hated her and was vindictive in her disgust with her she was never the sort of child her mother had hoped for and was told this many times having a father who was always supposedly ill and was always talking about the fact that he was going to die. this behaviour was present right from childhood, made her fearful and destroyed any possibility of a close father-daughter relationship, even though she was closer to him than her mother. has difficulty letting go of the belief she was responsible for the csa.
it is an agreed fact that the parties had sex post separation five to six times.[115]

mr schonell: because you would agree with me that your affidavit is absolutely silent on what happened with the children for the period from separation up to 25 august 2018. do you agree with that? mother: i – i do not know if there is anything in there, but i will accept that there – yes. there is definitely not a lot, if there is anything. mr schonell: well, you separate from [mr bergeron] in december 2017. correct? mother: yes. mr schonell: the children spent regular and frequent time with him over that period? mother: yes. mr schonell: and you do not say anything that, for example, [x] was reluctant to spend time with his dad. do you agree with that? mother: he was reluctant mr schonell: no. i’m not- mother: but no, it’s not said. mr schonell: that’s not the question i’m asking, madam. mother: sorry. mr schonell: i’m not asking you to add to your evidence. you do not say anywhere in your affidavit that [x] was reluctant to spend time with his dad from separation until august 2018, do you? mother: no. i do not say that. mr schonell: and you do not have any evidence in your affidavit that [w] was reluctant to spend time with her dad from separation until august 2018, do you? mother: no. mr schonell: and you do not say anywhere in your affidavit that [y] was reluctant to spend time with her dad between separation and august 2018, do you? mother: no. i do not give the details. mr schonell: pardon? mother: no. i do not give the details. mr schonell: not one line. mother: that’s a mistake of mine. i’m sorry. mr schonell: not one line to suggest the children do not want to see their dad. correct? mother: correct. i’m sorry. mr schonell: because the truth is, they wanted to see their dad. correct? mother: yes. they did enjoy spending time with him at times. mr schonell: and the truth is, they were not in fear of him. mother: no. that’s not true. there were times when the children refused to go. mr schonell: madam, i’m not asking you to expand upon your evidence. i’m merely asking the question- mother: sorry. could you repeat the question? mr schonell: you do not say anywhere in your affidavit that they were in fear of him during that period, do you? mother: no. i do not. mr schonell: right. you do not say anywhere in your affidavit that they were anxious about spending time with him during that period, do you? mother: no.[117]
the incident on 25 august 2018  [z] was an infant at the time, and (2) [x]’s vision was directed away from the father, and he only felt the contact between himself and the father.   [x]’s vision was directed away from the father, and he only felt the contact between himself and the father.  7] at or about 2.30 pm [on 25 august 2019], [x] was sitting on the leather sofa waiting to play a game on my phone. i had a notification on my phone for a new post on reddit and quickly read it. whilst i was reading the post, [x] came over to me and jumped onto my lap. he put his head between my face and the phone. i said to [x], “wait a minute,” and gently moved him out of the way. [x] then jumped back onto my lap from the edge of the sofa. i gave him a hug using my right arm around his shoulders. when i was finishing reading the last paragraph, [x] asked to be let go. i let go of him, moving my arm out of the way. he got up and quickly lost balance. as i tried to catch him and cushion his fall, the side of [x]’s head collided with my hand as i tried to stop the fall. i failed to hold his weight, and he ended up on the floor. he cried for a minute or so, and i consoled him with a cuddle. he then went for a nap. when he woke up from his nap, he seemed fine. [108] it was common for [x] to play around with me, and jump on my lap. [109] i returned [z] and [x] that evening to [ms bergeron] and collected the other children. i informed [ms bergeron] what had happened with [x]. when discussing the matter with [ms bergeron], she did not question my explanation. it was common for [x] to play around with both [ms bergeron] and i during the relationship.
sorry for contributing to stressing you out earlier, hope you’re okay. by the way, [x] has a bang on the side of his head from when we were roughhousing earlier.   about 8pm on friday 24th august 2018 [mr bergeron] attended my address and collected [x] and [z] as per the custody agreement. they then returned to his address in [suburb dz]. about 6pm on saturday 25th august 2018 both [x] and [z] were returned to my home address. [6] while standing in the kitchen cooking, i received a text message from [mr bergeron]’s [sic] mobile (...) at 6:14pm that evening. [mr bergeron] mobile phone number [sic] is registered to him. the message said, “sorry for contributing to stressing you out earlier. hope you are okay! btw [x] has a bang on the side of his head from when we were roughhousing earlier.” i did not reply to the text. [7] i then walked into the lounge room and checked on [x]. i observed a bruise to his right cheek. the bruise went from his ear to his eye, approximately 5-7 cm diameter and was bright red in colour. i also observed a lump (egg) to the back of the right side of his head. the lump was slightly larger than a 50-cent piece. i leant over and attempted to touch the bump (egg). [x] has flinched and moved away, not allowing me to touch the bump. i said: “how did you get this?” [x] said: “daddy did it.” [8] i went and grabbed my mobile phone. i activated the video and started recording a conversation with [x] at 6.30pm. i said: “tell me again?” [x] said: “daddy was strangling around my neck, and i tried to get out because it way too tight.” i said: “then what happened?” [x] said: “i couldn’t breathe.” i said: “what happened after that?” [x] said: “he kept on like pinching and harder then . [sic] he hitted [sic] me hard. i got upset. while [z] was having a nap. like when we were doing it. then he hit me hard.” [9] i turned the video off after 41 seconds. i observed [x] getting emotional and started to cry talking about what occurred. i leant over and gave him a cuddle. [x] said: “i was biting and scratching at daddy’s arm. daddy wouldn’t let me go. i could not breathe.” i said: “that must have been really scary.” [x] said: “yeah it was scary.” [10] about an hour later, i had another conversation with [x]. [x] said: “daddy was on his phone ignoring me. i climbed on him. daddy pushed me away. i kept climbing on daddy, and he pushed me away.”[118]  ] i saw that [x] (who was in preschool) had a bruise and a welt to the right-hand side of his face, near his right eye. the bruise was about the size of a 50-cent piece. [13] i asked [ms bergeron] about what had happened to [x]. [ms bergeron] told me that [mr bergeron] told her that “a bit of roughhousing” had gone one [sic]. i encouraged her to tell me more details about what had happened, and [ms bergeron] stated that she had a video on her mobile phone. [14] i told [ms bergeron] that anything that she showed me i would have to report to facs. [ms bergeron], as a result, did not show me the video on her mobile phone. [ms bergeron] asked me to talk to [x] about what had happened. [15] asked [ms bergeron] if she was injured. [ms bergeron] said to me that she was not. [16] on tuesday 28th august, in the morning around 10:00am, at school s & preschool, i spoke to [x] about the bruising to the right side of his face. [x] said: “dad was hugging me too tight. i pinched him so he would stop. he let me go and hit me.” [17] i observed that the bruise and welt to the right-hand side of his face, near his right eye, had reduced swelling. [x] did not complain about the bruise and welt. [x] said: “it’s healing.” [18] as a result, i reported the incident to facs. the reference number of the report is ....[119]

so i tried to grab hold of him with my right hand, and he has kind of hit the leg area, but didn’t get a purchase there, and i also tried to grab his head with my left hand, and there was some – there is definitely contact there, and he ended up on the floor, but i didn’t get a – i didn’t get a strong enough grip that i managed to stop him from actually ending up on the floor.
q: he slipped off your lap in a rolling motion, he was on your lap, he was physically on the lap at the time he fell, according to your evidence. so is it the case that you reached out to try and catch him by putting your hand underneath his head? a: i just very quickly tried to grab him because he was going outwards from my point of view, so he’s going further away from me, so i was trying to reach and grab him very quickly.[122]

this turns to the application itself for an apprehended domestic violence order. the sole basis was the events that resulted in charges being laid against the accused, and no further evidence is relied on which indicates, at least to me, as to whether there is still a fear held by the child, and/or the mother, or indeed the siblings, and it would seem to me, in view of the findings of fact, that in relation to this matter, i am not satisfied that an order is warranted and the application similarly will be dismissed.[124]   [x]’s various statements as reported direct from [x] – his police interview and evidence in court, (2) [x]’s various statements as reported by others to whom he has asserted to have made statements – the mother and ms ek, [x] was on his father’s lap and fell away from his father’s lap toward the floor and felt his father’s hand hit him on the right-hand side of his face, resulting thereafter in a red mark with some bruising.

dr barnett: you were looking at a new post from reddit and you wanted to read it, is that right? father: that’s right, yes. dr barnett: you say that [x] came over and jumped on your lap? father: that’s right. dr barnett: that he put his head between your face and the phone and you asked him to wait a moment? father: yes. dr barnett: now, you pushed [x], at that point, away from you. isn’t that right? father: put him gently back on the ground, yes. dr barnett: sorry, you pulled him, did you say? father: sorry. i moved him back off my – he was sort of – he was coming from my right side over, and i put him back onto the ground, just to be clear. dr barnett: and so you say that you removed him with your hand, is that right? father: that’s right, yes. dr barnett: and where did you touch him when you were moving him with your hand? father: so i held him by his shoulders to move him back onto the ground. dr barnett: you then say that he came back onto your lap? father: that’s right, yes. dr barnett: you gave him a hug using your right arm around the shoulder? father: yes. yes. dr barnett: and you did that because you wanted to continue reading the reddit article, is that right? father: that was because he – when he jumps onto – into my lap, i catch him, so it was part of a normal game we play when he jumps onto me. i grabbed him, let go or push him back, and he would jump onto me again. dr barnett: well, answering my question, do you say that you put your hand and – sorry – your arm around [x]? father: i did, yes. dr barnett: how long do you say that you – sorry, and did you – do you say that you held him with your arm? father: yes. dr barnett: and how long do you say you held him for? father: a short period of time – 10 to 15 seconds, that kind of range. dr barnett: and where do you say your arm was touching his body? father: so my arm was over him and i was touching his shoulder and his back, or the top of the shoulder blades, you might call it. dr barnett: [x], in his jirt interview – this is at page 104 says, “daddy strangled his arm around my neck”. it’s true, is not it, that your arm around him wasn’t around his shoulder but around his neck, isn’t that right? father: that’s not true. dr barnett: whilst you were holding him, he was indicating to you that he wanted to be let go, isn’t that right? father: no, not at the time. dr barnett: he keeps on pinching and hitting you, trying to get out of the hold you have on him, isn’t that right? father: no, he didn’t do that. ... dr barnett: so [x], in the video recorded by my client, indicates that you were strangling him around his neck, as well as to the police in the jirt interview also says that you were strangling him around the neck, isn’t that right? father: i believe that’s correct, yes. dr barnett: and the reason that he says both of things is because that is indeed what happened – that is, your arm was around his neck and you were strangling him, isn’t that right? father: i haven’t strangled [x]. dr barnett: now, whilst you were holding him, he becomes upset and he is trying to get out of your grasp, isn’t that right? father: no. dr barnett: you retaliated in anger and you hit him, isn’t that right? father: i did hit him, but accidentally. i was trying to catch him. dr barnett: he says – and this is at page 104 of the tender bundle, that you hit him hard and the bruise came. you accept that as a result of your action he got a bruise? father: that’s right, yes. ... dr barnett: that’s what happened, is not it? while your arm is around his neck, he’s trying to pinch you because you were holding him too tight? father: that’s not correct. dr barnett: you then hit him hard, didn’t you? father: it was hard enough to cause a bruise. it was accidental, though. dr barnett: [x] says, “super hard. super hard.” you read that, didn’t you? father: i have read that, yes. dr barnett: and he says, “well, this one, and he hitted me there indicating his right temple with an open palm”. that’s where you hit him, isn’t it, that right, on his head? father: that’s ..... yes, that’s right. dr barnett: and you did it with an open palm? father: it was when i was trying to catch him – open palm, yes. dr barnett: and you did it intentionally, isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct.[127]
mr schonell: because you would agree with me that your affidavit is absolutely silent on what happened with the children from the period from separation until 25 august 2018. do you agree with that? mother: i – i do not know if there is anything in there, but i will accept that there – yes. mr schonell: right? mother: there is definitely not a lot, if there is anything. mr schonell: well, you separate from [mr bergeron] in december 2017. correct? mother: yes. mr schonell: the children spend regular and frequent time with him over that period? mother: yes. mr schonell: and you don’t say anywhere that, for example, [x] was reluctant to spend time with his dad. do you agree with that? mother: he was reluctant - mr schonell: no. i’m not – mother: but no, it’s not said. mr schonell: that’s not the question i’m asking, madam? mother: sorry. mr schonell: i’m not asking you to add to your evidence. you don’t say anywhere in your affidavit that [x] was reluctant to spend time with his dad from separation until august 2018, do you? mother: no. i do not say that. mr schonell: and you don’t have any evidence in your affidavit that [w] was reluctant to spend time with her dad from separation until august 2018, do you? mother: no. mr schonell: you don’t say anywhere in your affidavit that [y] was reluctant to spend time with her dad between separation and august 2018, do you? mother: no. i do not give the details. mr schonell: pardon? mother: no. i do not give the details. mr schonell: not one line? mother: that’s a mistake of mine. i’m sorry. mr schonell: not one line to suggest that the children didn’t want to see their dad. correct? mother: correct. i’m sorry. mr schonell: because the truth is, they wanted to see their dad. correct? mother: yes. they did enjoy spending time with him at times. mr schonell: and the truth is, they were not in fear of him? mother: no. that’s not true. there were times when the children refused to go. mr schonell: madam, i’m not asking you to expand upon your evidence. i’m merely asking the question? mother: sorry. could you repeat the question? mr schonell: you do not say anywhere in your affidavit that they were in fear of him during that period, do you? mother: no. i do not. mr schonell: right. you do not say anywhere in your affidavit that they were anxious about spending time with him during that period, do you? mother: no. ... mr schonell: ... then, on 25 august, you say that [x] returned to your care with facial injuries, including an egg-like bruise on his head. correct? mother: correct. mr schonell: and you say [x] described being strangled and hit by [mr bergeron]. correct? mother: yes. mr schonell: you didn’t take him to the police, did you? mother: no. mr schonell: no. you didn’t report it to facs, did you? mother: no. mr schonell: because you thought nothing of it, did you? mother: i was massively concerned, but i was still in the mindset where i was protecting [mr bergeron]. i didn’t know what to do, so i took him to see [ms m] to ask her advice. ... mr schonell: the only reason facs became involved was because [x] had disclosed to his teacher at his school that [mr bergeron] had put his arm around his neck and then struck him, causing significant bruising. correct? correct? mother: i’m just trying to think. sorry. i believe – yes. facs became involved because school were going to inform them. mr schonell: right. not because of anything you did? mother: no. mr schonell: despite you discovering the bruises on 25 august 2018, on 26 august 2018, things proceeded as normal, didn’t they? mother: i asked mr bergeron to come and help put the children to bed. when he arrived, [x] freaked out and hid behind me and i asked him to leave. mr schonell: you and [mr bergeron] ate dinner together that night. correct? mother: no. he ordered dinner. he ordered a take-away, and i believe he went to pick it up and then he took it home with him. mr schonell: i want to suggest to you, you got take-away and you ate it together. correct? mother: no. [x] hid behind me and was scared of his father, so i asked him to leave. mr schonell: do you say that in your affidavit anywhere? mother: no. mr schonell: right. pretty important fact, do not you think? mother: no. mr schonell: no. and i want to suggest to you that on sunday 26 august, that is the day after [x] had returned to you with facial injuries, or the bump on his head, [mr bergeron] also assisted you with the children. correct? mother: no. i asked him to, but having seen [x]’s reaction, he left straight away. mr schonell: well ..... mother: [x] freaked out when his dad arrived. mr schonell: and i suggest the only reason you asked him to was because you thought nothing of the fact that your son had a bump on his head. correct? mother: no. it’s because i hoped that [x] telling me his father had strangled him, that there had been some kind of misunderstanding, i hoped. however, seeing [x]’s reaction to his father being in the house, i realised that [x] was really, really scared of his dad. he wouldn’t let him anywhere near him and he was hiding behind me for protection. mr schonell: do you say any of that in your affidavit? mother: no. mr schonell: because you’ve just made it up, haven’t you? mother: no. mr schonell: because [mr bergeron] actually stayed and did the hair washes. correct? mother: no. mr schonell: and he put the children to bed? mother: no. incorrect.
...knelt down to [x] and explained to him that we could do that, but if he wished to stay when we arrived, that would be okay too, and i would be completely guided by him. [x] appeared content with this and agreed to let [ms el] or myself know if he wished to return to [ms bergeron] who would be waiting in the park. [128]
... i then encouraged [x] to go to where [mr bergeron] was to get sun cream, and [x] ran over to everyone, and [mr bergeron] assisted [x] with applying sunscreen. ... [x] came over and said, “up,” to [mr bergeron], and [mr bergeron] picked [x] up. [x] appeared very happy. [x] asked [mr bergeron] if they could play. [mr bergeron] walked with [x] to a dolphin seesaw ... when the children finished playing on the seesaw, [x] said to [mr bergeron] that he would like to go on the flying fox. i carried [z] and followed [w], [x], [y] and [mr bergeron] to the flying fox. [y] and [x] held [mr bergeron]’s [sic] hands as they walked.
... [x] said to [mr bergeron], “daddy, can you go on it?” [mr bergeron] went to have a go on the swing, and [w], [x] and [y] enjoyed watching [mr bergeron] on the swing and smiled and laughed.   and [x] gave [mr bergeron] a hug goodbye and a kiss. [w] gave [mr bergeron] a tight hug. we all walked to the entrance of the playground. [x] said, “bye bye, daddy, lift me,” and [mr bergeron] lifted him into his arms and gave him a hug.   shouted from the van that, ‘i am not going to see daddy as he hurt me. [sic] [mr bergeron] said she had a doctor’s note which said: ‘i can’t let [x] attend as he tried to stab two of his siblings over the past two weeks’.[129]   and i walked to the complex entrance and she pointed to [mr bergeron] and ran the short distance over to give him a hug. [mr bergeron] picked [w] up, kissed her, and wished her a happy birthday ... [mr bergeron] asked [w] if she had been well since the last time he saw her. [w] said yes and she told him about sport camp ... [mr bergeron] told [w] he would like to take her out for dinner, [w] seemed pleased and we walked to a restaurant in the complex and sat down. [mr bergeron] gave [w] a birthday gift and she excitedly asked to open, and [mr bergeron] agreed and [w] unwrapped the gift. she received a make-your-own-keyring set, and [w] thanked her father and gave him a hug ... [mr bergeron] asked [w] if she wanted to play a game. [w] excitedly agreed and asked [mr bergeron] what he had brought, and he said [game em]... when [w] had finished eating, [mr bergeron] paid and we walked through the complex. [w] walked in front of [w], but put her hand out behind her and [mr bergeron] held it ... after the game, [mr bergeron] and [w] packed up and [w] asked [mr bergeron] for a piggyback. he helped [w] onto his back and we walked to the car. [w] and [mr bergeron] discussed when they would each other again [sic] and what they would do together ... at the car, [w] hugged [mr bergeron] and then he gave her a kiss on the head and a hug ... [w] walked to the side of the car with the booster seat and then returned to [mr bergeron], and he said goodbye, and [w] again walked back and they hugged again. [mr bergeron] said he would miss her and [w] said she would see him soon, and secured herself in the booster seat. we arrived at [mr bergeron’s] residence just before 8pm. i parked and we exited the car. [mr bergeron] walked to my car and gave [w] a hug. [mr bergeron] asked how her ‘date’ was and [w] happily talked about what they ate and did at the visit.[130]
dr barnett: you would accept the proposition at post-separation, all five of them never spent time with you all together overnight? father: they did. dr barnett: and how frequently do you say that happened? father: it only happened twice post-separation. so when we went to [city ee], that was one trip, and then when [ms bergeron] went away, i looked after them for a weekend. dr barnett: and i take it that both of those occasions were prior to august 2018? father: yes. yes.[131]   the parties were conducting face-to-face handovers of the children (2) the parties went on a holiday together with the children for between 10 days to two weeks (3) the father was spending time with the children in the mother’s home (4) the father and the mother were eating meals together (5) the parties corresponded by text message in a civil fashion   the parties went on a holiday together with the children for between 10 days to two weeks (3) the father was spending time with the children in the mother’s home (4) the father and the mother were eating meals together (5) the parties corresponded by text message in a civil fashion   the father was spending time with the children in the mother’s home (4) the father and the mother were eating meals together (5) the parties corresponded by text message in a civil fashion   the father and the mother were eating meals together (5) the parties corresponded by text message in a civil fashion   the parties corresponded by text message in a civil fashion
time spent by the father with the children  has, at times, not wanted to go and see her father. at other times, she has wanted to stay longer with him.
while they were eating, [y] asked [mr bergeron], “do you remember when you hurt my neck?” and [mr bergeron] said, “when?” and [y] said, “when i was at your place.” [mr bergeron] asked if her neck was okay, and [y] said yes. [y] continued eating and the conversation stopped.[132]
on 15 july 2019, [y] and i were sitting together, and [y] said to me words to the effect of, “i remember daddy hitting me. i remember him putting his hands around my neck like this.” after saying this, [y] physically put her two hands around her neck and squeezed. [y] then said, “it hurt me. he used to hurt me but he does not any more, there are helpers to keep me safe.” after [y] had finished speaking, i said to her, “thank you for sharing this with me.”
on 10 may 2020, [y] was in the bath with [w]. [w] brought [y] out in towels while i was in the kitchen, cooking. [w] looked upset, and said to [y], “tell mum what you said – what you just told me.” [y] said words to the effect of, “daddy put his hands around my neck and squeezed it hard and it hurt me.” [w] then said to me, “[y] is telling me that daddy strangled her at night time when she was at his house. when i asked her when this was, she told me it was before she went to the contact.” i then observed [y] stretching her hands out and putting them around [w]’s neck.
despite all of this, from what i can tell, i think [y] enjoys her visits with her dad.
she said that her father lives elsewhere because “daddy can hurt us, he can do anything to hurt us, he always hurts me, he can do anything to hurt”. she said that her mother has not hurt her and that “she’s going to keep me safe from daddy”. [y] did not want to talk about “troubles” any further. she reported she would like to see her father on the day of interviews and she likes to eat with her father and mother.[133]
in my opinion, in the best interest of mast [x] [bergeron], it’s better not see his father at this stage, it affects his level of stress (and also he could be risk for other kids considering what he did after seeing his father last time as per his mother’s report) till he get assessment and help by a psychologist.   the father spend time with [y] and [z], supervised by bl contact centre each alternate saturday from 12:00pm until 3:00pm at suburb e playground or suburb f play centre, or at the café/playground at suburb f or such other place as may be agreed between the parties, starting 4 may 2019, (2) the father spend time with [w] supervised by bl contact centre each alternate sunday from 3:00pm until 6:00pm at suburb d shopping centre or such other place as agreed between the parties, the first occasion to be sunday 5 may 2019, bl contact centre undertaking all changeovers at the start and end of the father’s time, (3) an order was made for [x] to attend to spend time with his father during the occasions the father was spending time with [y] and [z], or in accordance with his wishes, (4) it was noted that the father indicated to his counsel his agreement to that order relating to [x], (5) a further notation was made that [v] was 15 years of age and would make his own arrangements in relation to spending time with his father should he wish to do so.   the father spend time with [w] supervised by bl contact centre each alternate sunday from 3:00pm until 6:00pm at suburb d shopping centre or such other place as agreed between the parties, the first occasion to be sunday 5 may 2019, bl contact centre undertaking all changeovers at the start and end of the father’s time, (3) an order was made for [x] to attend to spend time with his father during the occasions the father was spending time with [y] and [z], or in accordance with his wishes, (4) it was noted that the father indicated to his counsel his agreement to that order relating to [x], (5) a further notation was made that [v] was 15 years of age and would make his own arrangements in relation to spending time with his father should he wish to do so.   an order was made for [x] to attend to spend time with his father during the occasions the father was spending time with [y] and [z], or in accordance with his wishes, (4) it was noted that the father indicated to his counsel his agreement to that order relating to [x], (5) a further notation was made that [v] was 15 years of age and would make his own arrangements in relation to spending time with his father should he wish to do so.   it was noted that the father indicated to his counsel his agreement to that order relating to [x], (5) a further notation was made that [v] was 15 years of age and would make his own arrangements in relation to spending time with his father should he wish to do so.   a further notation was made that [v] was 15 years of age and would make his own arrangements in relation to spending time with his father should he wish to do so.
mr schonell: and you would agree with me that, in the almost two years of [bl contact centre] reports, there is not one issue raised about [mr bergeron’s] conduct towards his children, do you agree with that? mother: i – yes. mr schonell: nor his ability to care for the children, do you agree with that? mother: yes. mr schonell: there is no suggestion he has ever lost his temper, do you agree with that? mother: yes. mr schonell: he has never hit the children, correct? mother: during the visits: yes. mr schonell: does that give you some comfort? mother: no. he is able to act for three hours a fortnight, it’s not difficult. mr schonell: ma’am, what i’m struggling to work out is: how is it that now you say he’s not a suitable dad to look after his children, yet, when you separated, you were quite happy for him to spend time with the children unsupervised? mother: when we separated, i was just hopeful that things would be different. i think the – what happened to [x] – and then [y] later reporting that he also strangled her – proved to me that things actually weren’t different, i just wasn’t seeing it. so he was still hurting the children, but i wasn’t around to witness it or to hear it firsthand from them.[134]   shouted from the van that, “i’m not going to see daddy as he hurt me.”
... asked why she did not want to attend, she said she didn’t know, didn’t want to make the decision and cried.   thought about this for a while and then asked to speak to her mum alone.   and [y] continued to chase each other around and when [x] realised that [y] had one of his toys, he tried to snatch it back and when she ran off, he chased her and smacked her a few times. ... ... [ms bergeron] repeated to [x] that this was not acceptable behaviour. [x] responded by getting upset and trying to smack his mum who repeated, “we don’t hurt other people.”... [x] realised [y] had his toy and he screamed and tried to hit her, and i picked [y] up and out of harm’s [sic] way and [x] returned to inside the vehicle, cried and shouted ‘no my toy’. [x] screamed and continued to try to kick [w]. [v], who had been sitting in the front passenger seat, sought to help. [v] said to [x], who was crying and yelling no, [x] you can get out now, i’m taking you out because you do not get to kick anyone, and [x] continued to scream, and [ms bergeron] then became emotional. ... [x] seemed to calm down somewhat after [v] spoke to him, and [v] gave [x] the toy [x] was looking for.
... [w] approached her father and cried, and she told him she wasn’t sure whether to stay or go and [mr bergeron] said she could do whatever she wanted and either was okay. [w] deliberated and said she didn’t know what to do and wanted someone to make the choice for her. [ms k] and i [the workers from [bl contact centre]] reflected on her options and ultimately encouraged her to do what felt right for her. after 5-6 minutes [w] decided to return to her mum and she tearfully kissed her dad goodbye. i said goodbye to everyone and walked with [w] to [ms bergeron]. when [w] saw [ms bergeron], she ran to her and cried even more. [ms bergeron] held [w] close and said, “i’m so proud of you for going up and saying hello.” ...
... asked [w] if she would like to quickly say goodbye to [mr bergeron]. [w] said she would like to, and [w] then said to me that [x] would like to as well. i told [x] that would be great. [w] and then [x] exited the car, and [ms bergeron] approached me stating that [x] had asked her if he had to go. i looked at [x] and told him he did not have to go if he did not want to, and i thought he had asked to. [x] then returned to the car as [w] and i walked across the park. upon seeing [mr bergeron], [w] ran into his arms and they hugged for a few minutes. [w] told [mr bergeron] that she would probably come to the next visit. [w] hugged [mr bergeron] one more time and we walked back to the car.[135]
24 february 2019
after a minute, [w] jumped out of the car and whispered to her mum as i was chatting to [y]. [ms bergeron] said [w] wanted to tell me something, and i walked over to her and asked her what it was. [w] said she meant to say that she wanted to come with me to say hi to her dad, but she didn’t want to stay for the entire time. i asked whether she was sure, and she said yes, and she also asked why we were at this venue and not at [suburb j play centre]. ...   said she would be happy to meet up with her dad at other venues, not a kid’s playground, and [mr bergeron] said he would look into it. they kissed and hugged goodbye and [ms k] walked [w] back to [ms bergeron].
10 march 2019
... [w] initiated conversation with me, she said she did not want to attend the contact but would only do so because she did not want [mr bergeron] to get angry with her. [w] seemed in something of an ambivalent mood, she occasionally smiled when she spoke but also appeared to show some level of apprehension.
we arrived at the door together and [w] greeted [mr bergeron] and put her arms around him, and [mr bergeron] said hi, and asked her how she was, and she said “good”. [mr bergeron] asked her if she would like to do something different like bowling or a movie, and he said would you prefer just the two of us and she said yes. [mr bergeron] said okay, we will organise that and let’s do that and he took three of the disney letters from his pocket and said he got them from coles and [w] could give one to [y] and [x] if you are collecting them. [w] said thanks and said okay, i’ll go now and he kissed her head and he said goodbye to [w] and [z] and thanked me, and we exchanged goodbyes. i carried [z] and [w] walked with me and we proceeded to the van. as we walked, [w] said, “now i feel bad as i told him i would go and i do not want to go.” i asked [w] why she didn’t want to go and she said, “because i feel angry, and i feel angry when i am with him, and i do not want to be like him.”
19 may 2019 – [w] alone
i tried to encourage [w] once again and she said she did not want to and she refused to leave the car. [ms bergeron] reinforced to me that [w] did not want to attend. i asked [ms bergeron] if she was going to cancel the visit, and [ms bergeron] told me it was not her call to cancel, and it was mine. [w] was determined not to attend and she refused to leave the car, so the visit was cancelled.[136]
2 june 2019 – [w] alone  said i do not want to go and i am not going. i told [w] that i would be there to look after her and i can join in with the [activities], and it will be fun. [w] said it wasn’t that she didn’t want to go, it was that she didn’t want to be with him, he frightens her and she does not like him. [w] reiterated that she liked [activities] and does not like her father. [ms bergeron] said, “but he is your dad and i want you to have a relationship with him.” at this point, i noticed that [ms bergeron] appeared to be reading this from the notebook she was holding. i also observed that [ms bergeron] was holding her phone turned upside down, and i considered that she may be recording the conversation. ... i said i thought she should try and give it a go, and [w] said she went the first time, didn’t like it and why would she want to go with someone who needs guards. ... [w] again said, “i’m not going”, and [ms bergeron] once again looked at her notebook, and she said to [w], “i need you to go to your dad, he is the only dad you have got.” and [w] said, “no, i do not want to.”

ms bm, the father’s sister
shortly prior to their relocation to australia, [mr bergeron] approached me and said to me words to the effect “social services think i have burned [ms bergeron] with hot tea. she spilt tea on herself leaving the service station. [ms bergeron] told me that she did not say this to them, but that they had come to their own conclusion ...”  ] throughout this trip in 2016, i did not observe [ms bergeron] to display any fear of [mr bergeron] or any upset towards him. she displayed assertiveness and was rather “bossy” toward him and the children.

ms m, the mother’s friend, for the mother
... [m]: what happened when you came back from swimming? [x]: daddy sat down on the couch and was reading things on his phone. [m]: what did you do? [x]: i wanted to see what he was reading. [m]: what did daddy do? [x]: he strangled me. [m]: can you show me how he did that? [x] was unwilling to demonstrate on me but willing to do so on his mum, so he sat beside her and then pulled her arm around his neck so that his neck was in the crook of her arm. [m]: what happened then? [x]: daddy tightened his hold around my neck? [m]: what did you do? [x]: i struggled to get free, i hit and i bit. [m]: what happened then? [x]: daddy let go. daddy punched me in the face. you can see the mark here. ([x] showed me the mark on his cheek)
ms bn, the mother’s friend and neighbour ] between 2016 and 2017, on approximately 5 or 6 occasions, when i was sitting at our dining room table by the front window of our house in the morning, i saw [ms bergeron] standing or retreating to the back corner of the van parked in her driveway. on each occasion, she was still wearing her nightie, was stooped over, and leaning on the back corner of the van. each time she stayed there for several minutes. she looked distressed and frightened. i was surprised and concerned by this but didn’t talk to her about it at the time.
ms bo, the mother’s friend in the uk ] in or around early 2011, i saw [ms bergeron] pull up in my driveway at around 12 am. she was in a distressed state and said she had been driving around. she had bleeding superficial cuts on her neck and told me that [mr bergeron] had been angry with her for self-harming and that [mr bergeron] had pinned her down and cut her with a razor on her neck. she stayed with me to talk and drink tea until the early hours, and then went home before the family got up.  ] in or around july 2018, i sent [ms bergeron] a text message which read, “is [mr bergeron] still spending time standing outside your home”. she said, “that has stopped, but he still gets angry and violent towards me when he comes over ....”
ms n, the mother’s employer
mr schonell: and it’s fair to say you’re very much aligned with [ms bergeron] in that you hold a very poor view of my client. do you agree with that? [ms n]: i have not met him many times. i have mostly seen [ms bergeron]. mr schonell: right. so really, when you think about your view of my client, it’s based upon whatever you have been told by [ms bergeron]? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: right. and including when you say that my client was controlling, again, that’s based upon what – what the mother has told you? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: did she tell you she suffered from mental health issues? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: did she tell you she had self-harmed? [ms n]: no. mr schonell: did she tell you she had been hospitalised due to her mental health issues? [ms n]: i do not remember. mr schonell: did she tell you she was medicated for her mental health issues? [ms n]: yes. ... mr schonell: right. okay. now, when one reads your affidavit, you would agree with me it comes from that document that you held concerns for [ms bergeron]? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: and were your concerns that [mr bergeron] may hurt her? [ms n]: and the children. mr schonell: and the children. you don’t say that in your affidavit? [ms n]: no, but most – like, [mr bergeron] was – mr schonell: well, that’s a very – [ms n]: [mr bergeron] was hurting her, yes. i don’t doubt that. mr schonell: so, hang on. you just said, “and the children”. so you held concerns that the children may be hurt by [mr bergeron]? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: and you held that when you swore your affidavit? [ms n]: yes. but it was- mr schonell: and you didn’t mention it in your affidavit? [ms n]: it’s basically for her and the children. mr schonell: and you didn’t mention it in your affidavit, did you? [ms n]: no, not at all. mr schonell: and, indeed, do you say you held the concerns in june of 2016, ma’am? [ms n]: pardon me? mr schonell: did you hold the concerns in june of 2016? [ms n]: that’s when i took her to hospital, yes. mr schonell: right. but you held concerns for the children then? [ms n]: only badly when she started telling me what had been going on. mr schonell: right. are you telling his honour the truth? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: why didn’t you put it in your affidavit? [ms n]: look, i probably should have put more in there about the children. mr schonell: more in there about the children? [ms n]: but the main concern was about [ms bergeron]. ... mr schonell: ... i want to read you the following text message between [ms bergeron] and the father on 12 october 2015. [ms bergeron says]:
hey, my legs are really hurting. could you go home to help with bedtime? [v] has done dinner. it’s hurting lots to walk.
and then she puts a frowning emoji. [mr bergeron] then in response:
okay. we’ll leave in a min. book a doctor’s appointment?   bergeron] responds:
i do not get why they are so sore.
frown. [mr bergeron] responds:
hence the doctor’s appointment.
... you would agree to me that he is inviting her to see a doctor, isn’t he? [ms n]: i guess so. mr schonell: right. and you would agree with me that her legs hurting would explain why you may have seen her “limp up the hill” as you suggest in paragraph 4 of your affidavit. do you agree with that? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: it might explain that, mightn’t it? [ms n]: quite possibly.[138]
mr schonell: okay. so you agree with me that in early 2016, you made some inquiries as to whether or not she held permanent residency? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: and that was true, wasn’t it? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: and indeed – so you knew he had no hold over her – and by that, i mean he couldn’t make her return to the united kingdom due to her residency status. do you agree with that? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: right. early 2016? [ms n]: yes.[139]   bergeron] has just told me that i do not have pr and would need to leave au within 48 hours if we separate. he was laughing at me. please help :(
mr schonell: and then we also know there was the event in june 2016 in which you take her to hospital? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: okay. did she ever say to you that she bruised easily? [ms n]: no. mr schonell: or that she experienced iron deficiency? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: she did say that? [ms n]: yes. mr schonell: right. okay. and – so you really do not know whether or not any of the markings that were on her were as a consequence of anything done by my client, do you? [ms n]: handprints and belt buckles. his honour: well, what counsel is putting to you is that your knowledge of how the mother came by these marks is based upon what she told you, not upon you seeing something actually occur? [ms n]: as if – as if ... his honour: you may have seen what the mother asserted was the result of something, but she told you how it got there, and that’s your only knowledge how it got there, is not it? [ms n]: have you ever seen an abuser bash someone in front of another person? his honour: no. that’s your only knowledge of how many marks came to be on the mother, is not it? [ms n]: correct. yes, your honour.[140]
mr schonell: so at this stage [as at june 2016], you’ve known her for two and a half years, from 2014 to now mid-2016. do you agree with that? [ms n]: on a – on a fairly casual basis, yes. mr schonell: well, no. she started working for you in 2015? [ms n]: right. so she would sit in the office all day, both days, yes. mr schonell: right. but she had been working for about 18 months? [ms n]: yes. ... mr schonell: now, you would agree with me, when you went to [g hospital], they emphasised that you should call them or the police if there were any further episodes of violence. do you agree with that? [ms n]: correct. mr schonell: right. but you didn’t call the police, did you? [ms n]: no. mr schonell: so you come in here to his honour saying, “i was terribly concerned about my friend because she had come in injured”- [ms n]: my friend told me that she- mr schonell: stop for a second. she had come in injured? [ms n]: mmm. mr schonell: and you were in tears about it, but you weren’t so concerned that you didn’t call the police? [ms n]: she told me that if i called the police, he would kill her. mr schonell: right. do you say that in your affidavit? [ms n]: no.[141]
ms bf, the maternal grandmother
during 2010, i noticed [ms bergeron]’s mood decline, and she had an increasing number of injuries, including burns on her arms, which she covered up with bandages and said it was her eczema flaring up.   bergeron] says he won’t sponsor me for my citizenship, and he will get me deported and keep the children if i try to leave him. i feel trapped. i do not know what to do.
... do a visa check online and found out that she held permanent residency and that this was not sponsored by or dependent on [mr bergeron] in any way, that she held it in her own right.
... in 2003, and when [ms bergeron] refused to go with him to the appointment, he pushed her down the steep stairs in her flat in [city br].
mr schonell: right. and at paragraph 9, you say [mr bergeron] had booked her in for an abortion in the clinic? maternal grandmother: yes. mr schonell: and, again, was that something you had recorded in your diary? maternal grandmother: i was working backwards. i think – i hadn’t – i didn’t write the word abortion. ... mr schonell: and then you say when [ms bergeron] refused to go with him to the appointment, he pushed her down the stairs in her flat in [city br]? maternal grandmother: mmm. mr schonell: i take it that wasn’t something you witnessed? maternal grandmother: no. mr schonell: right. so is this something that [ms bergeron] has told you? maternal grandmother: yes. mr schonell: right. when did she tell you that? maternal grandmother: i do not recall. i didn’t know the reason they had split up. mr schonell: okay. so extrapolating off that, you probably therefore didn’t know that this event occurred, because otherwise you would possibly tie those two things together? maternal grandmother: i would. mr schonell: yes? maternal grandmother: yes. mr schonell: yes? maternal grandmother: absolutely. mr schonell: so if it wasn’t when it occurred, can you put any more parentheses around where you think that range of dates might have been where you first found out? were they still in england? maternal grandmother: i actually do not know. if i had known that, i wouldn’t have encouraged her to go, to marry [mr bergeron], any of those things. mr schonell: that must have been quite a concerning thing for you to hear? maternal grandmother: devastating. mr schonell: devastating. you cannot think about where you were? was she – were you on the telephone when she told you this? maternal grandmother: i’m really – i’m just – sorry. i cannot help you.[142]
and the truth of the matter is that you informed [mr bergeron] that [v] was his son, correct?
i told him that his child had been born, yes.
...saw [mr bergeron] holding [w]’s jaw, forcing food into her mouth. on one occasion, i was concerned and said to [mr bergeron], “[mr bergeron], cannot you see [w] is choking. that’s not the way to feed a baby.” [mr bergeron] said, “it’s okay. i know what i’m doing.” despite my comments, he continued to force-feed her.
i want to suggest that what [mr bergeron] was doing was that when he was feeding [w], as babies can do, that [w] was spitting food out and then [mr bergeron] was sort of shovelling it back in to feed her. do you agree with that?
yes.
so even at that point, you would accept that you didn’t have any concerns that he had assaulted or scalded your daughter?  ] ... at this moment, i fully understood what [ms bergeron] had never explicitly told me, that she was the victim of domestic violence and i had been mistaken when i ignored social services’ warnings in 2012. i felt a wave of horror pass through me. i felt so sad for [ms bergeron] and angry with myself, wondering how i missed all the warning signs.
mr schonell: this is when she comes out and visits you? maternal grandmother: when she comes to the uk? mr schonell: yes? maternal grandmother: yes. mr schonell: when she comes and visits you and she says – she sends you a text which says: “do not be alarmed. i have a black eye as i walked into a door.” maternal grandmother: yes. mr schonell: right. you would agree with me that when she wrote she didn’t have a black eye? maternal grandmother: what i noticed was the bruises. mr schonell: on the arms? maternal grandmother: the faded black eye. yes. mr schonell: yes. so absolutely there was bruising on the arms, but you would agree with me that there was no black eye? maternal grandmother: yes. i didn’t see much of a black eye. mr schonell: well, no. you didn’t see a black eye? maternal grandmother: yes. it was faded. that’s – yes. mr schonell: well, i want to suggest to you there was no black eye? maternal grandmother: well, i didn’t see it.

the father’s interview with the expert ] ... after initial reluctance, he agreed to attend this course because he reflected that if he were to shout at the children now, it would be traumatic to them in a way that it was not before. [mr bergeron] thinks it is important to apologise to [x] for hurting him, otherwise [x] would view him as not accepting his feelings.
the mother’s interview with the expert ] ... she had difficulty in giving a straight answer to questions, and there were inconsistencies in [ms bergeron’s] narrative in the course of the interview process. there was no evidence of a formal thought disorder. her affect varied over the course of the three days of interviews ranging from visible distress when recounting some aspects of reported violence, to overwhelm when the children were present, to bright and reactive on the third day of the interview process to recount further details of the impact of the alleged violence she encountered.  ] when she was eight or nine years old, she was sexually abused by a man who was redecorating the family home for six weeks, as her parents had left her alone with him. the alleged perpetrator had threatened her that if she disclosed that this would kill her father. the alleged perpetrator died when she was approximately 14 years old and [ms bergeron] remembers feeling angry at the time as she was preparing to report the abuse. she did not go on to report it and feels at peace with her decision. [mr bergeron] was the first person she told about the sexual abuse and she told her mother when she was 21 years old.  ] ... described experiencing current intrusive symptoms which include distressing memories, flashbacks, distress or psychological reaction to cues that symbolised aspects of alleged violence by [mr bergeron]: negative alterations in cognitions and moods such as poor recall, distorted cognitions, fear, shame, and guilt.  ] ... she said, “no, yes, i have an underlying fear of [mr bergeron], not acute, i am petrified after court finishes he will want revenge”.  ] [ms bergeron] reported that [mr bergeron] “gets into people’s faces when he screams”. she was asked to recall what [mr bergeron] says when he screams. [ms bergeron] reported that “it depends” and it is “just lots of small things”. [ms bergeron] was asked about why [w] fears her father. [ms bergeron] reported that “it is a build-up of little things over the years”, “i do not know, i do not know if it’s a conscious thought”. [ms bergeron] said that she has asked [w] and that [w] gets defensive. she noted that [w] has wet herself on two occasions this year and wants to take her to a doctor but that [w] is too embarrassed to go. [at this time [w] was nine years of age]. [ms bergeron] went on to report that [mr bergeron] has force fed [w], sworn at her, hit her on the face, arm, body, and back with an open hand and that these events have occurred “always”. [ms bergeron] said that [w] has not sustained any injuries as a result and noted that [mr bergeron] has been “kindest to her [[w]]”.  ] ... the mother reported “that [v] would be angry, [x] and [w] would feel scared and that [y] and [z] would be happy if orders were made for time with their father.” the mother then said that she “does not know how she would make them go to see their father because they are so reluctant and that she is not going to physically force them because they feel scared.” the mother then reported “that she wants the children to have a relationship with their father and she wants a way to be found where the children are safe in his care and that they want to spend time with their father.”
[v]’s interview with the expert ] ... he described waiting for his father to come home from work to see “what mood he would be in”. he said that his father was typically stressed from work and had a “short span of where he could cope with things. [100] ... in australia ... his father was absent a lot, but when he was present, he was “good or bad” and that he would be “annoyed” and that he would hit whoever he was annoyed at. [v] said that his father would hit them with his hand, though clarified that “i do not think he ever went boom and pop a punch”. he reported that he does not remember specifically what his father would do, he does not like to think about it, and that things improved post separation. [101] [v] reported being unable to remember what his parents’ relationship was like prior to separation. he said that his parents separated because “they needed room” and noted that it was meant to be a temporary separation.  3] upon parental separation, [v] reported that he was visiting once a fortnight which he described as “good”. ... since court has started, however, he has not been to any of the contact visits as he does not want to see his father in a supervised manner as it is “fake”. [104] [v] reported that he does not want to see his father because “i do not want to move back in my life”. he reported that he is happier now as he does not have his father constantly dictating to them any more and because he cannot hurt anyone ... [v] reported that his father was also particularly strict on his grades and be constantly disappointed in his grades. he said that his father showed his disappointment by telling him that he was disappointed and would want him to do better. he denied that his father was angry with him, rather “it was lots of disappointment”.  4] ... [v] shrugged and said that it happened so many times that he could not remember where he was hit. he noted that his father would mainly hit him with his hands, and it would sometimes leave a mark ... [108] ... [v] reported that he feels that he should hate his father for all that he has done but that he is his father and he finds it hard to hate him. part of him wants to spend time with him and part of him does not. he noted that his mother is convinced “it’s a safety thing” and “she told me what she thinks”. i asked [v] what this is, and [v] responded, “she wants complete separation, no contact, to cut him [mr bergeron] out completely.” he then went on to say, “i didn’t ask for this” and that “i’m stuck between what my dad wants (orders he is seeking), what mum wants (no contact) and what i think.” [v] said that he wants to “see him [his father] on my own terms”. he clarified that he does want to have a relationship with his father, that he wants to be able to text his father when he wants and ask him if he is free and spend time with him for 2-3 hours, and that he would spend overnight time with his father if he chooses to do so. however, [v] was concerned that he “cannot leave them [his siblings] behind” and that they do not “go through what i went through”. [v] said that he does not know why his mother wants to cut his father out of his life and that his father “is not the complete monster he is made out to be” and that “a few actions do not determine him” ... [v] believes that his father hurt [x] (in august 2018) as [x] had bruises on his neck and body and that [x] would not have made that up. ... [110] ... [[v]] denied that his father ever talked negatively about his mother to him. [111] ... he said that the part he likes least about his mother is that “i do not like how she is obviously alienating dad” as “she is just giving all the bad parts of him”. i asked [v] about where he learned about alienation and he said that he did an english assignment on the movie “shrek” in which the character “shrek was being alienated”.
dr barnett: and when do you say to this court was the last time you hit [v]? father: i’ve only ever given [v] smack-bums and it would have been a long time ago. maybe when he was around the age of 12/13. dr barnett: because [v] says at paragraph 104 of the family report that you would sometimes hit him. do you accept that that’s true? father: in the context of smack-bums, yes. dr barnett: he says this: “he noted that his father would mainly hit him with his hands and it would sometimes leave a mark.” do you recall reading that? father: i’ve read the report, yes. dr barnett: do you recall reading that sentence? father: yes. sorry. yes. dr barnett: do you accept that you would hit him with your hands? father: yes. dr barnett: and do you accept that at times you’ve hit him with other things other than your hands? father: no. dr barnett: and you accept that sometimes you would leave a mark? father: no.[144]   pulling [v] by the back of his neck, dragging him to the family dog’s bowl, and forcing [v] to eat the dog’s food, [145] (2) nearly drowning him in the bath in country cy when [v] was seven,[146] (3) forcing [v] to drink mouthwash to the point that he gagged and coughed, when [v] was (inferentially) between five and seven years,[147] (4) pushing [v] against a wall so that he hit the back of his head and then punching him when [v] was 13 years,[148] and (5) punching “[v] on several occasions” on the family’s return to australia from the 2016 uk holiday,[149] he did not take the opportunity to raise these incidences with the expert, despite having ample opportunity to do so.   nearly drowning him in the bath in country cy when [v] was seven,[146] (3) forcing [v] to drink mouthwash to the point that he gagged and coughed, when [v] was (inferentially) between five and seven years,[147] (4) pushing [v] against a wall so that he hit the back of his head and then punching him when [v] was 13 years,[148] and (5) punching “[v] on several occasions” on the family’s return to australia from the 2016 uk holiday,[149] he did not take the opportunity to raise these incidences with the expert, despite having ample opportunity to do so.   forcing [v] to drink mouthwash to the point that he gagged and coughed, when [v] was (inferentially) between five and seven years,[147] (4) pushing [v] against a wall so that he hit the back of his head and then punching him when [v] was 13 years,[148] and (5) punching “[v] on several occasions” on the family’s return to australia from the 2016 uk holiday,[149] he did not take the opportunity to raise these incidences with the expert, despite having ample opportunity to do so.   pushing [v] against a wall so that he hit the back of his head and then punching him when [v] was 13 years,[148] and (5) punching “[v] on several occasions” on the family’s return to australia from the 2016 uk holiday,[149] he did not take the opportunity to raise these incidences with the expert, despite having ample opportunity to do so.   punching “[v] on several occasions” on the family’s return to australia from the 2016 uk holiday,[149] he did not take the opportunity to raise these incidences with the expert, despite having ample opportunity to do so.

[w]’s interview with the expert 5] ... her speech was rapid and pressured and she spoke in a monologue. her affect was anxious and she was observed to become visibly distressed during the interview. [116] ... she noted that they had another bird, but that her father let the bird out when he was angry with [v].  8] [w] said that her father has been hurting everybody. she noted that her father slammed the door on [y]’s face and then he said it was an accident. she said that her mother has been crying after she has been hurt by him and this makes [w] feel sad and she does not know what to do. she said that her father has punched her, kicked her, thown [sic] her, and he kicked people down the stairs. she added that when [v] was trying to defend their mother, her father would throw [v] and he would push them onto the wall. when [v] would not do his homework, her father would hurt him. when asked what her father would do to [v], she said “lots of things”, “my brother was just a doll”. she went on to say that when [y] and [x] would not eat, he would “shove it” down their throat.  9] [w] said that, on one occasion, she would run into the bathroom to hide from her father. she locked herself in the wardrobe. her father threw her into her bedroom and locked her in her room until her mother got home. she said that this happened when she was seven years old [presumably 2017, about two years prior to the interview]. [w] said that on another occasion, her father was “really grumpy at me, he threw a glass cup, it shattered on the floor, she stepped on it and hurt her foot.” she said this happened when she was eight years old.  0] [w] said that she was not happy, that she really wants to have a dad, that weekends were not fun. when they went on holidays, her father was “really grumpy” as he would take us places and hurt my mum, he threw her mother against the caravan wall. [121] [w] said that her parents separated because “my dad hurt everybody” ... [122] ... when she gets into trouble from her father, her father “gets angry, he starts hurting and when [x] would not go bed, dad pushed him over, stomped on his chest area and threw him against the door”. she said that [x] had a bruise on his forehead and bump on his head and that’s when all this “talking” started. [w] said that she was behind the door when this incident occurred, and [y] was crying. she said that her father did not admit to what he did but they had “proof”.  3] [w] said that she has not spent time with her father since he gave [x] a bruise and she does not want to see her father because “he’s done all these things to me. why would you want to see a dad that’s murdering his family?” and noted that he needs “guards [supervisors]”. i asked [w] how her father has hurt her, she responded with “lots of things”, “he’s hurt me”, “he said horrible things” such as telling her that her singing “was horrible”. [w] was very distressed about her father reportedly telling her that she was not a good singer. she also noted that after her father left, her teacher told her that she has improved a lot at school. she said that her father has also called her an “idiot”.  5] when asked about spending time with her father, [w] responded with “only once he learns... i do not want dad that horrible, i want to live a normal life, i want to be a great singer. i asked [w] to complete her above sentence, however [w] reported that “i paused because i realised i shouldn’t have said that”, that she is upset from all the things he has done. [126] [w] reported that “we’ve got all these problems” as her father was supposed to pay for the swimming bills and even though “he’s far away, but how can he still be hurting us?” [w] reported that there is nothing that her father can do to repair their relationship as “he has gone past the point where he needs to apologise”. her mother has told her that it is her choice, although her mother has been encouraging her to go to contact visits. she reported that her father stares at her when she comes to visits. [127] [w] was asked to consider the judge making orders for her to spend time with her father, [w] said “i do not know what i would do, i wouldn’t be able to see mummy, my mummy is everything, she comforts me, my family would be ruined”.
she reported feeling sad when she remembers “what he did” as when her father hits people “our skin went raw red”. she added that her father asked her to spy on her mother.[153]
there is no evidence in relation to the father asking [w] to spy on her mother.
dr barnett: on one occasion, you pulled [w] across the floor by her hair. she hit her head on the doorframe. didn’t you? father: no. ... dr barnett: and, as i understand your evidence, you say that the most physical chastisement that you’ve given to [w] is a smack on the bottom. is that right? father: yes. i’ve definitely picked her up if she has been in the wrong place or pulled out of the way if she’s in a dangerous situation, but i wouldn’t necessarily classify that as discipline. dr barnett: and during the relationship, that is, before separation, do you think [w] was scared of you? father: no. dr barnett: [w] records with the family consultant that she remembers on one occasion – this is paragraph 119 of the family report:
on one occasion, she would run into the bathroom to hide from her father. she locked herself in the wardrobe and her father threw her into the bedroom and locked her in the room until her mother got home.
do you recall reading that? father: yes. i assume it’s in there. yes. dr barnett: and what do you say? do you say that you ever locked her in her room? father: i’ve never locked her in her room, no. dr barnett: and you threw her into her bedroom from time to time? father: i’ve never thrown her into her bedroom, no. dr barnett: she also recalls at paragraph 119, that she recalls that you were really grump at her and you threw a glass cup and it shattered on the floor? father: i’ve never thrown a glass cup at anyone. there has been times when we drop glasses on the floor. dr barnett: then she stepped on it and hurt her foot? father: she did step on a glass after she hurt her foot – after it has been dropped on the floor, but it wasn’t thrown at her. dr barnett: [w] also recalls that she remembers an occasion when you slammed the door on [y]’s face and then that you said it was an accident. do you recall reading that? father: i recall reading it, yes. dr barnett: you did that, didn’t you? you slammed the door and it hit [y]? father: i’ve never slammed a door in [y]’s face, no. dr barnett: [w] also says that you have punched her, kicked her and thrown her? father: i’ve never punched or kicked her. we have done, like, throwing in the air games and those sort of things in the pool dr barnett: so you are saying to this court that the things that [w] records about you are false? father: in that part of the family report, yes. elsewhere maybe not. dr barnett: and you would say to his honour that there is absolutely no basis for these matters at paragraph 118 and 119, other than the fact that a glass did break and she did step on it, there is no basis for her to fear you. is that right? father: that’s right, your honour.[154]
[x]’s interview with the expert 0] ... he said that there was a lot of fighting between his parents when they used to live together as a family. he does not recall what the fighting was about rather he recollected that “they were shouting”. he said that there used to be hitting each other, where [y] used to hit most of them and that [z] liked hitting them. he said that there was no one else who used to hit each other.  1] [x] reported that his parents separated because “he was too rough” and “dad hurt mummy” and that he saw bruises on his mother. in response to whether he saw his father hit his mother, [x] stated “he normally does kick and stuff. he sometimes hits us normally”.  1] ... he said that his father used to hit him “probably everyplace”.  1] ... [x] reported that his father strangled him on one occasion, and he cried. he said that he started to hit his father and then his father hit him and that is what caused the bruising on the right side of his head. he was with [z] at the time of this incident.  1] ... he reported that he does not want to spend time with his father because he has hurt him and noted that his brother does not want to go either. he said that he is scared of his father. he said that if the judge said he had to go, [x] said, “no, i won’t go, i’ll say no, my older brother does not want to go.” he said he heard his father say a rude word to his mother - “stupid”.  2] [x] reported that his mother hits him on the bottom “when i get told off”. [x] reported that the best things about his mother is that she spends time with him, doing fun things and going out with him to [location ff]. he reported that what he likes least about his mother is that “she hurts me” and that she hurts him “normally everywhere”.  3] ... on one occasion, [x] reported that his father shut the door and his hand got stuck in the door. he said that his father hits him harder than his mother does. in relation to [x]’s three wishes, he said that he wants his father to stop hurting them and to be a “proper dad” by doing fun things with them like he used to, such as going to [location ff].

ms q, manager of school s 5] ... [ms q] reported that [ms bergeron] had discussed the allegations of violence against [mr bergeron] and they are aware that [ms bergeron] has mental health issues. ... [146] ... [ms q] reported that [x] has had some occasional behavioural issues, but indicated that it was not outside the norm for his developmental stage ... [ms q] denied that [x] or the other children had ever drawn scissors or any other implement in a threatening manner at school and that, if this had occurred, she would be aware of it. she noted that she was aware that such behaviour had been occurring at home.  7] ...reported that, on one occasion, [x] reported that his father hurt him and that, on one occasion in the last 12 months, [w] reported that her father hurt her mother. she has not seen the children present to school with any injuries over the years.
ms r, [x]’s psychologist
...a history of violence throughout the relationship, that she was separated, that the children were having supervised contact with their father, and that [x] has used scissors on at least three occasions to threaten children at school.[162]
ms bp, marriage counsellor
most concerned about [ms bergeron’s] mental health at the time and the impact of this on the children, [mr bergeron] was not concerned about [ms bergeron’s] mental health. [166]
ms u, [w]’s play therapist
...to easy [sic] anxiety, process anger about not seeing her father, and to build resilience.[167]  4] ... [w] presented as a very anxious, hyperactive and completely unregulated child, who lived in a fantasy world in the therapy room. she also presented as very regressed in her session and mature in the real world, where she had to be in a position to look after her siblings ... [155] [ms u] noted that the children were at times unkempt. she also noted that [ms bergeron] was hard to gauge, where at times she was disengaged and made no eye contact and at other times she was more engaged and made eye contact. she noted that the children were wild in the waiting room with the children not dressed properly and [ms bergeron] falling asleep in the waiting room with the children around her. [156] she wanted to liaise with other people involved with the children, however, she noted that [ms bergeron] would not give a straight answer and could not give her names of people involved. [157] [ms u] reported that [w] was a very confused child who felt like she had no control, she wanted to see her father, however, her mother did not want them to see her father.[168]  8] [ms u] believes that, at times, [w] was told what to say. she noted the incident where [w] and [ms bergeron] both appeared angry on one occasion, where [w] was telling [ms bergeron] that it is her responsibility to talk to the court, and on the way out she noted that [w] got angry with her mother for telling her what to say.  9] ... [w] genuinely wanted to see her father but was frightened because of what happened to [x], which [w] said she witnessed. she noted that [w] told her that her father has never done anything to her.[169]   “has punched her, kicked her, thrown her”,[170] (2) “threw her into her bedroom and locked her in her room until her mother got home”,[171] and (3) “threw a glass cup, it shattered on the floor, she stepped on it and hurt her foot”.[172]   “threw her into her bedroom and locked her in her room until her mother got home”,[171] and (3) “threw a glass cup, it shattered on the floor, she stepped on it and hurt her foot”.[172]   “threw a glass cup, it shattered on the floor, she stepped on it and hurt her foot”.[172]
ms aa, [x]’s previous play therapist 0] ... she described [x] as chaotic and anxious ... overall, [ms aa] reported that [x] did not have a good attachment to his mother. ... [162] ... [x] spoke about his fear for his father and that he hated him, and made allegations of being strangled by him. she reported that, if she tried to encourage [x] to talk, he would shut down.
dr bq, the mothers’ medical practitioner 7] [dr bq] reported that [ms bergeron] referred herself, through the domestic violence line, in around the end of 2015 or beginning of 2016, for trauma in her marriage. ... [dr bq] first became aware of allegations of violence when [ms bergeron] was pregnant with [z] and [ms bergeron] alleged that [z]’s conception was a product of rape, there was a lot of conflict between them, and that [mr bergeron] raped her post-[z]’s birth and she lost consciousness.  8] [dr bq] reported that [ms bergeron] has been more forthcoming about the violence since the incident with [x] in august 2018, as [ms bergeron] previously felt responsible for [mr bergeron’s] care and [ms bergeron] was aware that [dr bq] was a mandatory reporter.  9] ... [dr bq] reported that allegations about violence against the children began to be disclosed after [x]’s court case, where [ms bergeron] alleged that [mr bergeron] had hurt the children on occasion, not a lot. i asked her which children [mr bergeron] allegedly hurt, [dr bq] said [v] and [w].  1] ...current diagnosis for [ms bergeron] is complex post-traumatic stress disorder (ptsd) in the context of a history of multiple interpersonal traumas. .... she reported that [ms bergeron’s] mental health is quite good at the moment (28 june 2019) and that she does not require medication. ... [dr bq] noted that [ms bergeron] no longer sees [dr bu] due to the fracture in their relationship as a result of the notification she made in relation to concerns about [z]’s alleged failure to thrive.[174]   bq] reported that [ms bergeron] has never engaged in self-harming behaviour and has never used illicit substances or alcohol.[177]
evaluation by the expert 7] this is a complex matter with no consensus on facts about the nature of the parental relationship. the issue of whether [x]’s injury was an accidental injury or a non-accidental injury indicative of a wider spread dynamic of coercive controlling violence perpetrated by [mr bergeron] is the predominant issue in this matter. this matter is further complicated by [ms bergeron’s] presentation as an inaccurate historian and, as such, concerns are raised about her ability to accurately recollection events ... a. the benefit of the children having a meaningful relationship with both of the children’s parents [178] ...whilst [ms bergeron] reported she directly encourages the children’s relationship with their father, it is apparent from the interview with [v], observations of her interactions with the children during the interview process, notes from the supervised contact service and reports from therapists, that she does not. [179] the children are either overtly or covertly aware that their mother does not encourage their relationship with their father, and this is likely one of the underlying issue maintaining: the children’s refusal to spend time with their father, their reluctance to express positive views about their father, and the children’s challenging behaviour at changeover. it would be confusing and anxiety-provoking for the children, and manipulative of [ms bergeron], to express one view about their father in public and to express another view of [mr bergeron] to the children in private.  0] ... it is noted that, at times of disagreement about rules and boundaries, children can use one parent against the other if the parents are not united in their parenting approach with the children. this appears to have occurred with [v] during the parental relationship, where developmentally he was at an age where he would test limits, resulting in [v] aligning with his more lenient parent, in this case, his mother, and turning against his father’s attempt to implement rules and boundaries. furthermore, children needs rules and boundaries in order to feel safe and secure, and they want to know that their parent is in charge and competent to help them stay in control, especially at times where a child is themselves emotionally dysregulated. [ms bergeron’s] parenting style appears to also be a contributing factor to the children’s uncontained presentation, as [ms bergeron] does not have the skills to emotionally contain the children and to impose rules and limits with authority. [mr bergeron’s] parenting style, if the court were to find that his version of the relationship was accurate, is more likely to promote a sense of security, where clear limits and consistent boundaries are in force, and promote good emotional regulation in the children. [181] it is apparent that [ms bergeron] experiences difficulties in implementing limits and boundaries for the children, and this is likely to become a greater issue as the children get older and reach adolescence, a period when children increasingly challenge parental limit setting. it is concerning that, at only six years old, [x] responds to his mother with physical violence. ... there is no evidence available that [x]’s aggression is a generalised behavioural issue, rather, it appears that [x]’s behaviour is a specific dynamic to his relationship with his mother.
b. the need to protect the children from physical and psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect, or family violence [182] ... subpoenaed facs material indicated that [mr bergeron] has not been interviewed by facs in relation to allegations of family violence. facs notes indicated that case workers made continuous efforts to contact [mr bergeron] and he did not reply or return any phone calls. [ms bergeron] had reported to case workers that [mr bergeron] had moved from the family home and was residing in an apartment in [suburb dz], and that she was not aware of the address. [ms bergeron] reported during this assessment that she assisted [mr bergeron] to find accommodation, which is inconsistent with facs documentation. [mr bergeron] reported during the interview with me that he avoided contact with facs at [ms bergeron’s] request.  3] ... there is no evidence from school that the children have a history of presenting to school with injuries. [w] was interviewed by facs in 2017, where she described her parents shouting, her father smacking bottoms when in trouble, denying that her father uses hands on her mother, and that her father smacks [v] a lot because he is always on the phone. [v] was also interviewed on this occasion and there were no reported incidences of violence by him. subpoenaed facs material also indicates that [v] was interviewed by facs case workers in 2018, where he reported that he likes his father and would like to see him three times per week ... during this interview process, [v] reported that his father hit him, but did not recount specific details of physical abuse that he was allegedly subjected to by his father. furthermore, [dr bq] stated that [ms bergeron] reported to her that [mr bergeron’s] violence was directed towards [v] and [w]. there was also information from [w]’s play therapist that her father has never hurt her, though he had hurt [x]. whilst [w]’s dramatic and emotive representation of her father’s alleged violence towards her family is concerning, during interview with [w], she did not recount specific details of violent events that her father had subjected her to ...  5] ... it is concerning that [y] is spontaneously recalling events for which she has no explicit memory, rather, this appears to be indicative of post hoc explanations given to a child. this would be confusing for [y], whether she experienced the violence or not. there are also accounts of [ms bergeron] misreporting violence to others, for example, her reporting to [ms r] about [x]’s violent tendencies at school, where there is no evidence of this from school staff. [186] there is also documentation, since 2016, whereby [ms bergeron] has reported to either facs, medical professionals or mental health professionals, that she has been a victim of physical and sexual abuse by [mr bergeron]. subpoenaed facs material indicated that [ms bergeron] presented to [g hospital] on 26 june 2016 with a friend, upon referral by her gp, to review her mood, and they noted that [ms bergeron] had a faded black eye and bruising on her forearm. [ms bergeron] did not report how she sustained the injury. [ms bergeron] reported being physically and sexually assaulted by her partner. she denied that the children had been exposed to domestic violence and denied that they would be impacted by it ... ... [188] whilst this is not determinative in any way, on assessment of [mr bergeron], he did not present as a coercive, controlling person. he accepted responsibility for the event for where there is evidence that he hurt [x], and as wanting to repair his relationship with [x]. most perpetrators of coercive controlling family violence would minimise, deny or blame others, and [mr bergeron’s] attitude is not consistent with a perpetrator of coercive controlling violence.  9] ... [x] and [w] will not express a desire to see their father unless [ms bergeron] overtly encourages their relationship with their father and expresses this to them in a definitive manner. if [ms bergeron’s] allegations are determined to be inaccurate by the court, it would suggest that she may have using her children as a means to punish [mr bergeron], that [ms bergeron] may have become panicked by feelings of loss or abandonment, and has become convinced that [mr bergeron] is irrespective and dangerous, and perceives herself as the only responsible and safe parent. if this were to be the case, children in such a situation can become distressed, cling to the needy parent, and resist contact with the other parent.
c. the nature of the children’s relationship with each of their parents and with any other relevant persons ... [191] [v]’s interview ... indicated that he enjoyed spending time with his father, that he saw his father after the parental separation, and that this was going well. [v] has consistently declined to attend supervised contact with his father.  1] ... [v] presented a reasonably balanced view of his family and did not appear to be aligned with either parent. [v] expressed a desire to have a relationship with his father to the exclusion of supervisors, as this would be more genuine and would not be used as evidence in court ...  2] ... this would have placed [w] in a difficult position of having to appease her mother and would have been an untenable position to be in for a child.
section 3 – child behaviours of concern [ms bergeron] explains that [w] is physically lashing out at her and her brother, [x]. [ms bergeron] felt that [w] is very angry at [x]. ms bergeron explains that [w] feels it is [x]’s fault that she is no longer able to see her father, due to the recent avo taken out against [mr bergeron] for assaulting [x]. ms bergeron advised that she is really concerned because [mr bergeron] favours [w]. she explains that [mr bergeron] only hurts the boys and favours his daughters. [ms bergeron] shared that [w] will not listen to her mum when she explains to [w] the reasons for the avo. difficult times for the child [ms bergeron] advised that [w] adores her dad and will often say that dad would never hurt her. [ms bergeron] shared that [w] cried for four hours after finding out she could not see or talk to her dad.[179]  3] subpoenaed material from the supervised contact of the children ([w], [x], [y] and [z]) have noted that initially the children’s time with their father was positive, despite having had no contact with him from late august 2018 to mid-january 2019. [x] then started to exhibit physical aggression towards his mother and name-calling at changeover, for example, [x] calling his father “poo-poo head”, and [x] stopped going to spend time with his father. [w] also started to show distress and ambivalence for some time at changeover and was noted to be given the choice by supervisors and her mother about whether to see her father or not, and that she was in immense inner turmoil.  3] ... this appears to be a significant turning point for [w]. since then, [w] started to express that she does not want to spend time with her father and indicated that she does not want to have a relationship with her father because he hurt her. [w] declined to participate in observations on the day of interviews with her father, and she consistently spoke in a matter-of-fact manner about not wanting to do so. furthermore, [ms bergeron] was requested to encourage [w] to spend time with her father, which she attempted to do in a passive and unconvincing manner, an approach that would not lead to [w] spending time with her father. [194] subpoenaed notes from the supervised centre have noted that [z] and [y] transitioned well between their parents, they enjoyed spending time with her father, and they recognised their father as a significant person in their lives. observations of [z] and [y] on the day of the assessment indicated that [z] and [y] enjoy spending time with their father and they can use him as a source of comfort.[181]  6] [w] appears to be parentified, has taken on the role of being her mother’s helper, and is distressed about the possibility of losing her mother.  6] ... it seems that she worries about her mother and likely acts to placate and calm her mother at times her mother is exhibiting distress. [w] appears worried that she will not be able to see her mother if she is with her father and that, if she has a relationship with her father, that it will be to the exclusion of her mother. [w] is also aware that her mother would feel sad if she were to be with her father, and this is also likely a contributing [sic] to [w]’s sense of anxiety and refusal to spend time with her father.[182]  7] [x] appears ... to have an insecure attachment to his mother. [ms bergeron] struggles to implement rules and boundaries with [x] and he responds to her with physical violence.
d. the likely effect of any changes in the children’s circumstances [200] this issue of whether [mr bergeron] has perpetrated coercive controlling violence towards his family is that [sic] the forefront of this matter. it appears that there is an ongoing conversation in [ms bergeron’s] home about [mr bergeron’s] alleged violence towards her and the children. whether this is accurate or not, is not able to be determined by this assessment alone, however the children have a narrative of their father as an abusive person and this has adversely affected [mr bergeron’s] relationship with the children.[183]  1] [ms bergeron] appears to have difficulty in supporting the children spending supervised time with their father and it appears did not want the children to have a relationship with him.  1] ... she would likely experience immense difficulty in supporting the children spending unsupervised time with their father and would have to cease disparaging him or sharing details, whether accurate or not, of issues she has or has had with [mr bergeron] ...
e. the capacity of each parent and other persons relevant to provide for the children’s needs including emotional and intellectual needs [203] ... there is evidence that the children’s physical needs are not being met adequately by [ms bergeron], as indicated by information from the school and therapist. there is also evidence that [ms bergeron] does not adequately provide for the children’s emotional needs, as there are indications from the children’s interviews, interactions with the children and [ms bergeron], information from therapeutic sources and supervised contact notes, that [ms bergeron] has attempted to influence the children, to create within them negative feelings, attitudes and emotions, about their father. [ms bergeron] was asked to encourage [w] to spend time with her father on the day of the assessment. [ms bergeron] did not use her personal connection with [w] to encourage her to spend time with her father, and the encouragement was not owned by her. there was also information from [v]’s interview that [ms bergeron] does not encourage his relationship with his father, rather, she is seeking to cease all contact of the children with their father ...
f. the attitude towards the children and responsibilities of parenthood as demonstrated by each of the children’s parents [205] [ms bergeron] appears to be heavily involved in the school community and reports she is coping well since the parental separation. this is contrary to observations made by the children’s therapist, [w]’s interview, and observations during this assessment process. she appears to be overwhelmed, there is evidence that the children’s physical needs have not been attended to, and she has declined specialised support services, such as [fp family centre], to assist her.  9] [w], being the eldest female child, has been most vocal in this dispute and has taken on the burdensome role of spokesperson and parenting of her siblings. [w] presented as an anxious child when interviewed, and there are significant concerns about her future mental health.  1] ... there is no evidence that [x] was observed to be fearful in his father’s presence post the incident in august 2018, in the supervised context. [x] has presented to therapy, where he reports violence by, and fear of, his father. [x] appears to be focused on his father apologising to him. this would be appropriate that this occur and conducive to [x]’s emotional recovery, and it is noted that [mr bergeron] is willing to do so and has been seeking that the family partake in family therapy. [211] there are concerns that [y] is spontaneously recalling events for which she has no explicit memory, rather, is indicative of post hoc explanations given to children, which would be confusing for her, whether they experienced the violence or not. this would also be consistent with [v]’s interview, whereby he reported that he has been given information post-separation by his mother about the parental relationship and this has impacted his relationship with both parents ...  2] [z]’s presentation appears to have remained stable and she seems to have positive interactions with both parents ...
h. the effects upon the children, if any, from potential or actual physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse ... [215] it appears that there is inconsistent care provided by [ms bergeron], that the children are at risk of physical and emotional harm, and at risk of developing psychological disorders themselves. there are also accounts of [ms bergeron] misreporting violence, for example, to [x]’s therapist, and then [x] receiving therapy on the basis of misreported information, with the therapist having made no attempt to corroborate the information provided to her by [ms bergeron]. i have concerns for the children in the care of their mother, especially since she has declined specialised support services for her family, and there has been no allowance for services involved with various family members to work collaboratively. i. whether either party has any psychological or psychiatric condition or mental health issues which may affect either party’s parenting capacity, and if so, what are those impacts ... [217] there are inconsistencies with respect to [ms bergeron’s] narrative during this interview process. [ms bergeron] has a history of low mood, emotion dysregulation, suicidal ideation, deliberate self-harm, and anxiety, which would have likely developed in the context of an invalidating and unsupporting family of origin, ongoing anxiety about her father’s health and wellbeing, her childhood sexual abuse and consequently being threatened by the perpetrator with her father’s death, a history of bullying in high school, her physical ill health during pregnancy, and anxiety with [y]’s breath-holding after a car accident (as documented by [dr bu] in the subpoenaed medical notes).  0] [ms bergeron] presented with emotion dysregulation, which would likely impact on her ability to provide a consistent, organised, calm approach to parenting and would affect the children’s ability to regulate their own emotions ...
cross-examination of the expert
i think, if the court were to decide that the children spend time with the father, unsupervised, then i think that is worth attempting that because it hasn’t been attempted so far, i know the children have spent time, seen various therapists, but it hasn’t included both parents. so if the court were to decide that the children spend time with their – with their father, i think that it will be worth attempting a period of time, perhaps six months, of therapy and then seeing how that may progress. if it’s not useful, then i would say then that would, at least, have been attempted and it’s not useful.[185]
it would have been empowering but also, in my experience in working in this field, it’s very difficult for a child to have to make that decision, especially when they understand that their parents are in conflict. and having to make that choice about spending time with the parent is not always easy for a child, when they’re given a choice to do so or not.[186]
yes, it does, because i think that his parenting, in that regard, remains untested.[187]
i think that’s also fraught as well. i guess, in my assessment so far, there have been issues with her decision-making around the children’s care, especially medical or for therapeutic needs, without the involvement of the father, and that has been a concern for me. so that would raise questions for me about whether that would continue and whether any care that’s provided to the children is biased and accurate.[188]
what would be the purpose of that, would be my question. in my experience, that would be only for the purpose of identity and that the father have some – the children have some kind of connection to their father and know he’s the father, but he certainly wouldn’t be able to have a significant relationship or meaningful relationship with the children in that regard, if that was to be the outcome in this – in this family.[189]
i think that that would be very difficult for the children to manage that. they would question where their father has gone. i think that would be distressing for the children if that was to be minimised so significantly, given my observations of the children and their children at the time.[190]
i do recall that there was an incident where things were going quite well with [w] and her father and they were quite positive, together with [x] as well, but there was a period of time where she felt quite confused and uncertain about whether to spend time with the father when she was given the choice to do so, and, in my experience with children of that age, when they are given the choice about spending time with a parent, as i said previously, it is very difficult for them to make that call when they know that there is conflict, or such significant conflict, between parents. it is very difficult for them to be able to spend time freely with the other parent.[191]
my understanding that the father recommended [ms bj] from [bk counsellors] to attend family therapy. i think that would be an excellent choice for [x] and – or the family in whatever configuration, if that was to occur. i think [ms bj] would be very suitable for this family in terms of just the way that she engages with the family and her presentation, and i think that she would be a good choice if that were something that was to be ordered.[194] ... whatever the outcome might be, i think that [ms bj] would be a preferred choice for therapy for this family. i have spoken to [ms bj] as well about it, and she is willing to take this family on if that were something that the court would decide. [195]
... mum is pretty convinced it’s a safety thing. he’s my dad. she told me what she thinks. she wants completed separation, no contact, to cut him out completely. i didn’t ask for this. i’m stuck between what my dad wants, what my mum wants and what i think.[196]
mr cook: if [w] was to be removed from living with the mother to live with the father, what impact would that have on her? expert: [w] in particular i’m very worried about. given that she is the eldest female child, i think she has taken on a maternal role with her siblings. she’s very much in tune with her mother and is very worried about her mother, very distressed about the idea of being separated from her, and that worried me. i was very worried about her mental health at the time. if she was to be separated from her mother, i think that will be very distressing for her. i – i – yes, i think that will be very distressing for – for [w] to be separated from her mother, and primarily because i think that she has been the one to take on a parenting role with her siblings as well, i think that that would be – put her in a difficult predicament about how she would take care of her – her mother and her siblings if that – she was to be separated from them.[197]
mr cook: would that be something that could be addressed by therapy? expert: yes. mr cook: or is the benefit – and how would you balance of the difficulties that [w] would face from being parentified, stresses and – that that creates against the distress that she would feel if she was removed, in essence, from her mother? expert: sure. yes. yes. mr cook: how do you balance those up? expert: yes. i think that whichever household [w] lives in, she would need assistance and support with being removed from that parenting role. that is my impression of [w]. so she would need, i think, assistance with – with that, whichever household she might need – be in, and that would be something that a psychologist would be able to support her with. i think that, whichever household [w] lives in, she would need assistance and support with being removed from that parenting role. that is my impression of [w]. so she would need, i think, assistance with – with that, whichever household she might need – begin, and that would be something that a psychologist would be able to support her with.[198]
his honour: with her mother, she’s parenting her siblings? expert: yes. his honour: and her mother? expert: yes. his honour: with her father, she would be parenting her siblings? expert: correct. [w] is also very aware of her mother’s emotional wellbeing, was my sense when i spoke to her. there were times – i mean, there was an incident where i recall she mentioned that, you know, mum may get upset or distressed, whatever it is, and takes time out, you know, to go into her room, and that was something that [w] is aware of. and so, you know, in that case, when a – when a parent takes time out or, you know, goes into their room to manage their own distress, that leaves the other children to manage things within that household, and that’s something to consider, you know, how that’s – that is managed in the household. yes. his honour: and if [w] is parenting – parentified re her mother, then that would lead to [w] being protective of her mother through this process, wouldn’t it? expert: she was very – i think she’s very protective of her mother. she’s very, very worried about her, even in the observation period when i – i recall that [v] was quite disengaged and sitting in on the couch and not really participating, you know, and i get it. for him it was difficult because he thought it was all fake, as – as he said, and i noticed that [w] was the one that tried to engage her brother in the process. so even in that context, in that assessment process, she actively tried to parent and coach her brother, her older brother, in that instance to participate in this process, and i - his honour: so she sees herself as the little mother all round? expert: she is. she is. his honour: and that’s not good for her? expert: no. no, i was very worried about [w]’s mental health, and i’m concerned about her future mental health, and at the moment, you know, of course, it has been almost two years since i saw [w], but at the time i was very worried about her future mental health, her safety, a risk that she might pose to herself, whether she would self-harm or whether she was suicidal in the future and whether she might go on to have a diagnosis of mental health herself in the future, and that’s quite probable. his honour: and she needs the intervention to address that? expert: she – she needs – she does. yes. his honour: and she needs intervention that can’t be tainted by a parent, either parent? expert: correct. yes.[199]
i think that that would also be very difficult for him, as well, i mean, [x] also has a history of lashing out and physical aggression, and so i would be quite concerned about his safety, and a parent’s safety, as well, but – and how that would be managed by a parent if he was to be moved from the primary residency of his mum. so if he was to be moved, for example, i think the father would really need some – some really good skills about how to manage [x]’s aggression if he was to lash out and want to return to his mum, for example, and how far he might go with expressing his views about that.[201]
mr cook: now, [y]? expert: sure. mr cook: she says at the bottom of page 43, paragraph 137:
daddy can hurt us. he can do anything to hurt us. he always hurts me. he can do anything to hurt.
mr cook: now, she was four at the time of the interview, and the parties separated in december ’17, so she was about three at the time that they separated. is it likely that a child at the age of three would have memories of the sorts of violence that – of hurting that [y]’s making reference to? expert: look, i think if there has been a narrative of that in the house that has been repeated, i think it’s quite possible that that exposure to that might have made a difference to her in terms of her being able to recall events. whether she actually saw those events herself – i mean, it’s difficult, i think, because of her young age. you know, she would have been younger than three if she had seen any events, and i think that that’s – that that will be difficult.
his honour: isn’t there a, i will call it a theory, it might be more, because i’m not a scientific minded person, but isn’t there a fairly widely accepted theory that as humans we get an amnesia at around three years of age, a bit this side or a bit that side of three years, of what has happened to us beforehand? expert: yes. his honour: and that a person asserting that they remember an event happening to them when they were two or two years and two months and so forth is very, very unlikely, and so if they do assert that, there’s another reason - expert: yes. his honour: - for them asserting so? expert: yes. his honour: you agree with that? expert: yes.
they would believe that they had been placed in an unsafe environment with their father without intervention, and without being able to have that view challenged if that was not correct. so that would be the narrative of their father that would hold into adulthood, that their father is a violent person.[202]
mr cook: now, do you see any difference between a person not encouraging a relationship, in this case, the mother, the children with the father to one of alienation? expert: i have thought about this. the mother – the mother’s – her premise is that there have been allegations of violence, and that violence – that history of violence is something that she feels she can’t support in terms of a relationship with the children, and so in that regard, she feels it’s more of a – it’s not alienation. so from her perspective, it’s not. she feels that there are realistic safety concerns about the children in the care of their father, and so that’s what she’s saying. ... look, i mean, there have been – look, it’s difficult to say. i don’t think that there is – i think we can – i can safely exclude pure alienation. it’s not, i think, consistent in this matter. i think there have incidences that have occurred that have led to where we are now. have they been poorly managed. absolutely. if things were managed differently after [x]’s events with his father, perhaps things would be different. i don’t know what the history of the relationship was between the parents. the mother holds a very strong view that she was in a relationship that involved coercive, controlling violence, and if that account is accurate, then i have concerns about the children’s safety in the care of their father. the father strongly refutes that, and he has a resolute perspective of that, as well.[203]
these children need boundaries. these children need limits. they need to – and when children have limits and boundaries, they feel safe, because they know where a parent stands. i understand that mum has used some attachment parenting in the past and, you know, that forms her – i guess, her parenting in some way. she is very much child-led in that regard and didn’t want – does not want to create and implement rules about the children spending time or, you know, chores and so forth with – in the household. i think that’s problematic, and i think that children need chores. they need to have boundaries and limits in place, otherwise, they are at risk of antisocial behaviour, they’re at risk of their own mental health issues in the future, and i think that that’s something that’s problematic. i mean, i – it’s not – it’s problematic for the children’s future wellbeing, in my perspective, but also, as well, we have one child, in particular, [x], who at the time was exhibiting aggressive behaviour, and that requires limits. i understand she has tried to put limits in place, and i think that’s really positive.[204]
mr cook: what does a coercive, controlling person present as? expert: a person who presents that way, in my experience in these assessments, takes no responsibility whatsoever, lacks empathy towards their children, and it’s not something that i saw in the father, as well. i mean, i – he was able to take responsibility for some of the things that have occurred with [x] and wants to be able to rectify that. in that regard, i guess, it was something that i thought was a strength in the father. mr cook: so his attitude is not consistent with the perpetrator of coercive controlling violence. well, what was the attitude that led you to that? expert: okay. well, because his attitude – he wasn’t defensive at all. you know, i get – i find that sometimes, when there is coercive control, a parent who is in that situation is quite defensive, takes no responsibility whatsoever and is quite difficult in interview, and one won’t answer questions, but i felt like he was quite open. he – he answered my questions in a direct manner. he wasn’t defensive. he was quite patient when things were – had to be changed in terms of the parenting arrangement or, you know, on the day, because of, you know, various things that had occurred. he was quite flexible, and so he wasn’t rigid at all, as well, and i think those characteristics were really important to note. [205]
his honour: if i indicate this to you- expert: yes. his honour: - and dr barnett, please correct me if i’m misstating or going too far on behalf of your client, but i perceive a situation in the courtroom where the mother cannot cope with – expert: yes. his honour: - being in line of sight of the father? expert: sure. his honour: looking at the father and so forth. if that’s the case, what does that tell us about the possibility of equal share parental responsibility? expert: i think it will be an untenable situation, and i think if the mother was to have primary care of the children that sole parental responsibility is probably best given to her.[206]
his honour: what are the dangers to [z], both at the time and for her future development, in transferring her from her primary attachment figure to a person who has not been a stable attachment figure other than the small amounts of time? expert: i think the risks are great for [z]. i think it poses risk to her attachment security. despite what the mother had mentioned, and i understand she’s alleging that she was sexually assaulted and the conception of [z] was in that context, and i – certainly, i cannot comment on that, whether that’s accurate or not. either way, the subpoena material over, you know, through medical records, facts facs documentation and my observations were that i thought that she had a good relationship with [z]. i think that the attachment was secure, and i think that the mother responded to [z] positively and well, and she attended to her needs when i saw the [sic] her. and can i just add, as well, that the children are at very different developmental stages, and i understand that, you know, [x], [w] are probably in some respects one aspect of it, and then there is [z] and [y] on the other hand, who are a different – at a different stage of their development, and their needs are also very different, so whilst [x] and [w] might manage the change of residency different, they will manage it differently. they will find it distressing, but they may settle over time. i think for [z], for [y], the risks are different, because of their young age at the time of separation and their being in the exclusive primary care of their mother at the time of separation.[207]
...she will still seek her mum if she’s separated from her mum and placed into her father’s care. how will that be managed by the father if that was to happen, if he’s seeking a three-month period of no contact at all between the children and the mother, whilst for [x] and for [w] that may be okay, and the risks may not be that great for them, for [z] that’s going to be completely detrimental, i think, to her attachment formation and her security not to have contact with her mother for three months at all, and that’s an important consideration. ... the mother is a primary attachment figure, and so, for change of residencies to occur, then the risks to [z] really need to be considered, i think. so, as i said, you know, with [x] and with [w], they may manage the transition better over time in a period of unsettled – will be expected, but they will settle, but for [z] i think that the implications on her developments will be greater if there is a change of residency, given her young age at this point in time, and the father’s proposal of no contact for three months.[208]
his honour: just because we’ve only got so much time, but just one other question, which is possibly a hard one, and may not be capable of answer. is there anything you can say to me about comparing the risks to [z] in, on the one hand, being removed from her primary attachment figure and the problems that will cause for her, and on the other hand, the potentiality that she will lose her relationship with her other parent and grow and develop from between three and four years of age without that relationship, due to one cause or another? expert: sure. all right. so i think that if there is to – so the question was in relation to [z] specifically? his honour: to [z]. [z]? expert: yes. his honour: i’m asking it because of [z]’s age at the moment? expert: okay. his honour: so – expert: about whether there were to be a change of residency, what would be the implications for her? his honour: well, what i’m saying is on the one hand with the change of residency and [z] losing her primary attachment figure and not being able to look back and see that her movement away is safe, as far as she has gone, because her attachment figure is there, to use the illustration, and on the other hand the potential for [z] to not have a relationship with her father? expert: right. okay. i think both of those risks are real, and i think the risk of the children not having a relationship with their father – all of the children not having a relationship with their father, i think, is a real possibility. i don’t know whether the mother will be able to support a relationship with the children and their father as they get older, especially, you know, i guess, in the case where they’re – three of the children, now she’s proposing that they spend time with their father as per their wishes. it may be the case that as the children – as [z] and [y] get older she will also give them the choice, as well, and i foresee that that will also be consistent with their older siblings’ view about their father, as well. so i think it’s quite possible in that case that the children will possibly, ultimately, lose their relationship with their father.[209]
specifically for [z], i think the risks for her to be placed with her father are quite great, given her young age at this time, and at the time when i saw her. i think if – it could be very traumatising for her, and it could be viewed as a traumatic event for her to be removed from her mum, and if it is going to be happening, i think that it needs to be carefully considered, – because we do not want – these children already have been exposed to so much. i wouldn’t want the children to be exposed to any more trauma, and that may be considered as a traumatic event for [z], if that was to happen. i think it will have effects on her ability to form secure relationships in the future into adolescence, into adulthood. that is a risk, however, on the other hand, as well, i mean, the other risk, as well, is if the father’s account is accurate, then if the mother is to make – continue to make false allegations – unsubstantiated false allegations about their father, then that’s also detrimental to the children, as well, and that risk also needs to be carefully considered if the father’s account is accurate, because, if the children grow up in a household where the narrative is that their father was violent and unsafe, that will also pose risks to their mental health, as well. they will lose their relationship with their father, and that is something that is also a possibility, as well.[210]
i’ve thought about that, as well. ideally, the children should travel as a unit. they should remain a unit.[212]
mr cook: now, i will ask you two hard questions, and you can decline to answer them if you – if it’s appropriate. if the recommendation – if the notions of domestic violence perpetrated by the father on the mother and the children are accepted as true – expert: yes. mr cook: what recommendation do you make in terms of parental responsibility and time, if any – expert: sure. mr cook: - and so on with the children and the father? expert: okay. in that case, i would recommend sole pr to the mother, that the children live with the mother and the children have no contact with their father, or there be no orders. mr cook: for the – expert: for the children about the father spending time with the children. mr cook: you can probably guess what the next question is going to be. if the allegations of violence are not accepted as true, what do you recommend? expert: that’s a harder question, because of the different developmental stages of the children that are – we are talking about, and i’ve noted previously my concerns about the two younger children and the impact that that might have. of course, if the court found that the father’s history was accurate, that is a significantly concerning account. i guess what the father is suggesting is that the mother has spent many, many years telling lots of different services, child protection services, family violence services, schools, medical professionals that the father is violent when he’s not. that – the impact of that on the children cannot be underestimated, the harm that does for the children to have not only a perspective of their father as a violent person when he’s not, but also a narrative in the extended community about the father being a violent person when he’s not. mr cook: so the children would live with the father? expert: that’s a hard one. i don’t have an answer to that, because i think [z], in particular, the risks to her living with her father, i think, are really going to be difficult for me to comment on, but i think consideration needs to be given. consideration needs to be given to the children living with their father, and the father to be supported by a therapist, possibly by [ms bj], and he mentioned in his affidavit that his mother could come out and help with the children, but he would need significant support for that to happen. mr cook: and the risk of that to the children is so great that they would need – to their psychological, emotional that they would need to be removed? expert: i think it needs to be considered. i think it would need to be considered. mr cook: can i push you higher than considered, or harder than the word considered? expert: i think that if [z] was of an age – if she was a little bit older, i think that my answer to that question would probably be a little bit more definite, but my concern about the impact of attachment disruption to [z] being removed from her mum is a risk that needs to be considered. mr cook: and that’s a greater risk than, perhaps, the difficulties of an ongoing relationship with the father or not? look, i think is the risk of one child higher than the risk to the other three children, for example, and their psychological wellbeing. which – whose wellbeing is most important.[213]
in my experience, it is not unusual for a victim of violence to either not disclose for many years, or to disclose an event and then retract that in fear of that disclosure initially being made. ... so, my experience is that, even if an alleged victim presents to hospital, for example, and they ask specific questions about domestic violence, they may not necessary [sic] divulge that to a clinician at the hospital. and that may occur on several occasions before a victim may eventually disclose violence to a clinician. ... it is about safety with an alleged victim, and fear of retribution, retaliation and so forth. so, those things are really important things to consider when a person thinks about making a disclosure of violence to another person – a clinician.
dr barnett: and so, to take a very specific example, although a victim might have suffered a rape from a perpetrator, them having consensual sex some time later is not necessarily inconsistent with the coercive, controlling nature of the whole relationship? expert: sorry, can you repeat that again? sorry, my apologies. dr barnett: certainly. so, taking a very specific example of rape, if it is – an incident occurred of rape – expert: right dr barnett: - and it is within a coercive and controlling dynamic, relationship – expert: right. dr barnett: - and then, some time later, that relationship continues and there is consensual sex? expert: thereafter? dr barnett: thereafter? expert: right. dr barnett: that doesn’t mean – well, first off, that could very well be some placating behaviour on the part of the victim to the perpetrator to try to keep, you know – expert: right, understood. yes. dr barnett: - calm waters, if i can put it that way? expert: yes. dr barnett: do you accept that? expert: it could be, yes. dr barnett: and although one looking at the victim having sex with her abuser appears illogical, in the greater framework of a coercive, controlling relationship, it is actually understandable. do you accept that? expert: it could be understandable. it’s the same thing as an outsider not understanding why the alleged victim could not leave the relationship. it’s akin to that. dr barnett: yes. and i will ask you a question about that. this idea that, if someone who is the victim could leave because they have some financial means, or they could just go to a refuge or those sorts of things, is there a reason that victims of coercive and controlling violence don’t see those opportunities as someone who is outside of the relationship does? expert: yes. dr barnett: what – can you describe that a bit more? expert: yes, sure. so, because it is not about physical violence, it is about the control, the intimidation, the coercion, the domination, the isolation, that alleged victim may not feel like they can go to anyone. also, they would be understanding that if they were to leave, then the threats to that person and their children may increase, and so, there is a danger period post-separation that is well-documented. and that would be a fear for that person being resistant to leave that relationship. dr barnett: and so – and – i won’t take you there, but altobelli in his paper describes that the period of separation, there is a documented increase in risks in some cases post-separation? expert: yes. dr barnett: and that means, even though the parties are no longer together, they’re not living together, that in fact can be quite an acute period of time – expert: yes, as mentioned. yes. dr barnett: - where greater incidents of violence can occur? expert: yes. dr barnett: is that fair to say? expert: yes. dr barnett: and so, taking that in mind, if there is some placating behaviour post-separation, that may very well be the victim trying to minimise possible harm to herself or to the children. do you accept that? expert: it could be, yes. dr barnett: given what we know about the effect on memory of traumatic events, would you accept the proposition that it is not unheard of for victims’ stories of abuse to increase in severity over time after separation, once they start feeling safe and are more willing to articulate and confront their lived experiences? expert: it could be, yes.[214]
dr barnett: now, your impression of [v] was that he was able to speak positively, at times, about his father? expert: yes. dr barnett: that he was able to be negative about his mother? expert: yes. dr barnett: and therefore, you had limited concerns that he was aligned with one or other of the parents? expert: yes. dr barnett: he says – he gives you three wishes at paragraph 113? expert: yes. dr barnett: he wants a perfect girlfriend? expert: yes. dr barnett: he would wish to be a great person? expert: yes. dr barnett: and he wants a good job? expert: yes. dr barnett: now, those three things are pretty consistent with a teenager of his years? expert: i would say so. dr barnett: it certainly didn’t appear that he came into the session with you with an agenda pushed by the mother or any other person? expert: i don’t think so, no. his honour: i think if we add that he wants a perfect girlfriend who loves him for who he is, it is giving a bit more credit to [v]? expert: yes. dr barnett: that’s right? expert: absolutely. dr barnett: now, he says to you – and we went over some of these yesterday. but you would accept that he says his father would hit whoever he was annoyed at? expert: yes. dr barnett: now, that is different to the father’s version of his disciplining – that is, that he did it infrequently, lightly, and it was a mode of disciplining rather than a form of him acting out his annoyance or – his annoyance. do you accept that? expert: that is inconsistent, yes. dr barnett: he says at 104 that the father can’t hurt anyone anymore. and at 108, that he – this is at the bottom of page 37, that he used to be scared of his father, but he is becoming a lot better and he is in a position to protect himself? expert: yes. dr barnett: again, those words are quite inconsistent to the presentation the father gave you about the methods and mode of limited discipline he used on the children. isn’t that right? expert: i would say so. dr barnett: at 104, on page 36, [v] says it sometimes leaves a mark – that it was mainly hitting with his hands, and it would sometimes leave a mark? expert: yes. dr barnett: that is very inconsistent to what the father had told to you about that minor and light tap on bottoms. do you accept that? expert: yes. dr barnett: these concerns raised by [v] are quite significant, would you accept that? expert: yes. dr barnett: that there would be concern for this court, for a child who had his own memories, who didn’t appear aligned, to indicate that he was scared, he had been hurt and marks had been left, and now he can protect himself. those are pretty concerning things, aren’t they? expert: yes. dr barnett: he also seems to indicate that he doesn’t want to leave the siblings behind? expert: yes. dr barnett: was your interpretation of when he said those words that he didn’t want his siblings to be exposed to the same sort of violence that the father had perpetrated on him? expert: yes. dr barnett: that is a pretty concerning comment for an average teenage boy who has the insight, as his honour indicated, about wanting a girl who loves him for himself, or words to that effect? expert: yes. dr barnett: that is a pretty concerning thing, isn’t it? expert: yes. dr barnett: what the impression you got form [v] was that – i would suggest, was that this was not just a strict parent, but that this is a parent who had used inappropriate physical force on him. isn’t that right? expert: yes.[215]
dr barnett: now, did you get the impression that [w] believed the events had occurred that she talked to you about? expert: yes, she strongly believed them. dr barnett: as i understand it, you also see that [w]’s attachment – that she has a strong attachment to her mother. expert: yes. dr barnett: because of [w]’s personality, that mother hen type thing, and because she believes that her father has been violent to her and her siblings, would you accept that, if [w] was to spend time with the father with her siblings, she would feel the need to protect herself and others from the father? expert: yes. dr barnett: do you accept that that may be a huge psychological load for [w]? expert: yes. dr barnett: do you accept that her being removed from her mother’s care, given that strong attachment, will also be a significant psychological load for [w]? expert: yes.[216]
dr barnett: you accept that one of the significant differences between [x]’s version of events and the father’s is whether or not there was any sort of holding – as a sort of strangulation – tight for a period of time as well as the pinching, that is, [x] pinching his father? expert: yes. dr barnett: if his honour finds that [x] has, in broad themes, repeated the allegations to jirt, to the judge in the local court and to you, it’s pretty clear that he, at least, believes that’s what happened. expert: yes. dr barnett: you also record, as i understand it, at paragraph 162, that his play therapist likewise spoke about [x] speaking about this incident. expert: yes, she did. dr barnett: and there is nothing that you saw that indicated that [x]’s version of events had increased in severity – that is, become, you know, had morphed into something else – in either your discussion with his play therapist or what i read out to you just then in the transcript and compared to what he said to you. expert: no. dr barnett: and you would accept that the fact that it has stayed fairly consistent may be an indication that it’s based on a real memory rather than a false one? expert: correct.[217]
dr barnett: you would accept that there is a difference between estrangement – that’s where children reject a parent for a valid reason: abuse or violence is certainly one – versus alienation, where there is a rejection with no sound basis? expert: yes. dr barnett: as i understand your position, you are not able to say whether or not this more significant domestic violence had occurred? expert: correct. dr barnett: but it would be very important to get that right, that is - expert: yes, that is the premise, i think – what this matter relies upon – is that - dr barnett: because - expert: a fundamental issue about whether there has been coercive control and violence is at the forefront, i think, of this matter. dr barnett: because, certainly, if there is some basis for [x] and [w]’s view – and [v]’s view, of their father, it would be significantly detrimental to their mental health and the way they see appropriate interpersonal relationships if they are put into the primary care of someone who has perpetrated violence on them and their mother, do you accept that? expert: yes.[218]
dr barnett: really, when we’re just looking at attachments, it’s normally in a child’s interest for there to be a gradual transition so that (a) attachment can be built up with the person it’s being transferred to and the child can get used to being away from the primary carer, is that right? expert: is ideal. dr barnett: yes. like to suggest to you that [y] – there may be a – there is also a concern regarding her primary attachment being broken. that is, no contact with her mother for three months, do you accept that? expert: yes.[219]
mr schonell: so is it fair to say that it really all comes down to a large measure of whether or not his honour found that there was coercive and controlling violence in the relationship? expert: yes.[220]
mr schonell: firstly, it’s my client’s evidence – and i think it’s agreed – that the mother worked two days every weekend for, i think, 2015 to 2017. so you agree with me on a weekend the father would have to be entirely involved with the parenting of his children? expert: if that was the case, yes. mr schonell: and that was the case? expert: all right. okay.[221] ... mr schonell: so he had four children to care for, correct? expert: yes. mr schonell: and you would agree with me that, when you look through all the [bl contact centre] reports, there is no criticism made of him about his parenting? expert: up – up until the report, i didn’t see any criticism. i understand that that has continued. i haven’t seen any of the reports, other than the one that you showed me this morning, but i have not seen any criticism of the father. mr schonell: right. and you would also agree that, for the eight months post-separation – sorry – over the period of two years between ’15 and ’17, every single weekend for two years. expert: yes. mr schonell: and then we have the eight months post-separation. expert: yes. mr schonell: there appears to be no complaint on the mother’s part about the father’s care of the children, do you agree with that? expert: yes. mr schonell: so, if we look solely at the risks in the mother’s household versus the father’s parenting abilities just in isolation, you would agree with me that the risks in the mother’s household far exceed any concerns about my client caring for the children. if we just look at those two elements? expert: just in terms of the evidence available, there were concerns about the mother’s parenting, yes.[222] ... mr schonell: do you think the mother has the same ability to reflect as the father does? expert: well, i think the mother’s premise is – is solely on the idea that there are risks of harm issues in the father’s care, and that was a substantive narrative that she brought to my assessment. mr schonell: a substantive narrative, yet they still went into his care post-separation for eight months. expert: that’s correct. [223] ... mr schonell: and you agree yesterday you said that, if they do not have a parent who sets boundaries, they are at risk of antisocial behaviour? expert: yes. [224] ... mr schonell: they need a parent who’s not going to parentify the children, do you agree with that? expert: correct. mr schonell: because we know what’s happening with [w], do not we? expert: she is parentified. mr schonell: yes, and you agree, based upon your observations, the father is not a person who’s going to parentify the children, is he? expert: i do not have any evidence that he has done that so far. mr schonell: right. and the concerns, i think, you said for [w] yesterday in her parentification is that the responsibility could lead to future mental health concerns for [w], correct? expert: yes. mr schonell: self-harm? expert: yes. mr schonell: suicide? expert: yes. mr schonell: diagnosis of mental health issues? expert: yes. mr schonell: she has the weight of the world on her little shoulders, does not she? expert: the prognosis for [w] at the time was not – was not good when i saw her.[225] ... mr schonell: now, the concerns, of course, is that the mother will parentify [z] as she gets older, do you agree with that? expert: it’s possible. mr schonell: and, indeed, the same with [y]. expert: look, i think there is a risk for all the children to be parentified in this matter. mr schonell: and, therefore, that is another risk in the mother’s house. expert: it is a risk.[226]
mr schonell: and you’ve seen the minute of order that i’ve given to you? expert: i have. i do have that. ..... yes, i’ve got there here. mr schonell: okay. so you will see what that minute of order is doing is, first of all, we’re getting [ms bj] involved with the transition between households? expert: yes. mr schonell: and, indeed, the thought is that the children go to [ms bj’s] offices. she meets with the children? expert: yes. mr schonell: she explains the orders to the children? expert: yes. mr schonell: and that’s where the transition occurs? expert: okay. mr schonell: okay. so the transition goes from [ms bj] to the father? expert: okay. mr schonell: and what is important for [z], no doubt, is that she maintains a secure attachment to her mother? expert: yes. mr schonell: and you said that she already has a secure attachment to her mother? expert: that was my impression, yes. mr schonell: so there’s not a concern that we’re dealing with a child that has an insecure attachment. it’s she has already got a secure attachment, we just want to ensure we maintain it? expert: correct. mr schonell: okay. and so do you agree with me that in order to maintain that attachment we need to ensure she’s spending relatively regular weekly time with the mother? expert: that will be ideal. mr schonell: and we know that at the moment she spends days during the week in care? expert: how many days a week. mr schonell: five days a week? expert: five days a week. mr schonell: and that the proposal from the father, as you can see there, is that he would, therefore, have from after day care on the monday through to after day care on the friday whereupon the mother would pick up [z] from day care, have a whole weekend with her – expert: yes. mr schonell: - return her to day care and so that the father’s – the disruption for [z] is significantly less? expert: right. okay. mr schonell: can you see some benefits with that approach? expert: i do. the only thing i want to add to that is – is a couple of things. so if – if the court were to make orders to this effect i would probably suggest that the father meet with [ms bj] prior to so that she can have an opportunity to speak to [mr bergeron] and talk to him about how the events will unfold and give him just some initial information and support - mr schonell: yes? expert: - about that, so that will be my first issue, i think, that could be added to that. the other thing is my only concern is is that if – you know, obviously, the father is making some significant allegations about the mother’s, you know, capacity to refrain from making unsubstantiated allegations, and that – and that’s a long-term issue. that’s what he’s suggesting. if that was - mr schonell: well, no, pausing there. that would be consistent with what the evidence is in relation to, for example – and i don’t want to use alienation, but the way she has conducted herself in relation to encouraging the relationship between the father and the child? expert: okay. so what i want to add – what i want to add, then, is that if this order was to be executed, if it was the case that [z] started spending time with her mother on that weekend and [z] started to perhaps make comments about abuse or negative other comments about her family i think that it will be really important to have something in place so that the father could cease that weekend time with the father – with the mother and [z]. mr schonell: good. okay. thank you. and that would, then, occur for a period of three months? expert: yes. mr schonell: and then we would see the regime which was our original alternate weekend time with the mother? expert: yes, yes. mr schonell: now, based upon your clinical experience – and i accept there was an involvement with the family quite some time ago, but do you feel that, firstly, the three month circuit-breaker for the other three is sufficient for the father to be able to reset their view of him? expert: i – i think it’s reasonable and – and pretty on par with what would be expected in – in – in such a case where there might be a change of residence in - mr schonell: good? expert: - these circumstances. mr schonell: and, equally, do you think – because of your concern with [z] do you think that weekend – those solid weekend blocks with mum every weekend is sufficient to maintain that attachment but also form a bond with dad before we get to the – expert: yes. mr schonell: - alternate weekend? expert: yes. mr schonell: we do? expert: that’s okay. mr schonell: thank you. expert: that – that will be okay. it’s – mr schonell: yes? expert: well, you know, it – there – there are obviously extreme circumstances, but – mr schonell: sure. expert: - you know, i think we need to put things in place as appropriate, and that – mr schonell: yes expert: - would be okay. mr schonell: lovely. and, of course, the benefits to the children of these orders are they will be primarily with a parent who, firstly, doesn’t parentify them, that’s a yes? expert: yes. mr schonell: he’s emotionally available? expert: yes. mr schonell: he will support the relationship with the other parent? expert: i think he’s more likely to do so than the mother. mr schonell: right. well, we certainly know that’s not going to be the case with the mother, i think you – expert: yes. mr schonell: - would agree with that, and the orders also see all the children together other than [v], but we accept [v] – well, i will come to [v] in a minute, but they’re all together? expert: yes. mr schonell: right. ultimately. although you would agree with me, given [v]’s age, he’s at a point in time with his life where he may spread his wings and leave the house, in any event? expert: yes. mr schonell: right. and the benefit of these orders is they see the children having a relationship with both parents? expert: yes. mr schonell: and that’s of critical significance, do you agree with that? expert: agreed. mr schonell: because the mother’s orders would, in effect, see no relationship with the father, you would agree with that, wouldn’t you? expert: the three eldest wouldn’t have a relationship, and i – you know, i question the – the quality of the relationship if they were to spend just some supervised time with their father.
his honour: all right. if i could just ask you this? expert: sure. his honour: paragraph 122 of your report on page 40. it’s [w] and we’re starting at the bottom of page 40:
when she gets into trouble from her father her father gets angry and starts hurting and when [x] would not go to bed dad pushed him over, stomped on his chest area and threw him against the door. she said [x] had a bruise on his forehead and a bump on his head, and that’s when all this talking started.
his honour: i asked you yesterday if it was your impression that [w] was talking about the incident in august 2018 - expert: yes. his honour: - that led to the vast change in this whole matter and the ceasing of the children going over in sets and not all at once to see their father, and i think you indicated that your impression was that [w] was talking about that incident? expert: i – i – i think it is in referring to that incident, but again, i think part of it may be related to other instances as well because i – i – as i – and i think when – when [w] was speaking to me it did appear quite consistently that several events were kind of merged into one, and so it was really hard to delineate which one was a specific incident, which one was another incident and so forth. so i – i think that that comment also is partly related to that incident in august 2018 but may also be snippets of something else. his honour: so you don’t see any significance in [w] relating that and saying she was behind the door, and if it did relate to the august 2018 incident we know that [w] simply wasn’t there at the time? expert: yes, well, i asked her about that incident there, and she said she – that was in relation to that incident in august 2018. she said that she was behind the door. his honour: she said she was behind the door? expert: yes. his honour: all right. if the evidence, including the evidence of the mother, is that [w] was not present – that was a weekend when [y] and [x] went to spend time with their father – does [w] asserting that she was behind the door when that incident occurred – does that – do you draw anything from that in relation to the whole of [w]’s narrative to you of her father’s conduct? expert: i do and i do recall asking her about that because i wanted to know how she knew that information, and she said that she was there, and i do recall, from the information prior to reading with – you know, before meeting with [w], that she was not there. his honour: all right. is there anything that you draw from that you can tell me – expert: look, i think - - - his honour: - from [w] insisting she was there – expert: she wasn’t. his honour: - when she wasn’t? expert: i mean, she - his honour: yes, but – expert: - wasn’t there, and the – the – so, you know, that draws into, i guess, the thought process that there is – there has been, i think, narratives in the household – ongoing talk about incidences that have occurred in the family, and i think the children, in particular, [w] has drawn on those events in some way and has kind of put them together in some way, and this has become her version of reality.
the balance of the exhibits
a25 – bl contact centre report dated 6 february 2021
based on my earlier observation, i asked [y] if she wanted to see her dad. she didn’t answer the question and was evasive. she walked to the other side of the table and said, “he hurts everybody”. i asked what she meant, and who said that. she didn’t answer and looked at [w]. when [ms bergeron] returned with [x], i told her i could take both children if she wanted me to. [y] didn’t object, and [z] appeared happy. [ms bergeron] said both children would attend, and we all crossed the road to get [y]’s jumper from [ms bergeron’s] car. i asked [ms bergeron] if we could meet 15 minutes later to compensate for the late start due to the venue change. she said no, as they had other plans.[227]
... when the girls saw [mr bergeron] coming, they grew excited. i reminded them to wait until i turned off the engine before undoing their seatbelts. i parked, and [mr bergeron] came to the car. [y] climbed out and jumped up to hug [mr bergeron]. when i released [z]’s seatbelt, she ran to [mr bergeron], saying, “daddy, daddy, daddy,” and insisted he pick her up, too. [mr bergeron] picked her up and carried both of the children into the play centre. ... [mr bergeron] played with the girls in the lower section, where i was able to observe the interaction. both girls laughed a lot and appeared to have great fun. neither child seemed fearful when interacting with him.[228]
a27 – bl contact centre report dated 7 march 2021
... [w] walked over soon after, we greeted and i apologised for being late. i asked her how she was feeling about the visit and she said that she was not attending. i said it was my job to help her and it would assist if i understood her reasons. [w] became very agitated and teary and said that she did not want to discuss it. she said that she had lost one and a half to two hours just to come and say she wasn’t attending, which is what she has said for the last three years. she asked that [bl contact centre] should stop organising the visits. i advised [w] that [bl contact centre] are organising the visits at the request of her parent/s and that as long as her parent/s book the visits, [bl contact centre] will send a worker to meet with her and ask her if she wants to attend. i said she should speak to [ms bergeron] and she said she has told [ms bergeron], [mr bergeron] and [bl contact centre] repeatedly that she will not attend. i explained that: ... i haven’t been in the situation but that i can only imagine how annoyed she is that she hasn’t been heard and, on top of everything, i was late. [w] became teary again. she said that she was stressed rather than annoyed, and that me being late had added to her stress. [w] said it is not safe, and she had spent more time with [mr bergeron] than she wanted to, and she does not want to see him ever again.[229]
r7 and a24 – the mother’s assertions of inaccuracies in the expert’s report
dr barnett: ma’am, do you recall being asked some questions about some inaccuracies in the single expert report – have you prepared a document which indicates some of the inaccuracies you say are found within that report? mother: yes. dr barnett: can i show you a document? i note, your honour, that this document was provided this morning to my friends. is that a copy of the document that you prepared? mother: yes. dr barnett: and that shows it’s the title single expert report – inaccuracies noted by ms bergeron? mother: yes.

...with respect to the expert ... i provided a bundle of social science research of some matters that i would be proposing to put to the expert with respect to things like domestic violence and parental alienation syndrome, and those sorts of things.
icl3 – icl’s costs
submissions
submissions for the icl
i will give my learned friends more time, but your honour will see in the rest of the icl’s case outline that there’s an extract of the paragraph and the paragraphs identified which support the position that the children should live with the father. please the court.
there are some matters, and largely, despite a whole range of people being called, we say that the dispute in large part is a he said/she said, and they should – those claims and counterclaims should be seen against a background of a couple of matters. the first is that the parties negotiated an amicable – well, perhaps not now, but at the time an amicable separation between them, and that was in december 2017. and between december 2017 and late august 2018, despite the fact that, on the mother’s evidence, the father had raped her, had bashed her and had bashed the children and coerced her, she was content to have, to use the father’s phrase, the children live with [mr bergeron] – “lived with [ms bergeron] and with the father spent time with some of the children for most of the nights”. and that’s found in the family report at paragraph 10.[233]
...put in the care of the father by the mother, despite all of these allegations she makes against him. in my respectful submission, difficult to find any rational explanation if the father was the monster that the mother makes out in her case. if he was that, why would these children be put in his care?[234]
submissions for the father and the mother  in short, not only was she an untruthful witness, but she was duplicitous, scheming, and actively sought to mislead the court as to the true nature of the parties [sic] relationship and her allegations of abuse. [10] the father’s evidence was direct, forthright and unwavering. where it was appropriate to make concessions, he did so. the father was composed and calm, not aggressive or easily angered, despite the significant allegations being put to him ...[235]
most perpetrators of coercive, controlling family violence would minimise, deny, or blame others, and [mr bergeron’s] attitude is not consistent with the perpetrator of coercive, controlling violence.[236]  ] the father’s credit is significantly undermined in circumstances where he has indicated to the local court that he had not hit the children, evidence given under oath in aid of his acquittal with respect to the charges brought against him for the allegations arising from the disclosure and bruising of the child [x].  ] his explanation regarding the difference between a hit and a smack is nonsensical when it was put to him by counsel for the mother early on the first day that he had hit the children and he accepted as much. indeed, he was taken through each child as to the last time he had hit them, and he provided a response estimating the last time he had so hit them.  ] this explanation does not make sense. he is an educated man who answered the questions about being hit, without any difficulty. the conclusion the court must find is that he purposely indicated to the local court that he did not hit the children to improve his case. it is submitted that this significantly undermines his credit. his explanation to try and draw a distinction must significantly impact on the veracity of his evidence, particularly with respect to the allegations of violence.  ] ... it is submitted that being an inaccurate historian may be a side-effect of the trauma she has survived.
and pointed out that the single expert agreed with such a possibility during cross-examination.  ] the contrary conduct of the mother, both before separation and post-separation, seemingly inconsistent with her asserted horrendous treatment by the father, needs to be seen in the social science understanding of appeasement by victims to their perpetrators, and the protectiveness some victims have for the family unit even when it is one marked by violence and abuse.  ] it is accepted that the younger children have a warm and loving relationship with their father and that it is likely that their only memory of him is through time spent under supervision, however, [y] has brought up some memories regarding what she says occurred to her by the father. the single expert indicated concern regarding the veracity of those memories, and there is certainly evidence that [x] has, within the family home, spoken about his experience and fear of the father, to which [y] was exposed.
... a very difficult personal dynamic and that it doesn’t actually hold weight when one looks at what we now know about domestic violence ... your honour has the tender bundle which at least has some social science articles which speaks about the pattern of coercion, control, the cycle of violence ...[238]
turning to what your honour may or may not be able to find, there is always a difficulty in making findings of fact and, in my submission, this is probably another case where your honour may have difficulties in making findings of fact as to what actually occurred. but the real question, as your honour is directed to by the high court, is whether it is an analysis of risk. and that analysis of risk, in my submission, is one where your honour takes into account the complaints made by the children, particularly [v], but not putting to one side those made by [w], noting, of course, that there is concern regarding [w]’s relationship being exposed to things in the family. you would take into account the concerns raised by [x], particularly, the incident in august 2018. your honour would take into account my client’s significant number of allegations she makes, some of which are supported by the contemporaneous records, and your honour would find that this is not – as seemed to be accepted by the single expert – this is not a situation of alienation, but this is an occasion where the mother is trying her best in a very difficult scenario, including her own vulnerabilities, to keep herself and the children safe, and it’s certainly, in my submission, very clear that once there was an incident – and, in my submission, the mother explained this – once there was an incident in august 2018, she realised that her hope that if they’re in two households and there is more space and temporarily separated – and your honour would see that [v]’s view was that, when they separated, it was only for a bit, so they all got a bit more space – her hope was that her experience and how she has seen the father parent the children with force wouldn’t erupt, but that hope was dashed when [x] came home and indicated and clearly had bruises from an incident that occurred in the father’s household. what flows from that is, if your honour finds that there is an unacceptable risk to the children, is that putting them in the father’s care in those circumstances would be unsafe and your honour would not do so.[239]
...what we have left is a father on his own with the possibility his mother might come, his mother, who he accepted in cross-examination, only spent one night or two with all of them in the house because of a complaint regarding the noise and/or the bed in which she slept in, with no support structures in place and the possibility of [ms bj] being able to do some family therapy, with no indication of frequency of that therapy, and certainly no availability for [ms bj] to be in the home.[240]
his honour: on the other side of the coin, if the court goes with the mother’s proposals, isn’t that, for practical purposes, the end of the relationship between father and [w], father and [x], unless either of those two children make their own decision to revisit the relationship at some time in the future? dr barnett: yes, i accept that, your honour, absolutely ...[241]

mr schonell: ... your honour, i’m concerned the witness is - his honour: yes. mr schonell: - perhaps not in the best state of mind to continue. his honour: and you’ve indicated that your mind has gone a blank. you don’t seem to be doing too well. what i’m going to do is adjourn briefly, and let you have a short talk to your counsel and your solicitor, and then we will come back into the room, all right? and when we come back into the room if you would take a seat behind your counsel, and ms barnett, if you will just make your own decision – dr barnett: yes. his honour: - as to whether you think [ms bergeron] is in a state to continue her evidence this afternoon, and then i will hear from you.[242]
mr schonell: well, ma’am, you gave details such as – and you don’t need to go there – at the bottom of paragraph 126 “i remember staring up at the crack between the wall and the architrave where the paint had not reached and followed the cobwebs on the ceiling with my eyes”? mother: yes, that’s dissociation. mr schonell: right. you agree with me that’s a very detailed account of what happened? mother: no, that’s staring at something in space when i’m trying not to focus on what’s actually happening. mr schonell: ma’am, are you trying to be difficult? mother: no. i dissociated the last time we were in court. i stared at that piece there to try and get away from what was actually happening internally. i stared at that little crack there, that’s what i did.[243]
there is a difference between the rejection of a person’s evidence and a finding that he or she deliberately lied.[244]
section 60cc – the primary considerations
the phrase “meaningful relationship” in the context of s 60cc(3)(a) has, not surprisingly, been considered in a number of decisions since the introduction of the amending act. in mazorski & albright [2007] famca 520, (2007) 37 fam lr 518 brown j, after setting out the definition of “meaningful” and “meaning”, said at paragraph 26:
what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.

[v] said that he does not know why his mother wants to cut his father out of his life, and that his father “is not the complete monster he’s made out to be”, and that, “a few actions do not determine him.” ... he said that the part he likes least about his mother is that, “i do not like how she’s obviously alienating dad,” as, “she’s just keeping all the bad parts of him.”

to:
when asked about spending time with her father, [w] responded with, “only once he learns ..., i do not want dad that horrible, i want to live a normal life, i want to be a great singer.”
and then back to:   reported that there is nothing that her father can do to repair their relationship as, “he’s gone past the point where he needs to apologise.”
unfortunately, the next line in the expert’s report on [w] is:
her mother has told her that it is her choice
which is totally inappropriate for a child of nine years of age. [w] has been making it her choice, fortnight after fortnight and then month after month, when presented for time with her father in accordance with the interim orders and asked by the supervisors from bl contact centre if she will attend.   was asked to consider the judge making orders for her to spend time with her father, [w] said, “i do not know what i’d do, i wouldn’t be able to see mummy, my mummy is everything, she comforts me, my family would be ruined.”
her father threw her into her bedroom and locked her in her room until her mother got home, and that he threw a glass cup that shattered on the floor, causing her to hurt her foot when she stepped on it.

it may be contended that the mother’s contributions were made significantly more arduous due to the family violence she endured (kennon & kennon [1997] famca 27, [1997] flc 92-757).  ] in or around the same time, i received a phone call from [mr bergeron] and he said, ‘i spoke to the mortgage adviser to see what our options were for a mortgage. after telling them you would loan us money, they told me they would not agree to loaning us money with an existing encumbrance of a loan to me. can you make a statutory declaration that the money was a gift to [ms bergeron] and me so the bank does not think we have a further loan to you? this obviously does not affect our intention to pay you back. it’s just so the bank does not think we have another loan.’  ] i felt very uncomfortable with this request but agreed to do it as a gift to [ms bergeron] alone.  ] on 11 april 2013, i sent [mr bergeron] the statutory declaration dated as requested, saying the money was a gift and not a loan, and then began transferring moneys to [ms bergeron] and [mr bergeron’s] joint bank to be used towards the purchase of the [bc street, suburb bd] property.
hi, [ms bergeron]. loans: - assuming you have kept up with the loan and interest repayments to your mum, the moving and car loan should be at gbp 12,728.26. - the main house loan, which was interest only, is at gbp 250,000. ...
mr schonell: right. now, you say that, in 2013, “[mr bergeron] and [ms bergeron] told me they had bought a house in [bc street, suburb bd].” do you remember that? maternal grandmother: i was part of all of that. mr schonell: yes. no, you have been very generous. do you remember there was an amount of £170,000 that you originally loaned to them on 24 april – or thereabouts – 2013? maternal grandmother: yes. mr schonell: and then you would agree with me that, around 2014, there was a refinance of the house and you also advanced a further £80,000? maternal grandmother: yes, correct. mr schonell: and that was at a time when you swore a stat dec saying that it was a gift rather than a loan? maternal grandmother: yes. [mr bergeron] asked me to do that and said they couldn’t go ahead with the purchase unless i did it, so i - i think i have said i didn’t want to do it, but i did it because i thought the house would fall through. mr schonell: and the agreement was, though, from that point in time, that it would be an interest-only obligation? in other words, they only had to pay you interest on the amount. do you agree with that? maternal grandmother: yes. that’s all in [mr bergeron’s] emails to me. mr schonell: yes, and there was no obligation to repay the principal. it was an obligation to - maternal grandmother: no. he says in there, “can we start there and then we will change it to the capital.” mr schonell: and what i’m saying to you is the agreement was, after that, that there would be repayments of interest but there was no requirement to pay the principal back? maternal grandmother: no. that was – that’s wrong. mr schonell: okay. maternal grandmother: what i suggest is interest only until we can afford to pay the repayments for a 15-year mortgage. mr schonell: okay. and, if they couldn’t afford to pay it back, you wouldn’t enforce it upon them. would that be fair enough? maternal grandmother: no. he says they will sell [by street] instead. mr schonell: no, no, no. i’m talking about now. if they were unable to repay the debt, you wouldn’t enforce the repayment of the debt? maternal grandmother: that was never contemplated. mr schonell: no, no. ma’am, i’m asking you now that you wouldn’t enforce the repayment of the debt, would you? maternal grandmother: i haven’t got to that point.
so what we can afford today is $619(bank) + $242(loan from you), which is $861 a week or, roughly, our current rent. we are hoping we can repay at the 15yr or 20yr mortgage rate within the next few years, the extra money would come from my salary increasing (working in finance again), [ms bergeron] getting a job or as the last resort selling [by street]. so what i am suggesting is interest only until we can afford to pay the repayments of a 15 year mortgage, but if we cannot afford the repayments within five years we would sell [by street] instead. so that means a maximum time of 20 years with a chance we won’t have to sell in the uk. we can talk about it later on skype or via email if you prefer.
dr barnett: she [maternal grandmother] annexes at annexure b to her affidavit an email sent on 24 january 2012. have you read that email? father: i’ve read the annexures. i cannot remember which one that is, though. dr barnett: [a copy is shown to the father] do you see the date being 24 january 2012? father: yes. dr barnett: do you see the subject is “loan”? father: yes. dr barnett: do you see that, at the bottom, it is – sorry, at the top it says, “hi, [ms bf]”? father: yes. i see that, yes. dr barnett: and then at the bottom it says “[ms bergeron] and [mr bergeron]”? father: that’s right. yes. dr barnett: now, this is an email that you composed? father: yes. to [ms bergeron], yes. sorry. to [ms bergeron]. sorry. dr barnett: sorry. i do not understand that. father: i sent from me to [ms bergeron] is with the emails, yes. dr barnett: right. and in the body of this, that is looking where you’re requesting to borrow £20,000. father: that’s right. yes. dr barnett: right. so, as i understand it, you and [ms bergeron] were seeking to borrow £20,000 at three per cent interest from my client’s mother. is that right? father: that’s right. yes.[252] ... dr barnett: and [ms bf] did provide funds to you and [ms bergeron]? father: she did, yes. dr barnett: and the rent from the [by street] property were used to repay those funds to maternal grandmother. isn’t that right? father: that’s right. yes.[253] ... dr barnett: and these funds were utilised by you and [ms bergeron] upon your relocation to australia? father: yes. that was the purpose, yes.[254]
dr barnett: now, if you could turn to the next – sorry. if you just turn to page 29. now, you accept that this is an email composed by yourself to [ms bf]? father: that’s right, yes. dr barnett: dated 25 june 2014? father: yes. dr barnett: and if you can read the body of the affidavit, this is with respect to seeking to borrow funds of £10,000. do you accept that? father: yes. dr barnett: now, you indicate here that, “we could take 3500 from the repayment account.” do you see those words? father: yes. dr barnett: now, the repayment account was the money where the funds from [by street] – that is, the rent from [by street] – was deposited. isn’t that right? father: it was one of [ms bergeron’s] accounts which i didn’t have any visibility of, but i assume so. that would make sense. dr barnett: and you’ve indicated in this email that you hadn’t paid fully the £20,000, and so, with the further provision of £10,000, the amount that would be owed would be £26,254.35? father: yes. dr barnett: and what you – you’re indicating there is that £26,254 needs to be repaid if she provided you with an extra £10,000? father: yes. dr barnett: and, indeed, she did provide you with a further £10,000? father: yes.[255]
dr barnett: and it’s true, isn’t it, that you and the mother would not have been able to purchase the [bc street, suburb bd] property without a provision of funds from [ms bf]. father: that’s right. yes.[256]
dr barnett: you sent an email on 30 march 2018 where you clearly indicate that the money to [ms bf] needs to be repaid. do you recall sending that email? father: well, i sent that email. yes. dr barnett: and the reason you sent that email is because the agreement between you and [ms bf] and [ms bergeron] is that the $500,000 needed to be repaid. isn’t that right? father: so it changed after we had bought the house. and the change was, i was informed by [ms bergeron], that it was now an interest-only loan where we do not have to repay the principal. dr barnett: and the fact is, is that the agreement at the time the money was provided was that money was a loan. isn’t that right? father: the agreement at the time was that it was a gift, yes. dr barnett: and it has always been the situation that that money needs to be repaid, isn’t that correct? father: i think very quickly after the gift was made it turned back into a loan between [ms bergeron] and [ms bf]. dr barnett: and so, when you depose in your affidavit that that money was a gift, and you do not indicate that shortly after the money was provided it was indeed a loan, you’re not telling his honour the full truth, are you? father: i was telling what i could – i had evidence for. i didn’t have the conversation between [ms bergeron] and [ms bf]. dr barnett: but nowhere in your affidavit do you depose this conversation that you had with [ms bergeron] where she clearly indicates that the principal of 500,000 needs to be repaid, do you? father: that’s right. it’s not in my affidavit. dr barnett: and certainly the case that your – as i understand it, your case here to his honour is that the 500,000 does not need to be repaid. is that right? father: so i was actually leaving it up to the judge to decide. i just wanted to get the facts on the table.[257]
dr barnett: ... in your – in this email, you’re indicating that there is a loan of £250,000. isn’t that right? father: that’s what i’ve said, yes. dr barnett: and you indicate there that it’s interest only. isn’t that right? father: yes. yes, that’s what i’ve said. dr barnett: which indicates that a payment is being made with respect to the provision of those funds. isn’t that right? father: yes. dr barnett: and that payment was being made from the rent of the property at [by street]? father: that’s my understanding, yes. dr barnett: and so again your assertion to this court that that money was a gift is contradicted by the fact that interest payments were being made, as far as you were aware, on the provision of those funds. isn’t that right? father: so it was a gift at the time and it changed back to an interest-only loan. dr barnett: the difficulty, though, sir, is that you’ve left out the part where it went back to being a loan. isn’t that right? father: that’s not in my affidavit. i agree. yes.[258] ... dr barnett: so where you say, “[ms bergeron] has continued to receive all the rental income from the uk property,” nowhere do you indicate that that financial assistance – sorry, that financial benefit she has been receiving is limited because she has been repaying a joint debt. isn’t that right? father: that’s not in the affidavit. i agree, yes.[259]
dr barnett: in 2014, [ms bf] provided a further sum of $50,000 to purchase [[c] pty ltd] shares. isn’t that right? father: that’s not correct.[260]  4] as part of my employment with [[c] pty ltd], i was granted shares on 3 may 2012. i thereafter purchased further shares on 4 december 2012 and 31 december 2014. to date, we have sold $474,000 (as discussed below) ...

(“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”, (4) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.   second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, (3) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ...

... indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis (1986) 161 clr 513).[271]  ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial “product” or “value”. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent “causal connection” might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the “...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...” or, indeed, to “property” at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to:
... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse’s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[272]  8] ...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.  9] as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.
kennon v kennon
put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79. we prefer this approach to the concept of “negative contributions” which is sometimes referred to in this discussion.
the incidence of domestic violence in a marriage would generally be a relevant factor when the court comes to assess contributions pursuant to the provisions of s 79 for the reason that the contributions made by a party who has suffered domestic violence at the hands of the other party may be all the more onerous because of that violence and therefore attract additional weight.[274]  ] the full court in kennon & kennon [1997] famca 27, (1997) flc 92-757 said the following: put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, to put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79. [69] in s & s [2003] famca 905 the full court referred to the above passage in kennon and emphasised the words “which is demonstrated“ saying: the question is whether a trial judge may infer from the evidence that the result must be that a party’s contributions have been affected. [70] the full court in kennon went on to say that considerations of this nature only apply in a relatively narrow band of cases and that it was not directed at conduct which does not have that effect and, of necessity, it usually did not encompass conduct proximate to the breakdown of the marriage basically because there would be insufficient time for any impact to be relevant to contributions. [71] in s & s, the full court approved a statement by the trial judge, when the trial judge had commented on the difficulty in that case which arose from the wife’s material, because although it gave evidence about specific acts of violence, it did not expressly refer to the impact of the violence on her contributions. the trial judge went on to say: it cannot, however, be the law that the failure to state such matters expressly is necessarily fatal to such evidence, there must be cases where it is obvious or a very likely inference from the facts, that certain kinds of violence must have adversely affected a person’s contributions. [72] the full court in s & s also commented upon the reference to “exceptional cases“ and “the relatively narrow band of cases“. the full court in s & s adopted the trial judge’s comments that: ... the references to “exceptional cases“ and “narrow band of cases“ occurs in the context of the principle of misconduct in general rather than the more narrow formulation about domestic violence. my reading of these passages, therefore, is that it is not necessarily correct that only cases of exceptional violence or a narrow band of domestic violence cases fall within the principles. it seems to me that reading these passages carefully, the key words in a case where there are allegations of domestic violence are “significant adverse impact” and “discernible impact“. that reading of the passage is, i think, given some additional force by the actual decision in the doherty case and the judgments of baker j in both doherty and kennon. [73] the full court in s & s at [47] said: an insufficiency of evidence in the present case leaves the court with a limited ability to deal with allegations in the context of section 79 proceedings. as kennon has established, it is necessary to provide evidence to establish: the incidence of domestic violence, the effect of domestic violence, and evidence to enable the court to quantify the effect of that violence upon the parties [sic] capacity to “contribute“ as defined by section 79(4).  ] ... we struggle to understand what that “quantification” evidence might be beyond that given by the victim spouse as to the incidence and effect of the violence as identified in [s v s] in the first two dot points at [47]. furthermore, we fail to see how this third step accords with the decision in kennon which the full court in [s v s] said governed the situation. perhaps the use of the word “quantification” is infelicitous and has unintentionally added a gloss to the ratio in kennon, when in truth, the court in [s v s] was merely reinforcing the need for there to be an evidentiary nexus between the conduct complained of and the capacity (or effort expended) to make relevant contributions. and, depending upon the nature of the violence established, in the absence of express evidence about the effect that violence had on the victim spouse’s contributions, how difficult it might be for the court to draw inferences which would establish the evidentiary nexus (see [s v s] at [42])...  ] even though s v s might, in the past, have been interpreted as implying the need for something more, it should now be clear that the required nexus between proven family violence and the significant adverse effect upon the contributions of the victim is capable of being inferred from the lay evidence of the parties (maine v maine [2016] famcafc 270, (2016) 56 fam lr 500, britt v britt [2017] famcafc 27, (2017) 56 fam lr 526, (2017) flc 93-764, [2017] at [74]–[75], keating at [27]–[43], [52]–[67]).  ] here, the primary judge found the appellant perpetrated family violence upon the respondent and drew an inference that such violence did have an effect upon the respondent’s contributions, making them “all the more arduous” (at [162]). an inference is an assent to the existence of a fact which is based on the proven existence of some other fact or facts, drawn as part of the fact finding process as an exercise of ordinary powers of deduction and reason in the light of human experience, unaffected by any rule of law (g v h [1994] hca 48, (1994) 181 clr 387 at 390, [1994] hca 48, 124 alr 353 at 355, [1994] hca 48, 18 fam lr 180 at 182). obviously, the strength of the subject inference depends upon the quality of the underlying evidence. it must be reasonable to draw the inference from primary facts. mere conjecture will not suffice (seltsam pty ltd v mcguiness (2000) 49 nswlr 262, [2000] nswca 29 at [80]–[101] per spigelman cj, carr v baker [1936] nswstrp 20, (1936) 36 sr (nsw) 301 at 306–7 per jordan cj). importantly, the evaluation of the evidence from which the subject inference is sought to be drawn should be thorough and balanced. in the context of a kennon argument, any factual controversies over the alleged misconduct of one spouse and its alleged deleterious consequential effects upon the other spouse should be resolved by familiar forensic techniques. disputed but untested allegations, are not facts (keating at [55]–[66]).  ] the central question raised by this appeal is how a judge takes into account the contributions of one party, found to have been made significantly more arduous by the conduct of the other, when assessing contributions under s 79(4)(a)–(c) or s 90sm(4)(a)–(c) of the act. the answer is the primary judge must take a holistic approach. the contributions which have been made significantly more arduous have to be weighed along with all other contributions by each of the parties, whether financial or non-financial, direct or indirect to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of property and in the role of homemaker and parent. all contributions must be weighed collectively and so it is an error to segment or compartmentalise the various contributions and weigh one against the remainder (jabour v jabour (2019) 59 fam lr 475, (2019) flc 93-898, [2019] famcafc 78 at [73]–[87] (jabour), horrigan and horrigan [2020] famcafc 25 at [42]–[48]). [36] that principle has its counterpart in the application of factors prescribed by s 75(2) or s 90sf(3) of the act (in the marriage of j d and s j tomasetti (2000) 26 fam lr 114, (2000) flc 93-023, [2000] famca 314 at [107]–[114]). any adjustment to the parties’ contribution-based entitlements should be determined inclusively after considering all relevant factors, not by aggregating incremental adjustments in respect of each relevant factor. [37] although the use of the short-hand descriptor of a “kennon claim” is not of itself erroneous, it is liable to induce error because the issue is not a stand-alone claim, but is rather integral to the entire process (paysen v laukien (2020) 60 fam lr 464, (2020) flc 93-960, [2020] famcafc 101 at [48]–[50]). nor is it helpful to refer to the issue as a “kennon adjustment” because that epithet invites treatment of the issue as an isolated claim for an additional share of the available property.
addbacks ] to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are: (a) where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm v jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) 23 fam lr 396 the full court said (at 410-411):
11.6 for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out.   where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in in marriage of townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said (at 509):
in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly.   in the circumstances outlined by baker j in in marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70, [1981] flc 91-092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. conduct of the kind referred to in para. (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under sec 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of sec 79. [31] as the full court said in browne v green [1999] famca 1483, [1999] flc 92-873 at 86,360:  ] we agree with her honour that the principles stated by baker j in kowaliw certainly do not constitute any form of fixed code. they are no more than guidelines for use in the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction conferred by s 79 of the family law act 1975. nevertheless, they have over the considerable period of time since they were enunciated, become a well accepted guideline in this jurisdiction — a guideline the use of which assists in the achievement of the important goal of consistency within the jurisdiction.[275]  ] where one party unilaterally distributes to themselves property which no longer exists and which, but for that premature distribution, would be susceptible to section 79 orders, justice and equity may require the court to take account of the dissipated property by adding it back as against the dissipating party (townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569). whether that should occur, or whether the dissipation should be taken into account pursuant to section 75(2)(o), or indeed at all, are all matters requiring the exercise of a trial judge’s discretion (in the marriage of ad and ac townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569, ajo & gro, c & c [1998] famca 143).  7] at [50] to [65] of the first reasons under the heading “add-backs,” the trial judge held that $25,000 withdrawn by the husband from the parties’ bank accounts post-separation should be added back into the pool of assets, and further concluded that $50,000 which the husband had, post-separation, paid to his parents, purportedly in repayment of a loan from them, should also be added back. [138] there is no error committed per se in adjusting the parties’ actual property interests by a calculation involving notionally adding back into the pool sums which have been dissipated by the parties. we reject any suggestion that the decision of bevan & bevan [2013] famcafc 116, (2013) flc 93-545 – or, more particularly, the decision of the high court in stanford & stanford [2012] hca 52, (2012) 247 clr 108 - is authority for any necessary contrary solution. some statements made by the high court may lead to the conclusion that references to “notional property” as have been referred to in decisions of this court and at first instance may need to be reconsidered. [139] the decisions referred to seek to remind the court that, however the exercise of discretion might seek to deal with property that is said to be the subject of “add back”, proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property, and the question posed by s 79(2) as a separate inquiry from any adjustment to property interests by reference to s 79(4) if a consideration of s 79(2) reveals that it is just and equitable to alter existing interests in property.[277]  ] we observe that “notional property”, which is sometimes “added back” to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute “property of the parties to the marriage or either of them”, and thus is not amenable to alteration under section 79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage – and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that section 79(4) and in particular section 75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property.[278]  ] ... the way in which non-existent property is to be treated remains a matter for judicial discretion (see townsend & townsend flc 92-569) ... the provision of an agreed balance sheet providing for the inclusion of notional property would not mandate his honour’s acceptance of it or that he would treat the notional property in the same way as had the parties.  0] ... a court cannot create property for the purposes of alteration. section 79 empowers a court to alter interests of the parties to the proceedings in property. property is defined in section 4 of the act to mean:
... [in] relation to the parties to a marriage or either of them – means property to which those parties are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or reversion.  1] as french cj said in kennon & spry [2008] hca 56, (2008) 238 clr 366 at 390, “‘property’ in section 79 is to be read as part of the collocation ‘property of the parties to the marriage’”. it is to be read widely and conformably with the purposes of the act. gummow and hayne jj said at 397 that “the term ‘property’ is not a term of art with one specific and precise meaning”. the purpose of the act as set out in section 79(1) is to alter interests in property to which a party has an interest in possession or reversion.
guidelines for adding back to the property available at trial (a) dissipation of property and expenditure other than on legal fees [27] the full court held in ajo & gro and ajo & gro[279] that addbacks fall into “three clear categories”: where the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and “waste” or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets.[280] [28] however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever “a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation”, the full court describing such a proposition as “unduly simplistic”.[281] an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is “the exception rather than the rule”.[282] [29] the fundamental precept that addbacks are exceptional, reflected in the decisions just referred to, also mirrors what has been said in earlier decisions of the full court that, for example, “the family court must take the property of a party to the marriage as it finds it”[283] at trial. an important parallel proposition is that the parties do not “go into a state of suspended economic animation” after separation.[284] thus, reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback. [30] two fundamental premises emerge from ajo & gro and the authorities preceding it. first, “adding back” is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.[285] (b) expenditure on legal fees [31] to the considerations just discussed must be added the propositions emerging from authority that paid legal fees as a category of addback is imbued with considerations specific to that expenditure. the full court said in chorn:  ] in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. [57] if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. [58] if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post‑separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post‑separation income or acquisitions.  ] those passages can be seen as an attempt to establish “guidelines”,[286] undertaken after a detailed examination of earlier authorities,[287] for the treatment of paid legal fees within s 79 proceedings. there can be little doubt that the statements made in that case have been applied by trial judges ever since. [33] the word “guidelines” is used advisedly so as to distinguish the same from “binding principles of law”.[288] the distinction is important. failure to follow a binding principle of law is an error of law. by contrast, the failure of a trial judge to follow a guideline:[289]
...does not of itself amount to error, for it may appear that the case is one in which it is inappropriate to invoke the guideline or that, notwithstanding the failure to apply it, the decision is the product of sound discretionary judgment. [however] [t]he failure to apply a legitimate guideline to a situation to which it is applicable may ... throw a question mark over the trial judge’s decision and ease the appellant’s burden of showing that it is wrong...  ] the guidelines emerging from chorn should be read together and read conformably with the full court authorities upon which they are based. that being so, the delineations there referred to — “the funds used existed at separation ... such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them”, or “funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours” or received by a party “in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)” - cannot be seen as determinative of the exercise of discretion but, rather, as informing it. [35] again, the matters just referred to have important ramifications in an appellate context. they may ease the appellant’s burden of showing that “although the nature of the error may not be discoverable ... a substantial wrong has in fact occurred”,[290] or that the decision is “plainly wrong, [the] decision being no proper exercise of [the] judicial discretion”.[291] equally, they may ease the burden of establishing that irrelevant considerations have been taken into account or that relevant considerations have not been taken into account. [36] paid legal fees occupy a particular position in the consideration of addbacks by reason of s 117(1) of the act, a matter not relevant to any other form of expenditure or dissipation of property the subject of an addback claim. [37] an order failing to addback legal costs is a pre-emptive decision about one party paying the other’s legal costs. the statutorily prescribed default position is that neither party pays all or some of the other party’s costs.[292] [38] if, contrary to the demands of that section, there is to be a payment of costs, the award is dependent upon a finding of justifying circumstances which, in turn, is dependent upon (non-exhaustive) considerations all of which are informed by antecedent events - for example, whether one party has been “wholly unsuccessful” and “the conduct of the parties to the proceedings”.[293] an award of the costs of trial, if any, is in the usual run of events made after the respective entitlements of the parties to a settlement of property have been assessed and, importantly, any awarded costs are paid from the assessed entitlement to property received by the paying party. [39] as has been said, legitimate guidelines “guide the exercise of a discretion”, they do not replace it.[294] guidelines, must “[preserve], so far as it is possible to do so, the capacity ... to do justice according to the needs of the individual case”.[295] the decision to addback or not addback paid legal fees remains a matter of discretion. but, a finding that it is just and equitable to not addback an amount of legal fees so paid is a finding that it is just and equitable for the other party to contribute to the costs of the first party in that proportion as part of an overall assessment of the justice and equity governing their property division. [40] the considerations just referred to are plainly always important and central to the exercise of that discretion in respect of paid legal fees. [41] the passages from chorn, quoted above, draw a distinction between legal costs met from property that would otherwise be available at trial and legal costs met from funds “generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)”. the proposition there advanced, that such expenditure “would generally not be added back”, also needs to be seen as a guideline informing the relevant discretion rather than determining it. a further distinction is suggested in chorn between funds generated in that manner and “[f]unds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement”. [42] the latter suggestion recognises the discretion inherent in the task and also, perhaps, that in the particular circumstances of a case, adding back sums generated post-separation in the different manners suggested might create injustice as much as it might cure it.[296] ... [46] in stanford v stanford,[297] the high court emphasised as fundamental that a consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order begins by “identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property”.[298] [47] the essence of a claim for addbacks is that the asserted sum/s should be added to the value of the existing property interests of the parties and, subsequent to the assessment of contributions, credited to the spending party as part of the value of their assessed entitlements. doing so does not offend what was emphasised by the high court. adding back does not seek to create property interests that do not exist. rather, doing so emphasises that satisfying the respective requirements of ss 79(2) and (4) of the act to do justice and equity can require an “accounting” or “balance sheet” exercise for the purposes of s 79(2) and (4), so as to include the value of the dissipated property or expended sums within the total value of the parties’ existing interests in property, and to credit the value of same against the assessed entitlement of the dissipating or spending party.[299]
the matrimonial asset pool ] first, it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests in the parties in the property. ... the question posed by section 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order ...   item 9, being “legal fees paid by the father from sale of [c] pty ltd shares” asserted by the mother to be $56,249 and left blank by the father, (2) item 10, “interim distribution of funds” to the mother asserted by the father to be $12,000 and asserted by the mother to be nil, (3) item 13, being a “personal loan from ms bf (home and shares)”, asserted by the mother to be a joint debt of $483,291 with no assertion in relation to that item being made by the father, and (4) item 14, being “personal loan from ms bf (schooling, day care and mortgage payments)” paid by the mother in the sum of $83,400, a liability disputed by the father, though it does not indicate if the father disputes that the debt is owed at all or if the father disputes that the debt should be included in calculating the matrimonial asset pool. i must take it as the former.   item 10, “interim distribution of funds” to the mother asserted by the father to be $12,000 and asserted by the mother to be nil, (3) item 13, being a “personal loan from ms bf (home and shares)”, asserted by the mother to be a joint debt of $483,291 with no assertion in relation to that item being made by the father, and (4) item 14, being “personal loan from ms bf (schooling, day care and mortgage payments)” paid by the mother in the sum of $83,400, a liability disputed by the father, though it does not indicate if the father disputes that the debt is owed at all or if the father disputes that the debt should be included in calculating the matrimonial asset pool. i must take it as the former.   item 13, being a “personal loan from ms bf (home and shares)”, asserted by the mother to be a joint debt of $483,291 with no assertion in relation to that item being made by the father, and (4) item 14, being “personal loan from ms bf (schooling, day care and mortgage payments)” paid by the mother in the sum of $83,400, a liability disputed by the father, though it does not indicate if the father disputes that the debt is owed at all or if the father disputes that the debt should be included in calculating the matrimonial asset pool. i must take it as the former.   item 14, being “personal loan from ms bf (schooling, day care and mortgage payments)” paid by the mother in the sum of $83,400, a liability disputed by the father, though it does not indicate if the father disputes that the debt is owed at all or if the father disputes that the debt should be included in calculating the matrimonial asset pool. i must take it as the former.
item 9 and item 10
any moneys remaining in the account at the conclusion of the six-month period be divided equally between the parties.
item 13  £20,000 in 2012 to assist the parties to come to australia, (2) £10,000 in about july 2014, probably for purchase of a motor vehicle, and (3) £250,000 in april 2013 toward purchase of the bc street, suburb bd property.   £10,000 in about july 2014, probably for purchase of a motor vehicle, and (3) £250,000 in april 2013 toward purchase of the bc street, suburb bd property.   £250,000 in april 2013 toward purchase of the bc street, suburb bd property.   paragraph 350 in the mother’s affidavit, (2) paragraph 84 of the maternal grandmother’s affidavit referring to annexure c, and (3) the concession made by the father in cross-examination,[300] the further loan was made in june 2014 in the sum of £10,000.   paragraph 84 of the maternal grandmother’s affidavit referring to annexure c, and (3) the concession made by the father in cross-examination,[300] the further loan was made in june 2014 in the sum of £10,000.   the concession made by the father in cross-examination,[300] the further loan was made in june 2014 in the sum of £10,000.
the further loan was made in june 2014 in the sum of £10,000.
item 14
...that, pending further order, the mother be responsible for mortgage payments and outgoings associated with the former matrimonial home and for the school fees (and arrears) associated with [school s], noting that the mother intends to obtain a loan for this purpose and will seek to have such loan taken into account in the final property proceedings.
the matrimonial asset pool as the court finds
is it just and equitable to make a property settlement order?
what order for adjustment of property interests is proper to be made?
it may be contended that the mother’s contributions were made significantly more arduous due to the family violence she endured.
relying on kennon, but counsel conceded that, “this, of course, depends on the findings regarding domestic violence.”
have had a significant adverse impact upon [the mother’s] contributions to the marriage, or, to be put the other, would have made her contribution significantly more arduous than they ought to have been.
consideration of any adjustment required under section 79(4)(e) – the factors in section 75(2) of the act
a property order proper to be made  the mother retain the town be, city ca uk, property, (2) the motor vehicle 2, (3) the vehicle, (4) the moneys received by her as interim property distributions, and (5) the whole of her superannuation entitlements.   the motor vehicle 2, (3) the vehicle, (4) the moneys received by her as interim property distributions, and (5) the whole of her superannuation entitlements.   the vehicle, (4) the moneys received by her as interim property distributions, and (5) the whole of her superannuation entitlements.   the moneys received by her as interim property distributions, and (5) the whole of her superannuation entitlements.   the whole of her superannuation entitlements.   the [c] pty ltd shares, (2) his motor vehicle 1, (3) the interim property distributions received by him, (4) the addback of his legal fees paid in the sum of $44,586, and (5) his superannuation entitlements.   his motor vehicle 1, (3) the interim property distributions received by him, (4) the addback of his legal fees paid in the sum of $44,586, and (5) his superannuation entitlements.   the interim property distributions received by him, (4) the addback of his legal fees paid in the sum of $44,586, and (5) his superannuation entitlements.   the addback of his legal fees paid in the sum of $44,586, and (5) his superannuation entitlements.   his superannuation entitlements.   the debt owed to the maternal grandmother in relation to the car purchase, (2) the debt owed to the maternal grandmother in relation to the home purchase, (3) her debt owed to the maternal grandmother in relation to their loan agreement ($83,400), (4) her uk student loan, and (5) any capital gains tax payable on the sale of the town be, city ca, united kingdom property, that sale being agreed between the parties to be a necessary and unavoidable result of the mother succeeding in having an order made that she be able to attempt to keep the bc street, suburb bd property.   the debt owed to the maternal grandmother in relation to the home purchase, (3) her debt owed to the maternal grandmother in relation to their loan agreement ($83,400), (4) her uk student loan, and (5) any capital gains tax payable on the sale of the town be, city ca, united kingdom property, that sale being agreed between the parties to be a necessary and unavoidable result of the mother succeeding in having an order made that she be able to attempt to keep the bc street, suburb bd property.   her debt owed to the maternal grandmother in relation to their loan agreement ($83,400), (4) her uk student loan, and (5) any capital gains tax payable on the sale of the town be, city ca, united kingdom property, that sale being agreed between the parties to be a necessary and unavoidable result of the mother succeeding in having an order made that she be able to attempt to keep the bc street, suburb bd property.   her uk student loan, and (5) any capital gains tax payable on the sale of the town be, city ca, united kingdom property, that sale being agreed between the parties to be a necessary and unavoidable result of the mother succeeding in having an order made that she be able to attempt to keep the bc street, suburb bd property.   any capital gains tax payable on the sale of the town be, city ca, united kingdom property, that sale being agreed between the parties to be a necessary and unavoidable result of the mother succeeding in having an order made that she be able to attempt to keep the bc street, suburb bd property.   within 42 days of the making of these orders, the parties do all acts and things and sign all documents so as to cause the joint nab account ending [...71] and the joint [bank bg] account to be closed and any monies remainign [sic] therein to be paid to the husband.
the icl’s costs application
very briefly, your honour, on the mother’s case, my client would be getting just about nothing and of course that’s irrespective of whether or not he’s successful on the children or not, as it appears she suggests no swing at all for 75(2), but more importantly than that, my client, if he’s successful in relation to the parenting, will see him caring for four children. he has an income of about 150, $160,000 a year. he will have next to no assets. he won’t ever get any meaningful child support from the wife because she has already said she’s not going to be working. so, in those circumstances, we would say it would be just and equitable there not be an order for the costs of the icl to be sheeted home to my client.[303]
the father’s application for costs
dr barnett: ... her view was, “i don’t have capacity to do that. i haven’t been given appropriate notice.” i certainly understand that.[308]
suggests to the court that the mother did not make adequate arrangements to liaise with her witness as this court expects all litigants to do. this was a discourtesy to the court.
