reasons for judgment
deputy chief judge mcclelland:
introduction
1 these are parenting and property proceedings between the applicant father, mr sweet (“the father”) and the respondent mother, ms sweet (“the mother”).
2 the parties have two children, x born in 2013 (eight years old) (“the older child”) and y born in 2015 (7 years old) (‘the younger child”) (collectively, “the children”). at the commencement of proceedings, the children were living with the mother and spending no time with the father.
3 in respect to parenting proceedings, the father seeks that the parties have equal shared parental responsibility, with a weekabout shared care arrangement to enable him to be an involved and active father. the mother originally sought for the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility, for the children to live with the mother and for the children to spend time with their father for two hours each alternate week in a supervised capacity. the mother also originally contends that she has been the subject of family violence perpetrated by the father but believed that it is important that the father is involved in the making of long term decisions for the children due to the children’s close and loving relationship with the father.
4 the mother also had significant concerns in relation to the father’s ongoing use of marijuana and his refusal to participate in court ordered urinalysis testing. as will be discussed in this judgment, the father gave implausible reasons for not participating in the required urinalysis testing and showed little insight into his conduct and its overall effect on the physical and emotional wellbeing of the children.
5 therefore, during the course of the proceedings, it became apparent that it is currently not in the best interests of the children to spend time with the father. the mother adopted the proposal of the independent children’s lawyer (“icl”) for the mother to have sole parental responsibility and for the children to spend no time with the father until he addresses his mental health and substance abuse challenges.
6 for reasons which i set out in this decision, i have found the mother’s allegations and concerns are of substance and that finding, together with other considerations, has influenced both the parenting and property orders that i have made. in summary, i have made orders for the children to live with the mother and spend no time with the father until he can address his mental health and substance abuse issues. i have also determined that the property of the parties should be adjusted such that the mother receives 70 per cent and the father receives 30 per cent of the overall property distribution. in so doing, i have included an adjustment as a result of the consequences upon the mother of her being subjected to family violence perpetrated by the father including verbal abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour. further, i have made an adjustment of 18 per cent to reflect the required future needs of the mother in caring for the children in a full time capacity.
background
7 the father was born in 1976 and is currently 45 years of age, while the mother was born in 1980 and is currently 41 years of age.
8 the parties commenced a relationship in 2009. the father contends that the parties separated in november 2019 and the mother contends that the parties separated on 30 october 2020. for reasons which i explain, in circumstances where the father’s evidence is in conflict with that of the mother, i prefer the mother’s evidence. i accept that the parties separated on or about 30 october 2020, at which time the mother ceased to sleep in the master bedroom and slept on a foldout bed in the children’s bedroom.
9 it is agreed that, following their separation, the parties continued to live under the one roof until 19 february 2021, at which time the mother applied for a family violence intervention order (“ivo”) in circumstances that will be outlined in greater detail below.
10 in 2011, the father sold his property located in suburb n, victoria which he had purchased prior to cohabitation. the sale proceeds were used to discharge the mortgage and the parties agree that the balance of $100,000 was applied to purchase the former matrimonial home. the father contends that an additional amount of approximately $23,000 was applied, from the net proceeds of sale, for the purchase of furniture for the former matrimonial home. the father has not, however, provided evidence of such purchases.
11 in 2011, the parties purchased the former matrimonial home situated at g street, suburb h, victoria for $365,000 including stamp duty.
12 in 2012, the parties married.
13 during 2013, the father sustained a carpal tunnel injury to his wrist at work.
14 during 2015, the father had surgery on his wrist. he has not returned to work after undergoing that surgery.
15 in 2016, the mother resumed full-time employment after the birth of the children and has continued to work on a full-time basis since then.
16 in late 2019, the father received a disablement payout from his superannuation fund totalling $254,000. documents have not been produced in respect to the payment, however, it did not appear to be disputed that the payment was made up of between approximately $100,000 and $105,000 in respect to total and permanent disablement of his right hand and the balance of $154,000 being superannuation benefits and interest which he had accumulated up until that point in time. there is a significant dispute as to how those funds have been applied by the father. however, it is not in dispute that, initially, the father paid an amount of at least $234,000 into an bank o investment account.
17 as at march 2020, the amount held in the bank o investment account remained at $234,000.
18 as at 15 july 2021, the amount in the father’s bank o investment account was $200,000, as recorded in the father’s financial statement filed at that time. the father contends that those funds have been expended and his financial statement dated 4 april 2022 does not include reference to any such funds.
19 the children did not spend time with the father in respect to the period from 19 february 2021 until june 2021.
20 the father initiated proceedings in the then federal circuit court of australia on 27 april 2021.
21 on 8 june 2021, interim orders were made for the children to spend time with the father on condition that the paternal grandmother was required to be in substantial attendance. the time and communication provided for in those orders was: each wednesday from the conclusion of school or 3.10 pm until 7 pm each saturday from 9 am until 2 pm communication by telephone on monday from 6 pm.

23 on 3 september 2021, correspondence was received by the mother from the o superannuation fund in respect to a request she made for the purposes of these proceedings. the correspondence indicated that the father had the following amounts in the fund: as at 22 february 2021 – $231,725.55 as at 17 august 2021 – $116,490.80 as at 3 september 2021 – $117,230.24
24 on 19 october 2021, interim orders were made, with certain orders by consent, which provided as follows,  order 5 of the orders of 19 july 2021, requiring the father’s overnight time to occur at the paternal grandparent’s home be discharged.

the court further orders by consent that:   for christmas the children will spend time:   from 2.00pm on christmas eve to 2.00pm on christmas day with the mother, and (b) from 2.00pm christmas day to 2.00pm boxing day with the father.   for x and y’s birthdays, the children will spend time with the parent whose care they are not ordinarily in from the conclusion of school (or 3.10pm if a non-school day) until 6.00pm.

(as per the original)
37 in final submissions, the mother agreed to and supported the orders sought by the icl. additionally, both the mother and the icl raised potential safety concerns as a result of the demeanour of the father in the witness box and the derogatory statements which he made regarding the mother. in light of those concerns, it was agreed by the mother and the icl that it would be appropriate for restraints to include injunctions replicating, in part, the terms of the interim ivo made on 8 february 2022.
legal principles - parenting proceedings
38 part vii of the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”) sets out the relevant statutory provisions applicable to proceedings in relation to children. section 60b of the act sets out the objects and principles of pt vii. these are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by: ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and protecting children from physical or psychological harm arising from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.
39 in masson v parsons [2019] hca 21, (2019) 266 clr 554 at [8], in their joint judgment, their honours kiefel cj, bell, gageler, keane, nettle, and gordon jj noted that the focus of the objects was on “ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child”.
40 for reasons which i set out in this decision, regrettably, unless and until the father takes steps to address his mental health and substance abuse challenges, i have found that the children would be placed at an unacceptable risk of harm in spending time and communicating with the father, such that having a meaningful relationship with their father would not be in their best interests.
the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
41 section 61da of the act relevantly provides that, when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
42 the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or family violence.
43 further, the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. as a result of the pattern of abusive and coercive and controlling conduct engaged in by the father towards the mother, i have determined that it is not in the best interests of the children for the presumption to apply.
best interests of the child
44 section 60ca of the act provides that, in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to the children, the court must regard the best interests of the children as the paramount consideration. this is also confirmed in s 65daa of the act.
45 section 60cc of the act sets out the list of matters that the court must consider in determining what is in the children’s best interests. the primary considerations set out in s 60cc(2) of the act are, as follows: the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
46 in balancing these considerations, s 60cc(2a) of the act requires the court to give greater weight to the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
47 in jurchenko & foster [2014] famcafc 127, (2014) flc 93-598 at 79,420, the court noted at [123] that:
... having a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.
48 in cotton & cotton [1983] famca 18, (1983) flc 91-330, nygh j noted that it was desirable for a child to maintain a meaningful relationship with both parents, however, his honour stated at 78,252:
however, that desirability only operates when there is a chance of a meaningful relationship which is beneficial to the child. it is not, in other words, a question of contact for contact sake. if there is a situation where contact with a parent is on balance likely to cause more harm to the child than good, or even is not likely to confer any benefit, then little purpose is served by this court making orders for such contact. that does not detract from the desirability of the child having a meaningful relationship, but the possibility of a meaningful relationship must first exist. (emphasis added)
49 in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 (“mccall & clark”) at 83,476, [122], the full court said:
...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit for the child having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests. (emphasis added)
50 in mccall and clark at [117], the full court also cited, with approval, the comments made by bennett j in g & c [2006] famca 994, where it was said that the enquiry “requires a court to evaluate the extent to which a meaningful or significant relationship with both parents is going to be of advantage to a child” (emphasis added).
51 in loddington & derringford (no 2) [2008] famca 925 (“loddington”) cronin j held at [169] that:
there is no legislative definition of “meaningful relationship” but for there to be a meaningful relationship, it must be healthy, worthwhile and advantageous to the child. (emphasis added)
52 in loddington cronin j further added at [173] that an assessment of the benefit to the child must be made according to “the peculiar facts of what the parents are offering.”
issue of risk
53 the second primary consideration in determining the child’s best interests, as set out in s 60cc(2)(b) of the act, is the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected or exposed to abuse or violence. the question that may be asked is whether there is an unacceptable risk of physical and/or psychological harm in the child spending time with either parent.
54 in stott & holgar [2017] famcafc 152 at [38], the full court confirmed that, where unacceptable risk is alleged, the court must give consideration to the facts of the case and decide whether or not those facts could reasonably be said to raise an unacceptable risk of harm. if a determination is made that such a risk exists, the court is then required to consider whether that unacceptable risk could be ameliorated by safeguards.
55 the task of determining whether an unacceptable risk, in terms of s 60cc(2)(b) of the act, exists is assisted by having regard to the following principles: in devising tests to determine whether unacceptable risk exists, the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child’s paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access: see m v m (1988) 166 clr 69 (“m v m”) at 78, b and b [1993] famca 143, (1993) flc 92-357 at 79,778. it is now well established that “unacceptable risk” does not arise solely in respect of allegations of physical or sexual abuse. the “test” of “unacceptable risk” also requires assessments of risk of future physical and emotional harm: see a v a [1998] famca 25, (1998) flc 92-800 at 84,996, m v m at 77. such an unacceptable risk can include any or all matters that compromise the safety, welfare and well-being of a child, and is examined in light of an accumulation of factors proved: see director-general, department of family and community services (nsw) v the colt children [2013] nswchc 5 at [146]–[148]. the components which lead to a conclusion that an unacceptable risk exists need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of “unacceptable risk” from the accumulation of factors, none or some only of which are proved to that standard: see johnson & page [2007] famca 1235, (2007) flc 93-344 at 81,890-81,891 endorsing and applying the principles set out in a paper prepared by the hon john fogarty, ‘unacceptable risk – a return to basics’ (2006) 20 australian journal of family law 249. having identified the existence of an unacceptable risk, it is then necessary for the court to assess whether that risk “is able to be sufficiently managed or ameliorated”: see blinko & blinko [2015] famcafc 146 at [83] referring to russell & close [1993] famca 62.
56 for reasons which i set out below, i have determined that there is an unacceptable risk in the children spending time with or communicating with the father unless and until he takes steps to address his mental health and substance abuse issues.
additional considerations
57 section 60cc(3) of the act sets out a number of additional considerations to which the court is required to have regard. to assist analysis, those considerations can conveniently be grouped under the following headings:
issues relating to the children – their views, level of maturity, culture and relationships:
issues relating to the parents – decision making, time spent with children, fulfilled obligations, attitude, capacity and exercise of responsibility:
issues of family violence:
effect of change:
practical difficulty of implementation:
avoiding further proceedings:
other relevant matters:
consideration – parenting dispute
credit
58 during the hearing of this matter, the father failed to give responsive answers to questions on a number of occasions and, instead, took the opportunity to editorialise on the answers he gave to make critical and derogatory comments about the mother. the father generally failed to accept any wrongdoing on his part in respect to his interactions with the mother or in the discharge of his parenting responsibilities. at times, the father became emotionally dysregulated, shifting from mock laughter to crying, to angry gestures and shouting. his evidence was coloured by his stated perception that he has been the victim of unfair conduct perpetrated by the mother and the family law system, including the court and lawyers who practice in it. on one occasion, when asked to repeat what he said, he advised the court that he was talking to himself. he was a most unsatisfactory witness.
59 my assessment of the father’s credibility has also been influenced by the implausible evidence he provided regarding his assertion that he has ceased using marijuana, which i set out in greater detail below.
60 further, for reasons which i subsequently set out, much of the evidence given by the father regarding circumstances where he attended the former matrimonial home on 5 february 2022 is also implausible. that incident is significant because it led to the mother applying for an ivo and resulted in the children not spending time with the father in the period subsequent to that date.
61 the mother, on the other hand, gave answers which were directly responsive to questions asked of her and lacked the same animus that was reflected in the father’s responses. in my opinion, she did the best she could to answer questions directly to the best of her ability without hesitation or unreasonable elaboration.
62 significantly, the mother acknowledged that, in the past, she has engaged in inappropriate conduct in terms of, on occasions, being moody and also in respect to statements that she made to the father. unlike the father, she indicated that she was prepared to render an apology to the father for inappropriate things that she has said to him in the past.
63 the mother’s answers were consistent with her affidavit evidence and other supporting documentation and they were also internally consistent with evidence she gave during the course of these proceedings.
64 accordingly, wherever there is a dispute in the evidence provided by the parties, i have preferred the evidence provided by the mother.
approach
65 to ensure that all relevant s 60cc considerations are addressed, in this matter i deal with those matters set out in s 60cc(3) before addressing the primary consideration set out in s 60cc(2).
issues relating to the children – their views, level of maturity, culture and relationships
66 i accept the mother’s unchallenged evidence presented in her affidavit filed 18 march 2022 that the older child is in grade three at q school, progressing at the required level and otherwise doing well at school. the younger child is in grade one at q school and i also accept that she is progressing at the required level and otherwise doing well at school.
67 in the family report of ms d dated 7 march 2022, it was observed at paragraph 124 that the younger child “seemed to be meeting her developmental milestones.”
68 ms d cautioned at paragraph 125 that, given the children’s ages, great weight should not be placed upon their views. i accept that is the case.
69 the younger child reported to ms d that she “enjoys her time with her mum” and that she has a “good” relationship with her sister, although they fight sometimes. the younger child further reported that she likes living with her mother and the maternal grandmother who moved into the former matrimonial home in february 2021.
70 at paragraph 131 of ms d’s report, the younger child explained that she “also enjoys her time with her dad”, however also said “i can’t remember what i do with dad”. it is further noted at paragraph 132 of the family report that she likes spending time with the father, ms r (the father’s partner") and her three children. however, again, the younger child said that she could not remember what she plays with them.
71 ms d reported, at paragraph 136, that the older child also appeared to be meeting her developmental milestones. the older child noted that she liked living with her mother, maternal grandmother and the family’s two cats (paragraphs 135 and 140). she further stated that she gets along well with her younger sister despite having arguments sometimes (at paragraph 142).
72 the older child also stated that she enjoys spending time with her father, his current partner and her three children, but when asked about the time she would like to spend with the father, stated at paragraph 150 that it would be “ok to see dad again”, and when asked how that would occur she stated that she wanted the time spent arrangement to “stay how it is” (paragraph 148).
73 the child inclusive conference memorandum of ms s dated 14 october 2021 recorded that the children advised her that they enjoy their father’s company and wanted to continue spending time with the father.
74 ms d reported at paragraphs 151–152 that the children “appear to have a normal and loving sibling relationship” and “both girls also appear to enjoy spending time with their stepsiblings.”
issues relating to the parents – decision making, time spent with children, fulfilled obligations, attitude, capacity and exercise of responsibility
75 there is a dispute between the parties as to who was the primary carer for the children when they were young. in circumstances where i prefer the evidence of the mother, i accept that the mother took approximately six months maternity leave after the birth of the older child before returning to work in 2014 in a full-time capacity (paragraph 9 of mother’s affidavit).
76 i also accept the evidence of the mother that, following the birth of the younger child, she remained on maternity leave for a period of approximately 12 months before returning to work on a full-time basis (paragraph 10 of mother’s affidavit).
77 at paragraph 28 of the father’s affidavit, he attests to managing the home duties for the former matrimonial home, including the care of the children, since their respective births. however, the fact that it was the mother who took maternity leave and not the father who took paternity leave is consistent with the mother’s evidence that she was the children’s primary carer from their birth. the father also attests that in the period subsequent to the mother returning to full-time work in 2016 he cared for the children “exclusively.”
78 the father’s account that he cared for the children “exclusively” after the mother returned to full-time work in 2016 is clearly an overstatement. in circumstances where the mother has provided extensive particulars of the care she provided and i have found her to be a credible witness, i prefer the evidence of the mother as to the extent to which the parties respectively cared for the children.
79 i accept the evidence that, other than times that she was at work, the mother was the primary carer of the children, including tending to the children’s morning and night routines, giving them breakfast, getting them dressed and ready for the day, taking them to daycare, kindergarten or school and picking them up from daycare, kindergarten and school. the mother acknowledged, however, that on occasions, the father would take the children to daycare kindergarten or school and also, on occasions, collect them at the end of the day.
80 i accept that, after returning from work and having collected the children, the mother would follow a routine of giving the children afternoon tea, bathing them, reading bedtime stories to them and tucking them into bed for the night. i also accept the mother’s evidence that she would settle the children if they woke during the night and comfort them as required (paragraph 10 of mother’s affidavit).
81 i also accept the mother’s evidence that she was the parent who was primarily responsible for assisting the children with their homework and reading to the children in the evening.
82 at paragraph 91 of his affidavit, the father attested to similarly undertaking a number of tasks in respect to the care of the children. i have had regard to that evidence and accept that the father did assist in respect to the care of the children, including taking them to some extracurricular activities. however, for reasons which i have earlier stated, i generally prefer the evidence of the mother where it is in conflict with that of the father. i find that the mother was the parent who primarily undertook child caring responsibilities in addition to being the primary breadwinner of the family from 2016 onwards.
83 the mother’s evidence that the father was not very involved in the educational activities of the children is consistent with the manner in which he presented during the course of these proceedings, which was erratic and lacked focus.
84 i also accept the mother’s unchallenged evidence at paragraph 11 of her affidavit that she endeavoured to spend quality time with the children, including enjoying activities such as:
10.1 taking the children to playcentres and playdates with friends, 10.2 visiting my mother and other extended family members, 10.3 trips to the beach and playgrounds, 10.4 i took [the older child] to weekly “toddler time” at the suburb t library, 10.5 taking the children to dance classes, 10.6 baking with [the younger child], and 10.7 friday movie nights with the children. (as per the original)
85 the mother acknowledged, during cross examination, that the father would, on occasions, take the children to their dance classes.[1] the mother also acknowledged that, during those times that the father cared for the children while the mother was at work, he would on occasions take them to play with children of parents he was friendly with.
86 there was no dispute that, following surgery to an injured hand in 2015, the father ceased working and remained at home. while i am satisfied that the mother was primarily responsible for caring for the children both prior to and after her return from her days employment, the father nonetheless adequately cared for the children during those hours that the mother was at work.
87 the mother was not challenged on her evidence that, in the period subsequent to march 2020, she substantially worked from home during the period of the social distancing measures implemented by the government to combat the spread of the covid-19 virus. this continued to be the case until the parties physically separated when the father left the former matrimonial home on or about 20 february 2021.
88 i accept that, during that period, the mother had the opportunity of observing the extent to which the father engaged in responsibilities in caring for the children. while i accept and agree with the submissions of counsel for the icl that the mother’s evidence regarding the extent to which the father engaged in those activities was less than sympathetic, i am nonetheless satisfied that the mother continued to perform the substantial portion of child caring responsibilities during that period, including before commencing her work from home, working from home and in the period subsequent to working hours.
89 in the four month period subsequent to the parties’ separation in february 2021, the children spent relatively limited time with the father.
90 i accept that, in the period between june 2021 and february 2022, the children enjoyed spending time with the father, his partner and his partner’s children. in circumstances where the father’s evidence as set out in paragraph 40 of his affidavit was not challenged, i accept that the children engaged in such activities as drawing, reading, playing tag and going to the park to play on the park equipment.
91 having regard to the opinion of family report writer ms d, to which i subsequently refer, i am satisfied that the children were well presented and are doing well at school. i am also satisfied that both parents perceive them to be happy children. having regard to those observations and the mother’s evidence, i am satisfied that the mother is competently fulfilling her responsibilities as a parent. she is exclusively providing for the children’s physical needs, attending to their emotional needs, developing their intellectual capacities and ensuring that the children engage in extra-curricular activities.
92 as previously noted, the parties separated in tense circumstances when the mother obtained an ivo against the father. as noted above, the children did not spend time with the father between approximately february 2021 and 8 june 2021. i accept that the mother resisted the children spending time with the father during this period because of her concerns regarding the father’s mental health and ongoing substance abuse. having had the opportunity of observing the father giving evidence in these proceedings, i am satisfied that the mother’s concerns were entirely understandable. in those circumstances, i give less weight to ms d’s opinion that the mother’s conduct has been rendered unreasonable by a tendency to catastrophise. in my opinion, her reasons for restricting the children from spending time with the father during that period were entirely understandable and appropriate.
93 i am satisfied that the mother acted responsibly in the period subsequent to june 2021, at which time orders were made by consent providing for the children to spend time with the father on condition that it was supervised by the paternal grandmother and subject to the father attending for supervised drug screening. similarly, i am satisfied that the mother acted responsibly in providing the father with the opportunity of spending additional time with the children as provided for in the orders made on 19 october 2021 to which i have earlier referred. it is noted that a precondition to the children spending ongoing time with the father and for that time to progressively increase was the father engaging in mental health therapy and undertaking supervised drug screening tests.
94 the father has acted in a grossly irresponsible manner in failing to satisfy those conditions and the outcome of these proceedings is substantially the result of that failure.
95 in that respect, at paragraph 28 of her affidavit, the mother records letters being sent from the icl to the father on five occasions in the period subsequent to 19 october 2021 requesting confirmation that he would attend for drug screening in accordance with the october 2021 orders. the father failed to provide a reply until he was challenged in respect to that failure during the course of these proceedings. as i have set out above in respect to the issue of credit, the father’s response for failing to undertake that drug screening was entirely implausible. the lack of credibility of the father’s evidence in that respect, together with his demeanour during the course of these proceedings, was further exacerbated when the court learned that the father had obtained a prescription for medicinal marijuana in the weeks immediately before the proceedings. this has led me to infer that there is a likelihood that the father is continuing to regularly use marijuana.
96 in that respect, the father acknowledged that, up until the point when he left the former matrimonial home on 8 february 2021, he used marijuana on a daily basis. the father gave evidence explaining that he was immediately able to abstain from use after leaving the former matrimonial home. this, he contends, is corroborated by the fact that he undertook three drug screens which showed a negative result. however, those drug screens were not supervised and, therefore, i give little weight to the results of those drug screens as corroborating the father’s evidence that he ceased using marijuana as attested by him.
97 the fact that the father failed to undertake supervised drug screens in accordance with the orders made in october 2021 is telling. there was much at stake. the precondition to the father spending an increasing amount of time with the children was his preparedness to undertake those drug tests. his explanation provided in cross-examination for the fact that he did not read his emails, including because his phone was playing up, is implausible in circumstances where it is clear that he used his phone on a number of other occasions. further, it is clear that the father did receive some email communications. in that respect, for instance, the father acknowledged in his interview with ms d that he received an email from the mother’s solicitor regarding an ivo (paragraph 55 of ms d’s family report). in circumstances where the mother has applied for two ivo’s and did not have solicitors acting for her in february 2021, it is necessarily the case that the email was sent in february 2022.
98 perhaps sensing the implausibility of the problematic phone excuse, the father then shifted his position to excuse his non-attendance at the supervised drug screens because he considered the orders made by consent in october 2021 lacked balance due to the fact that they did not similarly require the mother to undertake drug screening. the inconsistency in the father’s evidence in that respect causes me to reject the father’s evidence as to why he failed to attend a supervised drug screening. a more plausible explanation is that he was well aware the drug screening results would show a positive finding at least for the use of marijuana. in that respect, at paragraph 23 of her report, dr e records the father acknowledging that he had “avoided being drug tested until he was sure it [marijuana] had [not] left any traces in his body.” in other words, i reject the father’s evidence that he failed to attend for drug screening tests after october 2021 as a result of lack of notice. the more plausible explanation is that his failure to attend drug screening was a positive decision which he made in circumstances where he was aware the tests would show a positive result.
99 in addition to that evidence, the manner in which the father states he was provided a prescription for medicinal marijuana by a local doctor on 2 march 2022 is similarly implausible. the father’s evidence is that he consulted a general practitioner, who he had not previously seen for treatment, for the purpose of obtaining advice about receiving mental health therapy in accordance with a mental health treatment plan. further, the father’s evidence was that, instead of developing and prescribing such a mental health treatment plan, the local doctor prescribed medicinal marijuana. i consider this as implausible. indeed, as noted by counsel for the icl, it is telling that, when that proposition was put to ms d during cross-examination for her comment concerning the doctor’s course of treatment, she laughed, indicating that the father’s account of that occurring was implausible. i respectfully agree with the submission of counsel for the icl that, when considered in the context of the father’s implausible evidence as to why he failed to attend supervised drug screening in the period subsequent to the october 2021 orders, the fact that the father arranged to obtain a prescription for medicinal marijuana is more likely to have been with the intention of masking any positive result from drug screening that he may be required to undertake as an outcome of these proceedings.
100 the father has, as i have noted, been grossly irresponsible in failing to address what i have found to be ongoing substance abuse and to address his ongoing mental health challenges that were evident in his interviews with dr e and the family report writer ms d, as well as during the course of these proceedings. in that respect, i refer to the dysregulated, obnoxious and insulting manner in which the father behaved while the mother was giving evidence in these proceedings.
the father’s parenting capacity
101 the fact that a parent has mental health challenges does not justify a conclusion that a parent lacks parenting capacity and by no means disqualifies them from fulfilling their responsibilities as a parent. however, the nature of the father’s presentation in this case is such that, unless and until his mental health challenges are addressed, the children will not, in my opinion, benefit from having a meaningful relationship with him and, indeed, they will be exposed to an unacceptable risk of at least emotional and psychological harm in spending time with him.
assessment of dr e
102 that assessment which i have made in respect to the father’s parenting capacity and the risk that he presents to the children has been made in the context of the evidence of dr e who, in her report dated 12 october 2021, noted the following:
he presented as being abrupt and rigid in his thinking. themes of hostility towards [the maternal grandmother] and paranoid ideation were prevalent throughout his narrative. he tended to externalise all responsibility for any difficulties, reflecting a lack of self-insight and positive distortion (paragraph 2). [the father’s] account of his relationship with [the mother] was disordered and at times inconsistent, he described significant stressors related to hostility with [the mother’s] family, a belief that [the mother] exhibited poor parenting skills, and the belief that she was having an affair (paragraph 10). [the father] expressed significant hostility towards [the maternal grandmother] and her relationship with [the mother] throughout the interview (paragraph 11).
103 mr sweet’s presentation during the interview was consistent with evidencing “narcissistic tendencies”, with dr e noting at paragraph 26:
individuals with this profile may show arrogance and/or lack of self-insight. this profile suggests overly positive responses that are most likely due to a trait-like tendency towards overly self-favourable presentation rather than situational demands.
104 dr e noted the possibility that testing results obtained in respect to the father may have been distorted by the father’s attempt at positive impression management which “may underrepresent the extent and degree of any significant findings.” based on those findings, dr e nonetheless opined at paragraph 41 that the father presented with:
... a number of personality difficulties with narcissistic and paranoid features, in particular a poor sense of identity, inflated self-esteem, suspiciousness, and distrust...cognitive rigidity, impacting on his capacity to perceive alternative ways of responding in interpersonal relationships, internalising responsibility, or adapting his parenting or co-parenting strategies.
105 dr e also cautioned at paragraph 43 that the father presents with moderate parental risk:
with concerns regarding capacity to moderate his thoughts and emotions adaptively, ongoing substance use, and the inability to communicate with [the mother] appropriately.
106 as a result of her observations, dr e recommended at paragraphs 44 and 45: e father] requires psychological assistance to manage his personality and emotional vulnerabilities that contribute to difficulty managing conflict in interpersonal relationships. a significant aspect of treatment would include developing insight and internalising responsibility. it would be recommended that this therapy occurs regularly (e.g., fortnightly to three weekly) over a period of 12 months. the therapist should be provided with a copy of this report and/or other collateral information. ongoing and regular monitoring of [the father’s] drug and alcohol use is recommended. [the father] should be abstinent from any marijuana use and be restrained from drinking alcohol in the 24 hours before and during time with the children. should he be unable to limit his drug or alcohol use or be noted to relapse into a regular pattern of use, more intensive drug and alcohol programs (such as detoxification or rehabilitation) are recommended.
107 i respectfully agree with the submissions by counsel for the mother and counsel for the icl that the father’s presentation in these proceedings was consistent with the personality traits identified by dr e. indeed, in circumstances where one could ordinarily expect that a party to parenting proceedings would want to put their best foot forward, the father’s presentation showed that, if anything, the observations which gave rise to dr e’s assessment were conservative and understated.
108 her recommendations were, nonetheless, insightful and were appropriately reflected in the october 2021 interim orders to which i have referred. it is regrettable that, despite being provided with dr e’s report in october 2021, the father has not engaged in mental health therapy, nor has he taken steps to address his substance abuse issue. in that respect, at paragraph 57 of her family report, ms d records the father as stating that he did not need counselling, which he described as being “a waste of time and money” and that he is “fine”.
109 as result of the manner in which the father has conducted himself during the course of these proceedings, i respectfully accept and adopt the submissions of both counsel for the mother and counsel for the icl that a precondition to the father spending time with the children must be obtaining appropriate psychological assistance and engaging in therapy to address his substance abuse.
assessment of ms d
110 in making that decision, i have also had regard to the observations of the family consultant, which were entirely consistent with the observations of dr e. in that respect, in her family report dated 7 march 2022, ms d noted the following at paragraphs 49, 81 and 163:  e father] presented as agitated, outraged, hopeless and distressed. he cried uncontrollably at times. [the father] displayed very limited insight. ... by the end of the interview, [the father] was crying uncontrollably. given the difficulty he was experiencing in controlling his tears, [the father] decided it would not be in the children’s best interests to spend time with them during observations scheduled for later in the day as “i’d get too upset”. it was agreed that the observation would not go ahead. ... [the father’s] presentation during interview would support the assertion that he has difficulty with emotional regulation.
111 further, ms d stated at paragraph 163:
he also appeared to have a lack of insight and a tendency to blame. it also seemed that [the father] has chosen to extricate himself rather than maintain himself in a constructive way with the family law “conflict”, at the expense of maintaining an ongoing relationship with the children.”
112 ms d agreed with the opinion of dr e that the father would benefit from psychological counselling but observed that her impression was that “[the father] may not meaningfully engage in such counselling.”
the mother’s parenting capacity
assessment of dr e
113 in respect to the mother, dr e noted the following in her report dated 12 october 2021: the mother presented “with insight into her history of mental health difficulties in general but lacked awareness into how it impacted on her relationships” (paragraph 2). the mother had experienced a traumatic childhood, with her father experiencing mental illness leading to suicide which he had attempted on a number of prior occasions. the mother witnessed the father dying from suicide at age 12. prior to committing suicide, the mother’s father had been abusive towards his wife, the mother and her brother (paragraph 3). as a child, the mother also had to deal with the impact of her father’s suicide on her mother, the maternal grandmother. the maternal grandmother had a nervous breakdown and was institutionalised for a period of time when the mother was 15 or 16 years old (paragraph 4). dr e recorded that the mother had attempted suicide herself aged approximately 19 years and was hospitalised for a period of time. she has not had any subsequent suicidal ideation since that event (paragraph 18).
114 the mother reported to dr e that she was assessed as suffering posttraumatic stress disorder at age 17 or 18. dr e noted that subpoenaed information indicated that the mother “met the diagnostic criteria for ptsd and major depressive disorder at the time she received trauma therapy in 2017/2018” (paragraph 16).
115 the mother reported to dr e that she had “experienced depression on and off for several years, which she believed was situational due to relationship issues.” dr e recorded that the mother had days where she experienced difficulty in getting out of bed (paragraph 17).
116 at paragraphs 31 and 32 of her report, dr e opined:
ms sweet has been diagnosed with ptsd and major depressive disorder in the past. psychological evaluation indicated that ms sweet had significant difficulty modulating her moods consistent with a recurrent depressive disorder. she presented as prone to acts of passive-aggression and/or flares of momentary aggression because suppressed emotions could no longer be contained. her presentation during interview suggested that she was not experiencing symptoms of an acute mental illness at the time. parental risk evaluation identified ms sweet’s parental risk to be low, with primary risk related to her capacity to support a relationship between the children and their father and minimise the children’s exposure to interpersonal conflict directly or indirectly.
117 dr e identified risks associated with the mother’s parenting capacity being related to her capacity to support a relationship between the children and their father. however, for reasons which i have explained throughout this judgment, the mother’s concerns about the welfare and emotional safety of the children in the father’s care are, in my view, entirely understandable and reasonable.
118 at paragraph 46 of her report, ms d notes that the mother has a history of post-traumatic stress disorder following her father’s suicide when the mother was 12 years old. she also notes that the mother reported suffering depression.
119 ms d noted at paragraph 113 that, after receiving the report of dr e, the mother has engaged in three sessions of counselling with a psychologist. the mother has found the sessions to be helpful and “really productive.”
120 ms d noted at paragraph 167 that the mother presented “as anxious and defensive.” however, she acknowledged that if the mother has been subjected to the coercive, controlling and abusive conduct of the father which she has described, then her presentation is entirely understandable. this is so particularly in the context of the trauma she had experienced of her father’s suicide. for reasons which i subsequently set out, i am satisfied that the mother has been subject to conduct of that nature by the father.
121 ms d also further commented, at paragraph 167, that the mother’s experience in terms of being subjected to the father’s conduct and her childhood background may have contributed to what she described as the mother’s “understandable tendency to catastrophise.” the mother, to her credit, acknowledged during cross examination that she is “perhaps...prone to exaggeration.”[2] however, despite that tendency, the mother’s conduct, including attempting to resolve this matter by facilitating the children spending time with the father subject to him receiving appropriate mental health therapy and support for his substance abuse, has been entirely reasonable and responsible. the fact that the father’s relationship with the children has not developed as contemplated by the october 2021 orders is entirely the making of the father and not due to the mother’s lack of genuineness or good faith.
issues of family violence
history of coercive and controlling conduct
122 the mother attested to being the subject of coercive and controlling conduct on the part of the father during the course of the parties’ relationship. in that respect, at paragraph 46 of her affidavit she stated:
there were several occasions when he threatened to harm me, in front of the children. once such occasion was following the birth of [the older child], when [the father] threatened to burn down the house with me in it. i had to hide in the master bedroom with [the older child] and call the police. the police attended at the property and suggested that [the father] leave for the evening, which he did.
123 in her interview with ms d, the mother stated that the father was:
often yelling at me, cruel and demeaning things like – it is no wonder your dad killed himself, he would be yelling and demeaning at me in front of the children and slamming doors. in 2014 he threatened to burn the house down. i had to lock myself and [the older child] in the bedroom because he wouldn’t stop yelling at me
124 when cross-examined about the 2014 incident by counsel for the mother, the father stated that, following a dispute with the mother, she asked him to leave the house and the father replied “i’d rather see the house burn than you live in it.”[3]
125 in circumstances where i found the mother to be a truthful witness and much of the father’s evidence lacked credibility, i prefer the mother’s account of events.
126 the mother was not challenged on her evidence that on more than one occasion she has felt the need to call police because she was concerned for her own safety and that of the children. again, having observed and heard the father during the course of the proceedings, i can understand the mother’s concerns for her safety and the prospect of the children witnessing the father’s erratic behaviour.
127 the mother reported to dr e that during her relationship with him, the father was quick to lose his temper and was “emotionally volatile and would often yell and make derogatory remarks to her during disagreements” (paragraph 9). the mother’s statement to dr e in that respect was entirely consistent with the father’s presentation during the course of these proceedings.
128 at paragraph 42 of her affidavit, the mother attested that the father’s marijuana use, which he acknowledged occurred on a daily basis up to the time of separation, caused the father to “become erratic and paranoid”. the mother attested that the father, when under the influence of the drug, “would sing at very loud volume about me being a “cow” and he would sing derogatory songs about [the mother] in front of the children.”
129 the mother stated to ms d that she learned “a long time ago just to stay silent. if i tried to say anything it would just get worse” (paragraph 92). in a similar context, the mother stated to dr e that “she rarely argued back, tending to remain quiet on the belief that any attempts to discuss their issues would be futile” (paragraph 9).
130 the mother further advised ms d at paragraph 90 of her report that:
the more [the father] smoked drugs, the more erratic he became, his mental health deteriorated, he became angry and moody, we were always walking on eggshells not knowing what mood he was going to be in when i got home from work. towards the end of the relationship he was very paranoid i was cheating. he’d wake me up in the middle of the night and question me about where i was.
131 i accept that evidence as an accurate account of the mother’s experience.
incidents giving rise to family violence interim intervention orders (ivo)
february 2021 incident
132 at paragraph 32 of her affidavit the mother attested that, on or about 18 february 2021, the father verbally abused her and “stormed towards [the mother] and slammed the door in [her] face.” the mother expanded upon that evidence at paragraphs 129 through to 134 of her affidavit as follows:
...on 18 february 2021, i returned home from work and from collecting the children from school. when i entered the home i immediately noticed that [the father] had removed our sound system from the lounge room, a large painting from the family room, my wedding and engagement rings and three ornaments that had been gifted to me by my family which held great sentimental value. [the father] also had taken down all family photos and canvases around the house. i found this incredibly strange as [the father] and i had never discussed him taking anything from the home and i had not given [the father] permission to do so. when the children and i entered the home, [the father] went into the garage to smoke marijuana, as he often would when the children and i returned home. having noticed items missing, i walked around the house to ascertain whether anything else had been taken. 1 took photographs of items that remained as i feared he would continue to take items without permission or discussions. i went to the shed where [the father] was growing his marijuana and took several photographs of the contents of the shed. i asked [the father] where the items were that were missing and what else he had taken. [the father] did not give me an answer, [the father] then began yelling at me to get out of the garage and to go away. i discussed [the father’s] marijuana use, as he was smoking marijuana whilst talking to me. i deny that i recorded this conversation. [the father] then headed towards me and i became frightened that he would assault me. he slammed the door close to my face. this startled y, who was sitting opposite the garage door. she looked at me to ensure i was not hurt. i took the children to their bedroom and called the police. i was in shock at what had occurred and did not know what else to do. i was scared for my and my children’s safety. the police arrived approximately thirty minutes later, at which point [the father] had not long left the home. i did not know where he had gone nor when he would return, however, i assumed that he had just taken the dog for a walk. the police entered the home and questioned me about the incident. the police advised me to collect some belongings and leave to stay with my mother in suburb n, which i did. [the father] returned home and i told him to stay away from me and the children and that the police suggested that we leave for the night. i deny that i told [the father] that he could remain in the house for one more night. the following day i applied for an intervention order against [the father].
133 the mother stated that her level of concern was increased because she had observed the father smoking marijuana immediately before he engaged in that conduct. having observed the erratic behaviour of the father during the course of these proceedings, i can well understand that the mother would have been concerned about her safety and that of the children.
134 the father’s account of the incident is set out at paragraphs 31 and 32 of his affidavit. the father contends that it arose from the mother challenging him as to what he had done with her wedding rings, in circumstances where he had been removing items of property to take to his parent’s home. the father’s account is as follows: when i got to the front door, [the mother] was yelling at me saying “where are my rings, where are my rings.” i continued to walk through the home and gave [the older child] a kiss and talked to her about how school went, like i would do every-day. i asked her what the best part of her day was and what the worst part of her day was. i went into the play-area where [the younger child] was sitting and gave her a kiss and asked her how her day was. [the mother] was following me around the house still yelling at me, and asking me where her rings were. i asked her to stop following me and then went out to the garage to get some more items. after telling [the mother] 3 times to leave me alone i closed the door behind me. [the mother] opened the door and stood in the doorway of the garage. i asked [the mother] to leave me alone. [the mother] then started talking about my cannabis use. she stated that she has proof of my cannabis use. i told [the mother] that she also uses cannabis. believed [the mother] may have been recording the conversation. [the mother] then said to me “you do not have any proof” then shut the door. [the mother] then left and as she was walking away she yelled out to me words to the effect of “i have what i need to get an intervention order, the police will be here to kick you out” i then walked into the home to see [the younger child] who had observed the confrontation. i gave her a hug and talked to her about something other than the argument in order to distract her. i then went to have a shower and take our dog for a walk. i returned to the front yard to give our dog some water. [the mother] then said to me “stay away from me do not come near me . you have the house for one more night”. [the mother] then told [the children] to go to the car. i put them in the car as to comfort them. i did not want to agitate the situation in front of [the children]. i gave [the children] a kiss while they were in the car. i put their seatbelts on. whilst the car door was still open [the mother] drove off. i waved goodbye [the children].
32. two days later i was served with an application for an intervention order and interim intervention order and i was forced to vacate the matrimonial home. (as per the original)
135 the evidence of the father presents himself as acting rationally and reasonably when compared to the mother, who was acting irrationally and unreasonably. that was contrary to the manner in which the parties presented in these proceedings. while recognising the prospect of both parties being agitated and behaving in a mutually unpleasant manner towards each other on that occasion, the father’s account of himself behaving in a rational and reasonable manner is entirely inconsistent with his presentation in these proceedings. having observed that presentation, i prefer the evidence of the mother that the father was acting unreasonably, aggressively and in an intimidating way. in that context, the father acknowledged closing a door in front of the mother but states that he “closed the door behind me.” in circumstances where i accept the mother’s evidence that the father was behaving in an aggressive manner, i further accept her evidence that he, in fact, slammed the door in the manner in which she described.
136 the mother obtained an interim ivo from the magistrates’ court of victoria on 19 february 2021. it was served upon the father later that day. the father was still living in the matrimonial home at that time but subsequently left the home after being served with the order.
137 the mother attested at paragraph 36 of her affidavit that, in order to attempt to resolve parenting issues, on 27 october 2021 she withdrew her application for a final ivo. it is to be noted that the mother’s withdrawal of that application occurred in the same month as she reached consent interim orders in the federal circuit and family court of australia. the mother’s withdrawal of the notice is consistent with her endeavours to improve the relationship between herself and the father and does not represent a withdrawal from her allegations regarding the conduct that the father engaged in towards her in february 2021.
138 in circumstances where i accept the mother to be a witness of truth, i accept that the father engaged in the conduct described by the mother as she attested in those paragraphs of her affidavit which i have referred.
february 2022 incident
139 following a further incident in february 2022, the mother sought a new ivo against the father and his new partner. it was granted by the magistrates’ court of victoria on 8 february 2022. the protected persons were named as the mother and the children and the order suspended the orders of 19 october 2021. the circumstances in which that occurred was, according to the respective parties, the following.
140 at paragraphs 59 and 60 of the mother’s affidavit, she attests as follows:
on 28 january 2022 the children and i received positive pcr covid test results. as such we were only permitted under the dhhs guidelines to exit isolation on saturday 5 february 2022. i communicated this to [the father] via text messages. notwithstanding this, [the father] was demanding the children to be made available to him on 4 february 2022. [the father’s] messages also indicated an intention not to return the children to my care until after the weekend. a letter dated 4 february 2022 was forwarded to [the father] and the independent children’s lawyer in relation to this issue making clear: the children would not be made available to spend time with [the father] on that weekend, and in the event [the father] attended my home that afternoon i would be contacting the police. despite the letter from my lawyer, on saturday 5 february 2022, [the father] and his partner, [the father’s partner], attended my home. they both commenced yelling abuse at me. [the father’s partner] approached my front door continuing to yell abuse. the children were able to hear the verbal abuse. i telephoned the police. they both left prior to the police arriving indicating to me they would be returning. i received a text message from [the father’s partner] reading “haha now you've done it will be back see you soon and get the girls.” i then received a further text message which read “dffh has been informed i have your mother swear at me what a lovely old lady lmao”...i remained at home for the balance of the weekend fearful of the return of the [the father] and [the father’s partner]. (as per the original)
141 the father’s account of the incident is set out at paragraphs 48 through to 66 of his affidavit as follows:
i note that there was an incident which occurred in early february 2022 and following this [the mother] sought a further ivo against me. the ivo was granted on 8 february 2022 listing [the mother] and the children as protected persons. the ivo suspended the court orders of 19 october 2021. [the mother] has accused me and my partner of attending her home in early february 2022 and yelling at her and her mother. whilst i admit to attending the home, i deny that my partner or i were yelling at [the mother] and [the maternal grandmother]. leading up to the incident, i recall that [the mother] advised me that the children may not be able to spend time with me on the upcoming scheduled weekend as [the mother] stated that her and the children had tested positive for covid 19. i recall that [the mother] then sent me a text message that the children would be out of isolation by the saturday. i mistakenly claimed that the children would receive their covid 19 test results on the thursday and if clear, i could collect the children on the friday pursuant to the orders. i subsequently contacted [the mother] to let her know that i would collect the children on the friday. [the mother] then responded that the children would not be getting their results until the friday and so, if he arrived to collect the children on the friday, she would call the police. i was of the understanding that i could collect them on the saturday following the isolation period, instead of friday. i proceeded to go to [the mother’s home with my partner and one of her children, on the saturday morning. i did not see the message from [the mother] not to get the children until i already arrived at the home. i recall that when i arrived the blinds were shut and i honked the horn a couple of times and messaged [the mother] asking where the girls were. while i was parked in my car in the street, i could hear yelling words to the effect of “get the fuck out of here, fuck off.” the neighbour then came out said “i think they went out.” i then went to door and rang the doorbell and said “hey kids, i’m just here to see you”. when i received no response, i said to the door “hey girls, dad was here to pick you up, love you, see you next time.” i then went back to the car. when i went to the car my partner [the father’s partner] told me that she saw the curtains in the house move. [the father’s partner] then went to the front door and called out that she could see the curtains moving and asked “what are you doing?”. i then heard the maternal grandmother yell “get the fuck out of here” at [the father’s partner]. i then heard [the mother] call out through the door saying that the children were listening and that she would call the police if we did not leave. i advise that i stayed in the car throughout the exchange and i recall that the only one yelling was [the maternal grandmother] (citations omitted)
142 the father’s account of what occurred on 5 february 2022 is inconsistent. in his affidavit, he notes that when he arrived at the property “the blinds were shut.” in responding to questions from counsel for the icl the father stated, however, that he heard shouting prior to arriving at the property and the shouting was also heard by his son sitting in the back seat of the car.[4]
143 the father’s evidence in that respect is inconsistent with the presentation that the occupants of the property did not want to be observed in the home. in that respect, the father attested that his partner reported to him that she “saw the curtains in the house move.” it is implausible that people resident in a house with curtains closed to remain unobserved would, at the same time, commence shouting at an approaching vehicle before it arrived at the property.
144 the father’s response to questions from the icl regarding the incident were generally unsatisfactory. in particular, when the father was asked why he did not immediately leave the property when he read the text message from the mother saying that the children would not be available for collection on the day, he said “yes i did, basically, yes.”[5]
145 it is not clear at what point in time the father observed the text message, but his evidence of leaving the property upon reading it sits uncomfortably with the evidence set out at paragraph 61 of his affidavit that he “went to the door and rang the doorbell”, before attempting to speak to the children through the closed door.
146 having regard to those inconsistencies in the father’s evidence and the manner in which he presented in these proceedings, i prefer the evidence of the mother as to what occurred when the father arrived at her home on 5 february 2022, including that the father failed to leave upon observing the text message that she had sent to him advising that the children would not be available for collection. i accept the mother’ s evidence that the father remained at the property for approximately 20 minutes and that the children were highly distressed during the period of the exchange between the paternal grandmother and the father’s partner, albeit through the closed front door of the property.
147 as noted above on 7 february 2022, the mother applied for an ivo and an interim order was granted on 8 february 2022 naming herself and the children as protected persons. that order is annexure -6 to the mother’s affidavit and, among the relevant conditions, suspended the orders made by the court on 19 october 2021. in addition to not engaging in any acts of family violence against the mother, the orders restrained the father from taking any action to:
2. intentionally damage any property of the protected person(s) or threaten to do so. 3. attempt to locate, follow the protected person(s) or keep him/her/them under surveillance. 4. publish on the internet, by email or other electronic communication any material about the protected person(s). 5. contact or communicate with a protected person by any means. 6. approach or remain within 5 metres of a protected person. 7. go to or remain within 200 metres of g street, suburb h or any other place where a protected person lives, works or ‘ atténds school/childcare. 8. get another person to do anything the respondent must not do under this order.
148 i accept the mother’s evidence that the order was served upon the father and his partner at 9.10 am on 11 february 2022. despite being served with that order, within minutes, at 9.13 am, the mother received a missed call from the father as well as a text message from the father which read “so i will pick up [the younger child] for school on monday.”
149 also, despite the order restraining the father from contacting the mother, on 14 february 2022, she received further missed calls from the father together with a text message which is set out at paragraph 64 of her affidavit as follows:
so what lies have you told [the children] why they can’t have their daddy [the father’s partner] an her children and rest of there lives? how will you react if the judge awards me full custody and you access and i raise girls in g street, suburb h and you pay me child support ad get off pain killers before seeing them after 5 months? because that’s what would be fairest outcome in our situation and you know it. you also know i would never stop you being in there lives. i am trying too forgive you [the mother] not sure if [the children] will.” (as per the original)
electronic surveillance of the mother
150 the mother attested that the father has engaged in stalking conduct directed towards her. at paragraph 44 of her affidavit the mother attested: e father] also installed cameras around the house and placed a tracking device in my car. [the father] would wake me in the middle of the night and question me about my whereabouts on a particular date and get angry if i couldn’t answer him. [the father] would also regularly check my mobile phone, reading the text messages and call history. i also became aware that he had installed a tracking application on my phone which allowed him to see where i was just by checking the application. this mobile phone served as my work phone as well as my personal phone. [the father] also knew the passwords for my email account and checked my emails regularly.
151 the father denied the mother’s evidence in that respect. however, i accept the mother’s evidence in circumstances where i found her to be a truthful witness and in circumstances where her evidence is consistent with the statement the father provided to dr e at paragraph 13 of her report that he challenged the mother about having an affair and “her whereabouts” by “using information from her phone.”
152 in that respect, during cross-examination the father acknowledged asking the mother, on various occasions, where she had been and that he explained to her that her phone tracks where she has been. he asserts that he showed the mother how the tracking device on her phone works and, in doing so, found “hundreds” of places where she had been which she had not accounted for.[6] he further acknowledged pointing out to her one location where she had been and questioning her as to whether she had been at that location.
153 even taking the father’s evidence at its highest, it amounted to a fundamental breach of the mother’s right to privacy and amounted to unjustified, intrusive, controlling and coercive conduct.
154 the mother was not challenged on her evidence that, after separation, she found a listening device under her bed and a tracking device in the console of her car. i accept the mother’s evidence generally in that respect to be truthful.
155 ms d opined at paragraph 164 of her report that if the court finds, as i have, that the father engaged in monitoring the mother’s movements, such a finding “is concerning and aligns with dr e’s assessment that [the father] may have paranoid tendencies”. i am satisfied that he does have those tendencies and that, together with the aggressive demeanour which he demonstrated during the course of these proceedings, is concerning.
coercive conduct during the course of litigation
156 the position of the father in these proceedings has been unreasonable. he contends that unless he obtains orders in accordance with his application for the children to spend equal time with him, he will elect to spend no time with the children. he has also withdrawn from an agreed position to resolve the parties’ property proceedings. the position he has taken has meant that non litigious resolution of these proceedings has been an impossibility.
157 the mother has, accordingly, been locked into costly litigation, both in terms of financial cost and, significantly, emotional cost.
158 in circumstances where it could reasonably be inferred that the father would be aware of the impact of his behaviour during the course of these proceedings on the outcome of the proceedings, the father has nonetheless conducted himself in a disruptive and intimidatory manner while the mother was giving her evidence in these proceedings. the father’s conduct was such that i directed the court officer to mute the father on the microsoft teams video link. the father, nonetheless, remained visible on the computer screen. i recorded on the transcript (6 april 2022, p.144 lines 44–47) observations of the father’s conduct, which included:
the father laughing visibly, holding his hand over his mouth to hide his mirth. i have recorded him looking up to the ceiling and shaking his head. i have recorded him looking to the ceiling and muttering words which aren’t audible because of him being on mute.
159 at one stage, in an action that can only be described as bizarre, he placed both his hands on his head and vigorously ruffled his hair, while presenting a mocking look on his face. the mother’s distress at the father’s conduct was clearly visible, yet he continued to engage in the conduct.
160 the effect on the mother was profound. she broke down crying and was visibly trembling. as a result, i directed that the video feed from the father be disconnected such that the father could still hear the proceedings but could no longer be heard or seen for the duration of the mother’s evidence. as i noted on the transcript, i directed that course of action to be taken because i formed the view that the mother was being re-traumatized by the father’s conduct. [7]
ongoing concerns for the mother’s safety
161 ms d observed at paragraph 171 of her report that the mother “has a genuine fear of [the father]” and cautioned “that fear cannot and should not be dismissed.” ms d recommended that “unless and until [the father] can demonstrate to [the mother] that he can and will abide by the ‘rules’, that fear will only be enhanced.” based on the court’s observations of the manner in which the father presented, together with numerous offensive comments he made in respect to the mother and the maternal grandmother, the court shares the concerns voiced by counsel for the mother and the icl that the father presents as a potential safety risk to the mother.
162 as i foreshadowed during the course of the proceedings, and in respect to which i invited submissions, i therefore propose making orders which replicate, in part, the orders set out in the interim ivo made on 8 february 2022.
163 additionally, i do not propose to make order 18 as proposed by the icl and the mother on the basis that it would provide that these orders are intended to override any ivo made by a state court. i will instead include a notation that these orders are not intended to override any such ivo that is in place or which may be made by a state court. this will ensure that a relevant state court has the flexibility to address any immediate concerns raised by the mother regarding her own safety.
effect of change
164 the children have not spent time with the father since the interim ivo was made on 8 february 2022. the orders made in these proceedings will not change that situation unless and until the father satisfies the conditions proposed by the icl and supported by the mother, which are reflected in the terms of the orders that i make in these proceedings. those orders essentially require the father to engage in appropriate mental health therapy, to take steps to address his substance abuse issues and for his endeavours to do so, in those respects, to be monitored.
165 while it has been inconsistent, the children have, up until february of this year, spent regular time with the father and, from time to time, continued to have telephone contact with the father. the orders that i make will suspend contact from occurring on an indefinite basis unless and until the father complies with the orders. in those circumstances, i am satisfied that it is appropriate that the solicitor for the icl is appointed to explain these orders to the children as proposed by both the mother and the icl.
practical difficulty of implementation
166 if the father does satisfy the preconditions to spending time with the children, as set out in these orders, then there will be some practical difficulties associated with the children’s time with the father being professionally supervised. most relevantly, that supervision will involve cost. in circumstances where the necessity for that supervision is as a result of the conduct engaged in by the father, i respectfully agree with the submission of the icl and the mother that it is appropriate for the father to meet the cost of that supervision.
avoiding further proceedings
167 during the course of these proceedings the father indicated, on a number of occasions, that unless he obtained an outcome whereby the children spend equal time with him, he would not further engage with the children or the mother. if, having been presented with an opportunity to address his mental health and substance abuse issues, the father declines to take up that opportunity and, instead, effectively walks away from his relationship with the children, then that will be his decision.
168 that outcome was accepted by the mother and the icl as being regrettable however, in the context of the unacceptable risk posed by the father to the children, it is an outcome that is preferable to the children retaining contact with the father in the absence of him taking steps to address his mental health and substance abuse issues.
other relevant matters
169 there are no other relevant matters to address.
170 in this matter i have found that the perpetration of family violence upon the mother by the father is such that it is untenable to make an order for equal shared parental responsibility.
171 while i have considered the possibility of including an order for parental responsibility which provides an obligation on the part of the mother to consult with the father prior to making a decision regarding significant matters impacting upon the children, i have dismissed that possibility as also being untenable. this is because, having observed the father during the course of these proceedings, i accept the mother’s evidence as to the difficulty she has faced in communicating in a rational and child focussed manner with the father.
the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of the children’s parents
172 for reasons which i have set out, i have determined that, unless and until the father takes steps to address the challenges he faces in respect to managing his mental health and substance abuse, it is not in the best interests of the children to have a meaningful relationship with the father.
173 unless those matters are addressed, the children would inevitably be exposed to conduct of the nature of that which was observed during the course of these proceedings, which i have earlier described. they would also be likely to be exposed to inappropriate comments made by the father who, the evidence satisfies me, fails to acknowledge appropriate boundaries in his communications with the children. this includes the father’s own evidence that, on 5 february 2022, he attempted to communicate with the children during a heated, confrontational situation which occurred at the former matrimonial home.
174 i am also satisfied that it is likely the father would make disparaging comments about the mother to the children in circumstances where he repeatedly stated his intention to, at some stage, tell the children the truth about the mother, that truth being the father’s misguided negative view of the mother who he described as evil and someone who he regretted ever marrying.
175 from an early age, the children have been aware of the parental conflict. the child inclusive conference memorandum provided by ms s dated 14 october 2021 recorded that both girls stated that their parents did not like each other.
176 in her interview with ms d in march of this year, the older child gave an account of what she observed in the incident which occurred on 5 february 2022, which led to the mother obtaining an ivo, in the following terms at paragraph 147:
... dad and [the father’s partner] yelled at mum. i heard it. because we were sick and we didn’t go with them. we wanted to stay and go - both a little bit”. [the older child] added: “it made me feel a little bit sad. ... [the father’s partner] walked up to the door, i can’t really remember where dad was but he was yelling too”.
177 in addition to the father’s mental health challenges and interrelated issues concerning substance abuse to which i have earlier referred, ms d opined at paragraph 165 that the father “may have anti-social tendencies that make it difficult for him to ‘abide by the rules’ when he does not agree to those rules”. ms d further commented that “it is lamentable that [the father] cannot see that his aberrant behaviours only serve to disadvantage him, and more importantly, the children.”
178 those observations of ms d were, with respect, insightful and prophetic. the manner in which the father conducted himself in these proceedings was completely unacceptable. in circumstances where one would expect that a reasonable person would present themselves in the best light, the father’s presentation was such that he presented in a belligerent, disrespectful, emotionally dysregulated and, at times, animated and aggressive manner. the manner of his presentation was matched by his offensive portrayal of the mother.
179 that conduct on the part of the father raises a concern, not only from the point of view of the mother’s safety and the children being exposed to conduct of that nature when they spend time with him, but also because the father repeated on several occasions that the children have a right to know what he regards as the “truth” about their mother and that he intends to tell them what he regards as that truth. this is also consistent with the information the father provided to ms d in paragraph 173 of the family report that, in the event of the court not making orders as sought by him, he would wait to spend time with the children until they are older, at which time he would “tell them the truth”.
180 the failure on the part of the father to recognise appropriate boundaries in terms of the parental conflict impacting upon the lives of the children was reflected in the father’s evidence that the children of his partner had offered to attend court to give evidence on his behalf. the necessary inference of that offer is that, despite being advised by the court at the conclusion of the first day’s hearing not to discuss his evidence in these proceedings, at the very least, the father, in broad terms, related the nature of the proceedings to the children of his current partner.
181 in those circumstances, the court can have no confidence that, even in the context of professional supervision, the father would act appropriately. specifically, i am satisfied that unless and until the father obtains appropriate therapy to address his mental health challenges and the interrelated substance abuse challenges that he clearly experiences, it is inappropriate for the children to spend any time with the father. i am satisfied that for them to do so would present an unacceptable risk of emotional and psychological harm to them.
conclusion and orders in respect to parenting proceedings
182 having determined that, unless and until the father obtains appropriate therapy to address his mental health challenges and substance abuse issues, it would not be in the best interests of the children to have a meaningful relationship with the father and, further, that there would be an unacceptable risk to the children in spending time with the father, even in a situation of professional supervision, i have determined that orders should be made in terms of those proposed by the icl.
183 those orders were supported by the mother and will, in essence, provide that a precondition to the children recommencing a relationship with the father is dependent upon the father obtaining appropriate mental health therapy and counselling to address his substance abuse.
184 subject to appropriate evidence being provided that the father has engaged in a meaningful way with that counselling and therapy, the orders provide for the children to spend supervised time with the father.
185 additionally, as i foreshadowed during the course of the proceedings, i will also make orders which, in part, replicates those orders contained in the interim ivo made by the magistrates’ court of victoria on 8 february 2022.
legal principles – property aspect of dispute
186 in respect to the parties’ dispute regarding the division of their property in these proceedings, s 79 of the act sets out the following:  in property settlement proceedings, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate: (a) in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them--altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property, or   in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them--altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property, or
... including: (c) an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property, and (d) an order requiring:   an order for a settlement of property in substitution for any interest in the property, and (d) an order requiring:   an order requiring:  either or both of the parties to the marriage, or ...
to make, for the benefit of either or both of the parties to the marriage or a child of the marriage, such settlement or transfer of property as the court determines.
...  the court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.
187 in exercising that discretion, the court is required to take into account the matters set out in s 79(4) of the act, as follows:  in considering what order (if any) should be made under this

188 the high court in stanford v stanford [2012] hca 52, (2012) 247 clr 108 (“stanford”) at 120, [35] confirmed that, before an order is made adjusting the parties’ property, the court is required to make a determination that it is just and equitable to do so. that determination is to be made, however, not as a discrete or preliminary issue but requires the court to consider the matters set out in s 79(4) of the act.
189 in the leading case of hickey and hickey and attorney-general (cth) [2003] famca 395, (2003) flc 93-143, the full court held at 78,386 [39] that, in considering the matters set out in s 79(4) of the act, the preferred approach was to adhere to the following four steps:  identify and determine the value of the asset pool of the parties as at the date of the hearing (this necessarily involves identifying both the assets and liabilities), (b) identify and assess each of the parties’ financial and other contributions up until the date of the hearing (this can include the financial contributions made before, during and after the marriage), (c) assess how future and other events may have a financial impact on either of the parties, such as their age and state of health and their income and property or financial resources (known as the s 75(2) factors), and (d) step back and examine this formula-based reasoning against the history of the marriage, intangible considerations and other contingencies so as to consider whether the outcome represents a just and equitable result.   identify and assess each of the parties’ financial and other contributions up until the date of the hearing (this can include the financial contributions made before, during and after the marriage), (c) assess how future and other events may have a financial impact on either of the parties, such as their age and state of health and their income and property or financial resources (known as the s 75(2) factors), and (d) step back and examine this formula-based reasoning against the history of the marriage, intangible considerations and other contingencies so as to consider whether the outcome represents a just and equitable result.   assess how future and other events may have a financial impact on either of the parties, such as their age and state of health and their income and property or financial resources (known as the s 75(2) factors), and (d) step back and examine this formula-based reasoning against the history of the marriage, intangible considerations and other contingencies so as to consider whether the outcome represents a just and equitable result.   step back and examine this formula-based reasoning against the history of the marriage, intangible considerations and other contingencies so as to consider whether the outcome represents a just and equitable result.
190 that approach had been endorsed many times: see, for example, manolis v manolis (no 2) [2011] famcafc 105 at [63] (per coleman, may and ainslie-wallace jj), kildea v kildea [2007] famca 1524, (2007) 38 fam lr 347 at 365, [104] (per finn, may and boland jj), c and c [2005] famca 429, (2005) flc 93-220 (“c and c”) at 79,639 [22] (per bryant cj, finn and coleman jj) and 79,655 [142] (per o’ryan j). however, as the high court noted at 120, [35] in stanford, s 79(2) of the act provides that the court shall not make an order altering the interests of the parties in the matrimonial property “unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order”. accordingly, since stanford, it has generally been the practice of the court to determine, as an initial issue, whether it is just and equitable to make an adjustment of marital property.
191 the full court in perrin & perrin (no 2) [2018] famcafc 122 cited at [57]–[58], with approval, the decision in babett & falconer [2015] famcafc 124, (2015) flc 98-067 at 96,731 [44]:
within the family law context, those comments [in respect to the adequacy of reasons] should be seen as reinforced by the fact that the nature of the s 79 inquiry is, in essence, a broad discretionary assessment, which is neither an accounting nor mathematical exercise and which, effectively as a corollary, requires a "broad-brush approach".
is it just and equitable to make a property adjustment?
192 both parties sought an adjustment of their property interests pursuant to s 79 of the act. in that regard, in stanford at 122, [42], the high court said:
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).
193 these proceedings fall within the category of cases described in that decision, and as such, the requirement of a finding that it is just and equitable to adjust matrimonial property is readily satisfied. for the avoidance of doubt, i make that finding for the following reasons:  the parties currently own a property, and maintain a liability, in their joint names, (b) during the course of their relationship, the parties jointly contributed to maintaining their household, and (c) with the breakdown of their relationship, the parties seek to sever their financial relationship.   during the course of their relationship, the parties jointly contributed to maintaining their household, and (c) with the breakdown of their relationship, the parties seek to sever their financial relationship.   with the breakdown of their relationship, the parties seek to sever their financial relationship.

194 aside from the question as to whether there should be any amount notionally added back to the property pool as a result of the manner in which the father has applied a disability benefit and superannuation benefits, the parties agreed to the following balance sheet listing their property and superannuation available for adjustment as follows:

195 the mother contends that the amount of $123,711 should be notionally added back into the property pool as result of the father’s failure to disclose how those funds, which he has received by way of disability benefit and lump sum superannuation, have been applied. in that respect, the mother’s evidence is set out at paragraphs 95 and 96 of her trial affidavit as follows:
as at approximately march 2020, [the father’s] bank o investment account continued to hold a balance of approximately $234,000. by the time [the father] filed a financial statement in these proceedings, this indicated the bank o account held only $200,000. i am not sure as to how [the father] applied the $34,000, although i expect it would have been on legal fees for these parenting and property proceedings, and other associated costs. it appears that since filing his financial statement [the father] has accessed further substantial funds from bank o. a form 6 obtained from bank o indicates an account balance of $231,725.55 as at 22 february 2021 and a much lower account balance of $116,490.80 as at 17 august 2021. [the father’s] bank u account statements show deposits from bank o of $34,849.67 on 31 march 2021 and $99,999 on 20 july 2021.
196 i respectfully agree with the mother’s contention that the father has failed to disclose how he has applied those funds which were originally deposited in his bank o investment account, in circumstances where i am satisfied those funds have not been applied for the benefit of the mother or the children.
197 during the course of the proceedings, the father attested that he paid $50 per week to his parents when living in their home from february 2021 until approximately one month before the proceedings. it is also reasonable that the father would have daily living expenses. in circumstances where the father has not provided relevant bank statements, nor has he detailed his expenditure in his financial statement filed on 4 april 2022, it is not possible to identify those funds which have been applied by the father to meet his day-to-day living expenses. in that respect, the father attested that he has lent a portion of those funds to his current partner. in subsequent evidence, however, he stated those funds have been repaid.
198 in ajo and gro [2005] famcafc 104, (2005) flc 93-218 at 79,617 [30], the full court identified three categories where it may be appropriate to notionally add back an item of expenditure, as follows:  where the parties have expended money on legal fees: see djm & jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) flc 92-816 (“djm & jlm”) at 85,262, (2) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets: see townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 at 81,654, and (3) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw & kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644, including: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets: see townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 at 81,654, and (3) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw & kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644, including: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw & kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644, including: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.
199 i propose to add the amount of $50,000 back into the balance sheet. this is in circumstances where, during cross-examination, the father stated that he had applied the funds he has received from his disability and superannuation payments to his legal fees in the amount of $50,000 in these proceedings. the reason for doing so is explained in djm & jlm where, at 1,021, [11.6] the full court said:
for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to the proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by the parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought to be to add back costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reason why it is not taken ought normally to be spelt out. we see no reason advanced in this case as to why the costs paid should have been kept out of the pool. .
200 in this matter, unlike the father, the mother’s legal fees remain outstanding and will need to be satisfied from funds she receives by way of property adjustment in these proceedings. accordingly, there is no requirement to notionally add back to the balance sheet any legal fees incurred by the mother.
determination of balance sheet
201 accordingly, after notionally adding back the amount of $50,000 in respect to legal fees incurred by the father, the balance sheet setting out funds available for distribution between the parties is as follows:
legal fees paid by the father
$50,000
$ 740,000
super fund o wrap (at call, balance of $234,000 at separation)
$ 466,229
$ 661,865
contributions
initial contributions
202 the parties agree that they commenced their relationship in 2009 and were married in 2012. there is a dispute between the parties as to the date that they formally separated, however it is agreed that they remained living together until 19 february 2021. accordingly, i have assessed their relationship as being for a period of approximately 11 years.
203 the mother has not attested to having assets of significance at the commencement of their relationship. at paragraph 83 of her affidavit, she attests to owning a motor vehicle and superannuation of approximately $20,000. in the absence of evidence of the value of the motor-vehicle, i have not taken that item into consideration.
204 it is agreed that the father owned a property in the town of suburb n, victoria which was subject to mortgage. there is no evidence before the court as to the value of that property at the commencement of the parties’ relationship.
205 at paragraph 115 of his affidavit, the father attested that in 2010 he applied $150,000 from the net proceeds of the sale of the property owned by him at the commencement of the parties’ relationship towards the purchase of the former matrimonial home.
206 the father acknowledged at paragraph 117 of his affidavit that he purchased a motor vehicle for $32,000 from the $150,000 net proceeds of sale. during cross-examination, it was acknowledged that at the time the parties purchased the former matrimonial home, the father contributed $100,000 from the net sale proceeds of his suburb n property towards the purchase of the former matrimonial home. i accept that as a significant contribution on the part of the father. the father further attests to providing an additional $23,000 to acquire furniture for the new property. that is disputed by the mother. in the absence of that property being particularised and in the absence of evidence of the price paid for any such furnishings, i do not accept the father’s evidence that he made the additional contribution of $23,000.
207 the father also attests that he had two cars and a utility vehicle worth approximately $15,000, together with furniture of approximately $20,000 and savings of approximately $15,000. no evidence, however, has been provided to confirm the value of the furniture or the vehicles and i have not had regard to that evidence. the father was not challenged on his assertion that he had savings of approximately $15,000 at the commencement of the parties’ relationship.
contributions during the course of the parties’ relationship
208 at the time of commencement of the parties’ relationship, the father was employed as a tradesman. in 2012, he commenced employment at employer w as a labourer. however, one month into the role, he suffered pain in his right arm which was diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome.
209 in 2013, the father had surgery on his right hand and he returned to light duties at employer w for approximately two years. the father had further surgery in 2015. the father attests that he received a payment of $10,000 in respect to the injury in 2017 and an insurance payment of $105,000. the father did not identify the date that amount was received. in circumstances where particulars of the payment have not been provided by the father and where he has failed to provide proper disclosure, i accept the evidence of the mother set out at paragraphs 92 and 93 of her affidavit that the father applied approximately $20,000 of the amount he received for his own purposes and the balance was deposited in a bank o investment account retained by the father, rather than being applied for the purposes of meeting the family’s commitments. the manner in which the father has dealt with those funds and his lack of disclosure is a matter that i have taken into consideration pursuant to s 75(2)(o) of the act.
210 in 2010, the parties purchased the former matrimonial home for $357,000 of which, i have noted, the father contributed $100,000. the parties borrowed the balance of the required funds.
211 at paragraph 121 of his affidavit, the father attests that he paid for the following improvements to the former matrimonial home: $10,000 for a deck and pool $4,000 for air-conditioning $1,000 for a dishwasher $1,500 for outdoor art and plants $3,000 for a playground $500 for a fridge $1,500 for a pool fence $500 for a cat enclosure $1,000 to fix gutters to an outdoor area.
212 the father was not challenged on his evidence in respect to those acquisitions. the father further attested to paying approximately $1,200 per annum by way of pool maintenance. the father was not tested on that evidence, which i also accept.
213 the father further attested at paragraph 122 of his affidavit that he was loaned various amounts from family members. no evidence has been provided concerning whether those monies have been repaid or, if they have not been repaid, the nature of the loan agreements. without that information, it is not possible to determine whether those loans, to the extent that they have not been paid, are statute barred. accordingly, i have not had regard to those loans in assessing the father’s contributions.
214 the father further attests to assisting to pay down the mother’s hecs higher education debt during the course of the parties’ relationship. no particulars were provided as to the extent to which such a contribution was made by the father. accordingly, i have not had regard to that evidence in determining it to be a contribution on the part of the father.
215 as previously noted, the father attests that during the course of his relationship he was the primary carer of both children. i have not accepted that evidence. for reasons which i have set out above, i am satisfied that the mother remained the primary carer of the children from their birth until the parties’ physical separation in february 2021. i am further satisfied that in the period post separation, other than the limited time that the children have spent with the father between june 2021 and february 2022, the mother has been the children’s exclusive carer.
216 in addition to being the primary carer of the children the mother has, since 2016, been the primary breadwinner for the family. i accept her evidence that she was in full-time paid employment at the time the parties commenced their relationship and has remained in full-time employment, other than for periods of maternity leave as referred to at paragraph 88 of her affidavit. the mother attests to receiving a salary of approximately $65,000 per year after her return from maternity leave in 2016 and that her salary, inclusive of superannuation, is currently approximately $76,537 per annum.
217 i accept the mother’s evidence, as set out at paragraph 90 of her affidavit, that, in addition to being the primary breadwinner of the family in the period subsequent to returning to work in 2016, she was the party who was also primarily responsible for undertaking homemaking duties and caring for the children. the mother’s evidence in that respect is set out at paragraph 90 of her affidavit as follows:
i was also primarily responsible for each of the children after their respective births, with little physical or financial assistance from [the father]. on most days, i would get the children up and ready for day care (in the early years), then up and ready for kindergarten and, subsequently, school. i made their lunches and snacks, and transported them to day care, kinder and school (and now to the school bus stop), on most days. this continues at present. i was primarily responsible for picking them up from day care, kinder or school at the end of each day, and attending to their afternoon and evening routines once at home, including after school activities, snacks, preparing dinner, and their bath and bedtime routines. [the father] would occasionally help with these tasks, but the bulk of the load was carried by me. on top of this, i would look after most of the domestic chores including the washing, ironing, dishes, housework and other similar chores. it was a very busy and stressful time for me and i often felt very unsupported by [the father].
218 it was not disputed that, in late 2019, the father received a superannuation payout in the sum of $254,000. the father has not produced records providing a breakdown of that figure, but it did not appear to be disputed that the figure was made up of a $100,000 payment in respect to a disability entitlement associated with the injury to his right hand, together with a further $154,000 in superannuation which he had accrued up to that point of time, including interest.
219 the mother was not challenged on her evidence that the father did not apply any of those funds which he received for the benefit of the children or the mother but, instead, continued receiving centrelink benefits and financial support from the mother (paragraph 93 of the mother’s affidavit).
post separation contributions
220 at paragraphs 130–133 of his affidavit, the father attests that in the period after the parties’ separation, the mother withdrew $20,000 from one of his accounts and also $7,000–$8,000 from each of the children’s accounts. the father has not however, provided financial disclosure to substantiate that allegation and i have not had regard to that evidence.
221 similarly, at paragraphs 136–142 of his affidavit, the father alleges that the mother sold various items belonging to him, including a motor vehicle. the father has not provided any evidence to substantiate the value of those items, even if they have been sold by the mother.
222 in any event, in respect to the items referred to at paragraphs 130–142 of the father’s affidavit, the court does not recognise negative contributions and no argument has been presented by the father that any amounts withdrawn by the mother from either his account or the accounts of the children should be included on the balance sheet as an add back, or otherwise taken into consideration pursuant to s 75(2)(o) of the act.
223 in the period post separation, the mother has been solely responsible for supporting herself and the children and attending to payments of utilities and mortgage commitments on the former matrimonial home, as well as repayments on a car loan. other than child support payments of $8 per week, or $4 per child per week, the mother has received no assistance from the father. as i have noted, aside from relatively brief periods that the children have spent with the father in the period subsequent to separation, the mother has been the children’s exclusive carer. she has also paid their private school fees at a systemic catholic school.
collectively weighing contributions
224 the court is required to make an assessment of the nature and quality of the totality of the parties’ contributions throughout the entirety of their relationship, together with their contributions in the period subsequent to their separation: dickons & dickons [2012] famcafc 154, (2012) 50 fam lr 244 at 248, [14] (bryant cj, faulks dcj, murphy j), jabour & jabour [2019] famcafc 78, (2019) 59 fam lr 475 at 488, [61] (alstergren cj, ryan and aldridge jj) and dovgan & dovgan [2021] famca 306 at [347]. those cases confirm that the court is required to holistically assess contributions and that “all contributions must be weighed collectively and so it is an error to segment or compartmentalise the various contributions and weigh one against the remainder.”
225 the father is entitled to recognition for the greater initial contributions he made to the parties’ property. this is primarily in the form of the contribution of $100,000 from the sale of his suburb n property towards the purchase of the matrimonial home. that contribution must, however be assessed in the context of the totality of the parties’ contributions during their relationship and subsequent to their relationship. subject to the pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour engaged in by the father and the impact of that behaviour upon the wife, i would have made an adjustment of 6% in favour of the husband in respect to that greater initial contribution to the parties’ property.
226 i am satisfied that, from the commencement of the parties’ relationship until the mother returned to work after a period of maternity leave in 2016, the parties made equal contributions, both financial and non-financial, to the parties’ relationship. in that respect, until he ceased work in 2015, the father was the primary breadwinner and the mother was the primary homemaker and the parent primarily responsible for caring for the children.
227 i am satisfied, however, that after her return to work in 2016 and until the parties’ physical separation, the mother made greater contributions than the father insofar as she became the primary breadwinner. at the same time, i am satisfied she continued to perform the role of the primary homemaker and the parent who was primarily responsible for caring for the children.
228 i am also satisfied that the mother has made significantly greater post separation contributions in the form of direct financial contributions to the property of the parties, by way of being exclusively responsible for meeting mortgage commitments and paying utilities as well as exclusively supporting the children’s physical, emotional and intellectual needs.
229 additionally, in assessing the mother’s contributions throughout the parties’ relationship and post separation, i am satisfied that the mother’s contributions have been made significantly more arduous as result of the pattern of abusive, controlling and coercive conduct engaged in by the father against the mother, both during their relationship and post separation.
230 the principles relevant to an assessment of contributions in the context of allegations of family violence were set out in kennon v kennon [1997] famca 27, (1997) flc 92-757 (“kennon”) and further considered in s & s [2003] famca 905 (“s & s”).
231 the full court said in kennon, at 84,294:
put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79.
232 the full court, also at 84,294, emphasised that the principle should be applied with caution because:
... it is important to consider the “floodgates” argument. that is, these principles, which should only apply to exceptional cases, may become common coinage in property cases and be used inappropriately as tactical weapons or for personal attacks and so return this court to fault and misconduct in property matters - a circumstance which proved so debilitating in the past. in addition, there is the risk of substantial additional time and cost.
233 at the outset of consideration of this issue, i should firmly state my view that, in the year 2022, there is now much greater knowledge in the community as to the pernicious impact of family violence and each case should be considered on its own merits without any predetermined reluctance to do so because of fear of opening the floodgates.
234 historically, in applying the principle enunciated in kennon and s & s, a victim of family violence seeking to have their circumstances considered in a family law property matter has been required to establish that their situation gives rise to an exceptional case where:  they were subject to a course of violent conduct during the course of the marriage, (b) they demonstrate: (i) the violence had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contribution to the marriage, or (ii) the violence made his or her contribution significantly more arduous, (c) they quantify the effect of the violence on that party’s ability to contribute in terms of s 79(4)(c) of the act, (d) they adduce direct evidence about the above factors, or demonstrate there is an obvious or very likely inference from the facts that the violence had the requisite effect on the party’s ability to contribute to the marriage.   they demonstrate: (i) the violence had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contribution to the marriage, or (ii) the violence made his or her contribution significantly more arduous, (c) they quantify the effect of the violence on that party’s ability to contribute in terms of s 79(4)(c) of the act, (d) they adduce direct evidence about the above factors, or demonstrate there is an obvious or very likely inference from the facts that the violence had the requisite effect on the party’s ability to contribute to the marriage.   the violence had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contribution to the marriage, or (ii) the violence made his or her contribution significantly more arduous,  ) the violence made his or her contribution significantly more arduous,   they quantify the effect of the violence on that party’s ability to contribute in terms of s 79(4)(c) of the act, (d) they adduce direct evidence about the above factors, or demonstrate there is an obvious or very likely inference from the facts that the violence had the requisite effect on the party’s ability to contribute to the marriage.   they adduce direct evidence about the above factors, or demonstrate there is an obvious or very likely inference from the facts that the violence had the requisite effect on the party’s ability to contribute to the marriage.
235 in s & s at [42], the full court acknowledged it may be possible for the court to draw an inference that family violence perpetrated by one party to a marriage may impact upon the contributions that the other party was able to make to the property of the marriage. at [45], the full court, quoting kennon, said that inference must be “obvious” or “very likely” (emphasis added).
236 significantly, the full court in britt & britt [2017] famcafc 27, (2017) flc 93-764 (“britt”) did not limit the drawing of such an inference by those emphasised words of qualification, stating at 77,111, [74]:
the respondent submitted that the appellant’s evidence was not relevant to an issue because even if it was evidence of family violence, the appellant had called no evidence to suggest that the violence had made her contributions more onerous. this submission overlooks the obvious point that the court can infer from appropriate evidence that there was a nexus between the conduct and the relevant contributions.
237 for reasons which i explain below, the approach taken by the full court in britt is, in my view, to be preferred to the earlier authorities which suggest that there is a higher threshold to drawing such an inference in cases alleging that contributions have been made substantially more arduous as a result of family violence.
238 the supreme court of victoria, court of appeal in masters home improvement pty ltd v north east solution pty ltd [2017] vsca 88, (2017) 372 alr 440 set out the correct approach as to when it is appropriate for a trial judge to draw an inference on the basis of evidence presented in civil proceedings. at 466, [101] the court, consisting of santamaria, ferguson and kaye jja, said:
the principles, relating to the drawing of inferences in civil cases, are well established. first, any inference must be based on facts established by admissible evidence. secondly, the process of reasoning must constitute a valid inference, as distinct from speculation or guesswork. thirdly, and importantly, where the inference is drawn in favour of the party which bears the burden of proof in the case, the conclusion must be ‘the more probable inference’ from those facts. in other words, the inference drawn by the judge must be reasonably considered to have a greater degree of likelihood than any competing inference. fourthly, in determining whether an inference is to be drawn as a matter of probability, the tribunal of fact is not required to consider each primary fact, established by the evidence, in isolation. rather, the court considers the totality of those facts together, giving effect to their united and combined force. (emphasis added)
239 it is to be noted that the task of the court is to identify the “more probable” inference, not one that is necessarily “an obvious or very likely” inference.
240 in benson & drury [2020] famcafc 303, (2020) flc 93-998 (“benson & drury”), the full court observed at 80,145, [50]:
... an inference is an assent to the existence of a fact which is based on the proven existence of some other fact or facts, drawn as part of the fact finding process as an exercise of ordinary powers of deduction and reason in the light of human experience, unaffected by any rule of law (g v h [1994] hca 48, (1994) 181 clr 387 at [4]). obviously, the strength of the subject inference depends upon the quality of the underlying evidence. it must be reasonable to draw the inference from primary facts... (emphasis added)
241 the full court, in benson & drury at 80,141 [18], made it clear that the evidence of the nature of violence perpetrated against the victim may be such that, even without expert evidence, a trial judge undertaking appropriate forensic analysis might infer that the violence had a discernible impact on the victim, such that it made the victim’s contributions “significantly more arduous” than they ought to have been.
242 further, at 80,145 [49] of benson & drury, the full court said:
even though s & s might, in the past, have been interpreted as implying the need for something more, it should now be clear that the required nexus between proven family violence and the significant adverse effect upon the contributions of the victim is capable of being inferred from the lay evidence of the parties (maine v maine [2016] famcafc 270, (2016) 56 fam lr 500 at [47]–[52], britt & britt [2017] famcafc 27, (2017) flc 93-764 at [74]–[75], keating at [27]–[43], [52]–[67]).
243 a similar approach has been taken by judges of the supreme courts of new south wales and victoria in considering the impact of family violence on a party’s contributions to a domestic relationship.
244 in hughes v egger [2005] nswsc 18 (“hughes”), white j of the supreme court of new south wales rejected the argument that there was, on the facts of that case, an absence of evidence of the impact of domestic violence. his honour, at [151], said:
... i think it is self-evident that the contributions made by the defendant as a homemaker were more arduous by reason of the fact that the person for whom she was working about the house descended, on occasion, to such conduct. it is a factor which increases the weight to be given to her role as a homemaker.
245 in giller v procopets [2008] vsca 236, (2008) 24 vr 1, neave ja, referring to the decision of white j in hughes, held at 70, [299] that it was, on the facts of that case, “self-evident” that the existence of both verbal and physical abuse suffered by the mother “would have made it significantly more difficult for her to discharge her role as homemaker and parent.”
246 a similar approach was taken by vickery j in morgan v bell [2011] vsc 302 where his honour held at [245] that it was “self-evident” the violent conduct to which the victim was subject “would have made it more difficult for her to discharge her role” as a homemaker and mother.
247 i am satisfied that the history of verbal abuse suffered by the mother, together with the pattern of coercive and controlling behaviour to which i have earlier referred including, significantly, the electronic surveillance of the mother undertaken by the father, made her role as a homemaker and mother significantly more arduous. that inference can readily be made on the balance of probabilities in the context where myself and counsel involved in these proceedings witnessed the unacceptable, erratic, dysregulated and, at times, aggressive conduct by the father during the course of these proceedings. the father’s insults of the mother made during the course of these proceedings is entirely consistent with the mother’s evidence that he engaged in a similar pattern of abuse during the course of their relationship. significantly, the mother was not challenged on her evidence that the father engaged in electronic surveillance of her movements and also in her own home. save to the extent that it must be considered in the context of the father’s greater initial contribution, i would have made an adjustment of 8% in favour of the mother as a result of the matters to which i have referred that fall within the principles initially adumbrated in kennon as modified by the subsequent authorities to which i have referred.
while recognising the significantly greater initial contribution of the father to the parties’ property, having regard to the totality of contributions made by the mother as a homemaker and parent and that such contributions were made significantly more arduous by the pattern of abusive, coercive and controlling behaviour engaged in by the father, i am satisfied that an adjustment pursuant to s 79(4) of 2 per cent in favour of the mother is appropriate. to be clear, the impact of that conduct on the mother, which i have assessed as justifying an 8 per cent adjustment in her favour is such that it essentially cancels out and exceeds the adjustment that i otherwise would have made in favour of the father as a result of his greater initial contribution of 6 per cent percent with the resulting adjustment to the mother being 2 per cent pursuant to s 79(4) considerations. relevant s 75(2) factors pursuant to s 79(4)(e)
subsection (2)(a) – the age and state of health of each of the parties
248 the mother is 41 years of age and suffers from a degenerative condition in her back, necessitating her taking some pain relief on a daily basis. the mother reported to dr e at paragraph 15 of the report that she has degenerative discs and has had three fractures in her back. the father acknowledges the mother has had surgery for her back problem.
249 the mother acknowledges that she has had, in the past, mental health challenges but she was not challenged on her evidence as set out in paragraph 122 of her affidavit that her mental health issues, which include the impact of post-traumatic stress disorder and depression, are being appropriately managed.
250 to her credit, the mother does not contend that her back injury has impacted upon her employability or working capacity.
251 the father is 45 years of age and, as noted, suffered from a carpel tunnel injury to his right wrist which has been the subject of surgery.
subsection (2)(b) – the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment
252 at paragraph 150 of his affidavit, the father attested that he continues to suffer pain in his right arm due to his workplace injury. however, in her report dated 12 october 2021, dr e noted at paragraph 21 that the father reported to her that “he did not have any physical health issues of note”. dr e further records at paragraph 6 of the father advising her that he had “engaged in multiple different roles, including work at factories, customer relations, and trades.”
253 at paragraph 152 of his affidavit, the father attested to being unable to work on a full-time basis and that he did not envisage that would be a future possibility. during the course of cross-examination, the father indicated an intention to obtain a transport workers license, with which he anticipates being in a position to obtain employment in that capacity with earning prospects of $200,000 per year.
254 the father has produced no evidence to support the extent of the injury to his right hand and arm, which is acknowledged by the mother to have occurred. in the absence of evidence from a qualified medical practitioner as to the nature of the father’s injury and the impact that it has on the functioning of his arm and hand, the father’s assessment that he lacks capacity for full-time employment is inadmissible opinion evidence. in that context, the father has failed to provide evidence of attempting to obtain employment or trialling particular employment to ascertain how he can cope with what he claims to be the effects of the injury to his right hand and arm.
255 in contrast to the father’s assertions regarding his inability to obtain full time employment, during the course of these proceedings the father acknowledged that he owns and has the capacity to ride a high-powered motorcycle, despite his claimed injury to his hand and wrist.
256 the mother, to her credit, did not seek to take advantage of the assertion by the father that he has a potential earning capacity of $200,000 as a transport worker, which she acknowledged to be an unrealistic aspiration on his part. the mother was not challenged on her evidence, however, that during the course of the parties’ relationship, and in the period subsequent to the father sustaining his hand injury, she has observed him undertakings tasks including landscaping, basic construction work and garden maintenance. the mother further attests that the father, who is a qualified tradesman, has assisted family and friends to install and repair systems in their homes. the mother was not challenged on that evidence.
257 having regard to the manner in which he presented in these proceedings, the father’s assertion that he has the capacity to potentially earn $200,000 working as a transport worker is, with respect, fanciful. i am nonetheless satisfied that the father has a significant earning capacity which he is currently failing to utilise.
258 in circumstances where, prior to the father ceasing work in 2015, he was earning an income comparable to that of the mother, i am satisfied that the parties both have an earning capacity which is approximately equivalent.
subsection (2)(c) – whether either party has the care or control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years
259 the most relevant s 75(2) factor in these proceedings is the fact that, pursuant to these orders, the mother will have the sole care and control of the parties’ children. during the course of the proceedings the father was adamant that, aside from paying the very small amount of child support which he is required to pay, he will not provide any further assistance to the mother or the children, including assisting the mother in respect of the children’s school fees.
subsections (2)(d) and (e) – commitments of each of the parties that are necessary to enable the party to support himself or herself, and a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain, and the responsibilities of either party to support any other person
260 the father attests that he has recently commenced living with his new partner and her children. the father’s evidence in respect to the employment circumstances of his partner was unsatisfactorily unclear. it appears, however, that until recently, the father’s partner had regular work in the allied health sector. the father’s financial statement has not disclosed the income of his partner, nor has he provided evidence as to the extent to which that income can be applied towards meeting some of his expenses.
261 the father did not contend that he is supporting his current partner, other than to the extent that he stated he lent his current partner some money, but that has been repaid.
262 other than the mother’s ongoing commitments to support the parties’ children, it was not contended that either party has an obligation to support any other person.
subsection (2)(f) – the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under any law of the commonwealth, of a state or territory or of another country, or any superannuation fund or scheme, whether the fund or scheme was established, or operates, within or outside australia, and the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party
263 the father is currently receiving social security benefits. i have not had regard to those benefits in assessing an appropriate s 75(2) adjustment, in circumstances where i have previously assessed that the father has an income earning capacity equivalent to that of the mother.
subsection (2)(g) – where the parties have separated or divorced, a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable
264 the father is only responsible for supporting himself, whereas the mother has, since february 2016, supported the family until the parties’ separation and, in the period subsequent to the parties’ separation, supported herself and the children. in circumstances where her income has been relatively modest, the standard of living for herself and the children has also been modest. the mother was not challenged on her evidence that meeting day to day expenses, including the children’s education, can be a struggle.
265 additionally, i am satisfied that it is likely the father still has a sizeable portion of the lump sum disability benefit and superannuation payment which he received available to utilise to meet his day-to-day expenses and to purchase items of property to enhance his standard of living and recreational activities. i draw that inference in circumstances where the mother has provided evidence of amounts that had been deposited in the father’s o investment account, the funds held in the father’s o superannuation account and how the father has failed to disclose how those funds have been applied.
subsection (2)(h) – the extent to which the payment of maintenance to the party whose maintenance is under consideration would increase the earning capacity of that party by enabling that party to undertake a course of education or training or to establish himself or herself in a business or otherwise to obtain an adequate income
266 i have not regarded this consideration as being relevant.
subsection (2)(ha) – the effect of any proposed order on the ability of a creditor of a party to recover the creditor’s debt, so far as that effect is relevant
267 i have not regarded this consideration as being relevant.
subsection (2)(j) – the extent to which the party whose maintenance is under consideration has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other party
268 i am satisfied that, in the period subsequent to her return to work in 2016, the mother received some assistance from the father in caring for the children at those times that she was at work. the father is entitled to some recognition for that.
subsection (2)(k) – the duration of the marriage and the extent to which it has affected the earning capacity of the party whose maintenance is under consideration
269 i have earlier set out the periods that the mother took by way of maternity leave. there is no indication, however, that the mother’s earnings or any capacity has been impacted by those periods of leave.
subsection (2)(l) – the need to protect a party who wishes to continue that party’s role as a parent
270 the mother wishes to continue to be the children’s primary carer and, for reasons which i have earlier set out, having regard to the presentation and conduct of the father, it is imperative that she remains the children’s primary carer into the future.
subsection (2)(m) – if either party is cohabiting with another person—the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation
271 the father has failed to disclose the financial circumstances of his current partner with whom he has resided for a period of approximately one month prior to the date of the hearing.
subsection (2)(n) – the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 79 in relation to the property of the parties, or vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party
272 i have earlier set out the adjustment which i make to the parties’ property, which favours the mother by 52 per cent to 48 per cent to the father.
subsection (2)(naa) – the terms of any order or declaration made, or proposed to be made, under part viiiab in relation to a party to the marriage, or a person who is a party to a de facto relationship with a party to the marriage, or the property of or vested bankruptcy property in relation to a person covered by the categories aforementioned
273 i have not regarded this as a relevant consideration.
subsection (2)(na) – any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the marriage has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the marriage
274 the father has met his ongoing child support obligations to the extent of approximately $8 per week, or $4 per child. the father indicated he would continue to meet that obligation. he firmly stated, however, that he refuses to make any additional contributions to the expenses of the children.
subsection (2)(o) – any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account
275 most relevant, in terms of this consideration, is the failure by the father to disclose how he has applied funds which he has received by way of a lump sum disability benefit and also lump sum superannuation. in that respect, it is noted that in march 2020 the balance of funds in the father’s bank o investment account was $234,000. in his financial statement filed 15 july 2021, the balance in that bank o investment account was $200,000. in his financial statement filed 4 april 2022, the father stated that he had a nominal amount in a bank u account and did not declare any other property, save for his interest in the former matrimonial home. the father has failed to account for funds that had been held in his bank o investment account, which i have noted as at 15 july 2021 totalled $200,000, save to the extent that he attested to paying approximately $50,000 in legal fees.
276 additionally, records produced by the bank o superannuation fund establish that, as at 22 february 2021, the father had a balance of $231,725.55 and that reduced to $117,230.24 by 3 september 2021. no explanation has been provided by the father as to how those funds have been applied.
277 until approximately one month prior to the hearing, the father was living with his parents and paying $50 rent per week from his newstart allowance of $300 per week. this, on its face, left a balance of $250 per week to be applied to day-to-day living expenses. in those circumstances, it is implausible that the father could have exhausted the funds held in his bank o investment account or his superannuation fund solely on day-to-day living expenses. further, while the father said he provided some funds to his current partner, he attested that those funds have since been repaid to him.
278 in graf-salzmann & graf [2015] fcwa 68 at [287], walters j noted:
... a judge is entitled to take a “robust view” in relation to findings regarding a party’s financial position (including a party’s capacity to meet any proposed order) where that party has failed to make full and frank disclosure of his/her financial position: see chang v su [2002] famca 156, (2002) flc 93-117 at [71] and [72].
279 in efthimiadis & efthimiadis [1993] famca 15, (1993) flc 92-361 at 79,804, the full court said:
so far as the wife is concerned, there is no doubt that she should be treated as substantially understating her income... the circumstance that the wife had a significantly greater income that she deposed to was very damaging to her on issues of credit overall and virtually ensured that she was put out of court so far as s75(2) factors were concerned.
280 as noted in goddard elliott v fritsch [2012] vsc 87 at [894]–[895] by bell j:
when it comes to making findings on the evidence, the non-disclosure of a party, and the appropriation by a party of matrimonial property for themselves, may be taken into account when making findings on the evidence. the applicable principle was enunciated in in the marriage of weir:
this court has pointed out in a line of cases leading up to the recent decision of the full court, ... that it is the duty of a party involved in property proceedings in this jurisdiction to make a full disclosure of their financial affairs.... it is clear enough from his honour’s findings in the present case that the husband had not done so and had in fact pocketed the proceeds of a substantial number of cash sales. it is obvious that in most cases of this nature it is difficult enough for the other party to establish that fact let alone establish the quantum of what has been taken. it seems to us that once it has been established that there has been a deliberate non disclosure, which follows from his honour’s findings in this case, then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. to do otherwise might be thought to provide a charter for fraud in proceedings of this nature.
it can be seen that the non-disclosure, like an adverse finding as to credit, is a reason “not to be unduly cautious” about making findings in favour of the innocent party. but it is not a basis, upon its own, for deciding an application against the non-disclosing party. there must be “an underlying body of evidence from which such conclusions can be drawn”. in cases of non-disclosure, the court must still do the best it can, even if the findings have to be imprecise, further, the court may “err on the side of generosity to the party who might be otherwise be [sic] seen to be disadvantaged by the lack of complete candour”. (citations omitted)
281 applying those authorities, i am satisfied that the mother is entitled to an additional adjustment of some significance in light of the father’s failure to provide proper disclosure of his financial circumstances. to avoid doubt, in taking into account the father’s non-disclosure of how those funds have been applied, i have not included the amount of $50,000 which the father attested to having paid for legal fees in respect to these proceedings and which has been included as a notional add back on the balance sheet.
subsections (2)(p) and (q) – the terms of any financial agreement and any part viiiab financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the marriage
282 this consideration is not relevant.
evaluation of s 75(2) factors
283 the most relevant consideration in determining whether there should be an adjustment pursuant to s 75(2) is that the mother will, pursuant to these orders, continue as the children’s primary carer. based on the evidence to which i have referred, i am satisfied she will receive minimal support from the father, with that support being limited to his basic child support obligations. the children are very young and the financial obligation of raising the children will be carried by the mother at least until the children turn 18 years of age.
284 additionally, the mother is entitled to a significant adjustment in circumstances where the father has failed to disclose how he has applied funds that had been held in his bank o investment account and how he has applied funds that had been held in his bank o superannuation fund.
285 having regard to those matters, i am satisfied that the mother is entitled to an additional adjustment of 18 per cent in her favour. in circumstances where i have found the parties’ property pool available for distribution, inclusive of superannuation, to be $661,865, this results in the mother receiving an additional amount of $119,136. while not insubstantial in the context of the parties’ combined asset pool, that amount is nonetheless significantly less than funds received by the husband by way of superannuation and disability payment, the disbursement of which has been inadequately disclosed.
overall evaluation
286 i have adopted the one pool approach when determining what is a just and equitable adjustment of the parties’ property. that is, i have determined to include the parties’ superannuation in the one pool of property such that it constitutes property that is already in each party’s possession. in so deciding, i have had regard to the principles adumbrated in c & c, wherein the majority of the full court said at 79,646, [63]:
...we consider that the preferred approach to the determination of property settlement cases must be to prepare in addition to the list of items of property (which would clearly fall within the definition of that term in s 4(1)), a separate list containing any superannuation interest or interests (valued according to the regulations if a splitting order is sought in any application before the court or if no such order is sought that either according to the regulations or otherwise).
287 in drewett & drewett [2012] famca 320, cronin j at [185]–[188] noted, by reference to c & c, that:
their honours said that whether or not a splitting order was sought on either party's application, their contributions to both the property as defined in s 4(1) and also the superannuation interests should be assessed. the other factors in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g) would then need to be considered. the s 75(2) factors would then be considered. similarly, the parties' future superannuation prospects, be they in capital or income form, would also need to be considered. the overall justice and equity of the ultimate award, including any proposed splitting order or the need for such an order, would then be considered. the full court then went on to set out how that pathway was to be followed. their honours then said:
in the context of the consideration of the matters referred to in subparagraphs (b) and (c) of a preceding paragraph in which they referred to the pathway the following matters may be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation, actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation (if applicable) at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse's present and/or future entitlements under the fund.
their honours then said:
if this approach is adopted whereby superannuation interests are dealt with separately from properties defined in s 4, but are subject to the considerations in s 79(4) then not only will any contributions both direct and indirect by either party to such superannuation interests be more likely to be given property recognition, but the real nature of the superannuation interests in question can also be taken into account both in consideration of the s 75(2) matters and in the final assessment of whether the ultimate order is just and equitable.
the full court referred to the real nature of the relevant superannuation interest and by that they were referring to not just the value of the superannuation interests according to the regulations but also the relevant value to the party in the future. in this case, the parties have obtained and agreed upon the valuations of their respective interests and it was not suggested that i should examine what those interests will mean for them in the future. initially therefore, i propose to simply assess their respective contributions and then make adjustments separately. (citations omitted)
288 despite the fact that it will be a number of years before either party is likely to access their superannuation entitlements, no argument has been presented as to why the court should apply anything other than the agreed valuations of their respective interests as being property in each of their possession. moreover, the court has not been provided with evidence that addresses those matters set out in the recommended pathway described by the full court in c & c. accordingly, the parties’ superannuation will fall as it is. that is, the mother will retain superannuation in her name and the father will retain superannuation in his name.
289 for reasons which i have set, out i am satisfied that there should be an adjustment in favour of the mother of 2 per cent having regard to s 79(4) considerations and 18 per cent having regard to s 75(2) considerations, making a total adjustment in favour of the mother of 20 per cent.
290 this results in the mother being entitled to 70 per cent of the amount of $661,865 (including superannuation), which is equivalent to $463,305. comparatively, the father is entitled to $198,560.
291 in circumstances where the mother will be the primary carer of the parties’ children, i am satisfied that it is appropriate that the mother be given the first option of acquiring the full title of the former matrimonial home by making an appropriate cash adjustment to the father.
292 according to the agreed balance sheet, the father currently has in his possession a motor vehicle 2 worth $5,000. in addition, he has superannuation funds agreed at $110,289. additionally, i have determined that, in circumstances where the father has had the benefit of paying $50,000 for legal fees by using the matrimonial property, that amount should be credited as funds utilised by the father. accordingly, with superannuation, the motor vehicle and funds notionally added back to the balance sheet, the father has and has had the benefit of a total amount of $165,289.
293 in circumstances where the father’s 30 per cent entitlement of disclosed property is $198,560, the mother will be required to make a cash adjustment to the father totalling $33,271.
294 this will leave the mother with the former matrimonial home, worth $650,000, and she will also have her superannuation entitlement worth $85,347. she will also retain the motor vehicle 1. the mother will have, however, the ongoing responsibility of meeting the mortgage on the former matrimonial home in the sum of $249,096. additionally, the mother will have the responsibility of meeting the repayments on the motor vehicle 1 in the sum of $24,675. she will also be left with the additional responsibility of raising the sum of $33,271 to pay to the father.
295 while these orders result in the mother receiving the major portion of the parties’ property which has been disclosed, for reasons which i have set out above, it can reasonably be inferred that the father has, or has had, the benefit of funds previously held in his bank o investment account and his bank o superannuation fund. as noted, other than in respect to legal fees, the father has failed to provide disclosure as to what has happened to those funds.
296 additionally, in proposed orders 29 and 30 of the mother’s further amended response, she proposes the division of the parties’ property which has not been included in the balance sheet. that property appears to be in the nature of personal items and not of substantial value. the father was not heard to speak against that proposed division of the parties’ personal property and personal effects as proposed by the mother. in circumstances where the orders proposed by the mother appear to be reasonable and are likely to minimise the prospect of further litigation, i propose making orders in terms of those proposed by the mother.
orders and costs
297 accordingly, for all these reasons i make the orders as set out at the commencement of these reasons for judgment.
298 in the event of the mother wishing to apply for an order for costs, she will be entitled to make written submissions supporting such an order within 14 days of the date of these orders. in the event of the father opposing such an order he will have an additional period of 14 days to respond.
