the father’s oral evidence
the mother’s oral evidence
financial matters
evidence of the mother’s psychologist
while ms kester has good coping skills, the present situation has proven overwhelming for her, requiring her to seek additional support from family, community, and her psychologist. the best place for ms kester to be living at this time is in town b where she can readily access family, community and psychological support. removal from these supports is likely to be detrimental to her mental health, and have a negative impact on her ability to provide the optimum conditions for her and her children to thrive.

parenting proceedings – legal principles
best interests of the child
the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
section 65daa(1) is expressed in imperative terms. it obliges the court to consider both the question whether it is in the best interests of the child to spend equal time with each of the parents (para (a)) and the question whether it is reasonably practicable that the child spend equal time with each of them (para (b)). it is only where both questions are answered in the affirmative that consideration may be given, under para (c), to the making of an order. the words in which para (c) commences (if it is) refer back to the two preceding questions and make plain that the making of an order can only be considered if the findings mentioned are made. a determination as a question of fact that it is reasonably practicable that equal time be spent with each court has the power to make a parenting order of that kind. it is a matter upon which power is conditioned much as it is where a jurisdictional fact must be proved to exist. if such a finding cannot be made, subs (2)(a) and (b) require that the prospect of the child spending substantial and significant time with each parent then be considered. that subsection follows the same structure as subs (1) and requires the same questions concerning the child’s best interests and reasonable practicability to be answered in the context of the child spending substantial and significant time with each parent.
section 65daa(1) is concerned with the reality of the situation of the parents and the child, not whether it is desirable that there be equal time spent by the child with each parent. the presumption in s 61da(1) is not determinative of the questions arising under s 65daa(1). section 65daa(1)(b) requires a practical assessment of whether equal time parenting is feasible.
we agree that when dealing with a case concerning the future living arrangements for a child, and involving a significant change in the geographical place where the child is to live, the preferred approach according to established principle has been not to deal with that change, or relocation, as a separate or discrete issue, but rather as just one of the proposals for the child’s future living arrangements, as least in so far as that approach is possible (see u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238, (2002) flc 93-112 and kb & tc [2005] famca 458, (2005) flc 93-224). however consistently with what the full court said in goode, the options of the child spending “equal time” or “substantial and significant time” with each parent must now be given separate and real consideration, notwithstanding that a relocation proposal may also have to be given subsequent consideration, with the advantages and disadvantages of that proposal then being balanced against the advantages and disadvantages of an” equal time” or “substantial and significant time” arrangement. not to approach a case involving a relocation proposal in this way, would devalue the imperative imposed by the act to consider whether it is in the best interests of a child in a case to spend “equal time” or “substantial and significant time” with each parents.
parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children. only when the children’s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent’s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children’s best interests. (citations omitted)
we accept that the availability of family support including such things as reliable quality child care, financial assistance, and emotional support for a parent and a child, can be very important considerations in any parenting case particularly one involving relocation, and are all matters to be balanced and weighed when considering competing proposals. but those factors, or a lack of them, do not automatically support a finding that a party’s parenting capacity will be compromised particularly when they may be counterbalanced, at least in part, by other benefits, including the sharing of day to day care of a child. again, we find merit in this ground.
