the section 11f memorandum 6 july 2021
that assessment is a “child inclusive conference” which is a meeting with a family consultant, the adults and the children involved in the matter and is ordered by the court. lawyers are not included. the conference is intended to give the court an understanding of the family situation, and particularly of the child/ren’s experience. the conference can help the judicial officer hearing the case make short-term decisions about arrangements for the child/ren. it may also help the parties reach an agreement. a family consultant is an expert psychologist or social worker with a high level of training and experience in child development and parenting after separation and divorce. family consultants are employed directly and exclusively by the court in child dispute services which is located within the registry.
... [the mother] acknowledged that given the poor relationship between the children and herself, it would be detrimental for a change in residence to occur. she was concerned for the long term impacts of [the father] and [ms e] engaging the children in adult discussions and information. she was concerned for [the father’s] capacity to encourage and facilitate a relationship between the children and herself noting that she has had no contact with [child 1] for almost two years and with [child 2] for one year. she acknowledged the high conflict between herself and [child 1] previously and identified that in hind sight she could have handled some situations differently.
... [the father] expressed concern for the long term impact of [the mother’s] highly conflictual parenting style on the children’s emotional wellbeing. he reported that the children were emotionally burdened due to [the mother’s] use of “manipulation”, which eventually led to [child 1] living with him in 2019, and [child 2] following in july 2020. [the father] held a strong view that the children needed a break from contact with their mother, in order to be allowed the opportunity to heal from their past experiences and that a re-introduction of time with [the mother] at this stage, would likely be detrimental to their future emotional wellbeing. he alleged that [the mother] failed to adhere to previous court orders and caused the children significant instability by unilaterally removing them from their schools and relocating to a different area.
... given their ages, the children have a very short window of opportunity to maintain a relationship with their mother. if this opportunity is not fostered by [the father] as their primary parent, there remains a risk of the children internalising the issues they have experienced with [the mother] and may have poor outcomes for their long term mental health. the children are having no face to face contact with their maternal family and there appears to be a heavy presence from the paternal family. the children need to have an opportunity for some connection to their maternal family in order to maintain a sense of balance and neutrality. [the mother] will need to engage in significant efforts to acknowledge how her past behaviour has hurt the children and damaged her relationship with them, only then can there be successful repair and reconnection. it is beyond the scope of the parents in this matter to assist and facilitate this occurring and the family may subsequently benefit from engaging with professional support to achieve this. the children in this matter are presenting with systems fatigue, due to their involvement in past and current court processes. ... the children will benefit from engaging with a child psychologist as a matter of urgency, specialising in family law matters. the re-introduction of spend time would need to be determined by the children’s progress with the child psychologist, as a premature introduction of spend time may further exacerbate [child 1] and [child 2’s] rejection of their mother. the children will benefit from receiving overt permission and genuine encouragement to spend time with [the mother], from [the father].

... both parents completed the pai. ... [the father’s] profile indicated he engaged in positive impression management at least one standard deviation above the mean for parents involved in child custody disputes. his high score on this scale indicates he attempted to portray himself as exceptionally free of common shortcomings most people will admit, leading to his profile likely being questionable. such a high score on this scale is rare and this raises concerns for [the father’s] level of defensiveness. ... [child 1] explained at interview that her father was [nationality] and she wanted to travel overseas. she presented as directive and assured in her thoughts and feelings and was frustrated she was again telling her story and involved in court proceedings. [child 1] explained she believed she was performing better academically since residing with her father. (her mother stated she has always performed well at school). [child 1] reported her poor grades to be due to her mother not providing a stable living environment and moving house regularly. she said, ‘i don’t know how i got by day-to-day academically’, and ‘she never enforced anything’. throughout the interviews, [child 1] called her mother ‘[the mother’s first name]’, and said the reason being is that she ‘does not see her as a mother figure’. [child 1] was visibly upset and frustrated reliving the past and giving accounts of her experiences. she stated she wanted to move on with her life (free from her mother). furthermore, she is requesting that her decision to not spend time or communicate with her mother be respected by both [the mother] and the court. thus, [child 1] is not seeking therapy or reunification. she outlined the reasons for this decision and described cumulative events over the years that has led to this decision to not have a relationship with her mother. initially she recalled being a ‘nice girl and blocking it out’. however, she is now advocating that it is in her best interests to not repair the relationship with her mother. ... [child 1] appeared angry at her mother, presenting with fixed views with little room for any good feelings or experiences of their relationship. she stated, ‘mum plays the victim’, and often brought her father into their arguments by saying comments such as ‘your father never pays child support’, leaving her feeling angry and upset. [child 1] said she ‘hated being brought into the conflict’. [child 1] acknowledged she felt ‘ashamed’ about behaving this way and having friendship issues when she lived with her mother. she reported her past emotional and interpersonal difficulties were due to her mother being ‘dramatic’. she also blamed her mother ‘for never doing anything about it’. it appears the mother tried to get [child 1] assessed to understand more about her experiences from a specialist. [child 1] spoke about the experience of arguing with her mother and being made to feel like a crazy angry person. [child 1] agreed she become angry due to her mother refusing to give her space and continued arguing. at the interview she was upset by the allegations her mother had made about her father, for example ‘your dad beat and hit me’, ‘left us with no money for groceries’. [child 1] defended her father stating, ‘my dad would never do that’. ... ... further to this, [child 1] said she didn’t hate her mother and believed her mother knew why both her and brother felt the way they did. despite thinking this, [child 1] said she would write a letter to her mother after christmas explaining to her why she didn’t want to have a relationship with her. ... in regard to his father and stepmother supporting a relationship with his mother, [child 2] said ‘they want us to have a relationship with her and ask us to call her’. however, he said ‘i want to cut off all cords’ as she was ‘not honest and sincere’, and he stated he didn’t have close relationship with her, and that she caused him a lot of anxiety. [child 2] appeared worried he would have to go back to live with his mother and the writer explained his mother was just seeking some sort of visitation. he appeared shocked by this news and said he didn’t know, and then said she needed to wait until he was ready. [child 2] appeared more genuine at this point of the interview. however, after the session with the writer [the mother] reported to the writer that [child 2] had sent her repeated poo emojis. when the writer asked [child 2] about this in a subsequent session, he appeared embarrassed and then said ‘wait, it must have been a mistake’. ... he said he had not made his decision yet about seeing his mother to work through the issues, and stated he had felt ‘flung off by her’. he also reported wanting to see [child 3] and recommence calls with her when he was at his dad’s house. in summary, [child 2] cannot remember his parents being together. he said ‘i don’t hate my mother, i still love her in a way’. it appeared [child 2] felt frustrated and angry at his mother, and this was leading to a defensive fixed position, however, in relation to his mother he had more ambivalence (mixed feelings) than his sister [child 1], and underneath the involvement of the conflict he appeared to have good feelings and love towards his mother. ... unfortunately, the parents have not been able to work through the destructive communication patterns and unhelpful dynamics of their parental relationship which has led to the children taking sides. the accusations of both parents against each other over the years led [child 1] to feel anxiety, angry outbursts, and somatic complaints (stomach aches), and then to resolve the conflict by a rejection of their mother and alignment with her father. the children have extended their rejection to the extended maternal family. [child 2] appears to more open to working through the conflict with his mother, but he will struggle to go against the fixed position of the paternal family. to continue any further individual sessions with the children is likely to exacerbate the children’s hostility to therapy. the writer spoke with the children about their mother acknowledging her emotional failings over the years, as well as being remorseful and wanting the opportunity to work through the issues. however, [child 1] rejected this idea and concretely stated her mother was not capable of change, labelling her mother with a personality disorder and herself the daughter of a narcissist. she concluded that her mother would not listen or be sincere. the pai did not indicate the mother has any traits or indications of a personality disorder, she is likely to be submissive in relationships and will struggle to assert herself appropriately in conflict. there was also no indication [the mother] engaged in positive impression management, thus she responded in a transparent manner. [child 2] was more open to the thought of resolving the issue with his mother (when he felt ready), he has already taken the required ‘breathing space he sought’. however, to not align with his current family system will be too difficult for him. the interactions between [child 1] and her mother appear to have been difficult for the mother to contain and manage at various developmental stages, particularly at age two and during adolescence. [child 1] has felt pathologised by her mother who spoke of [child 1] having autism-like tendencies, [child 1] is now diagnosing her mother. [child 1] reports her earlier experiences of frustration and anger were due to the dysfunctional interactions with her mother and not being seen in her own right. in terms of [child 1] forming a healthy adult self, it is recommended she move forward and form a new relationship with her mother and resolve the conflict in a healthier way. [child 1] is requesting to sever all ties and disown her mother. however, this relationship is a relationship she has internalised, and she has defined herself as being the daughter of a narcissist. i recommend the court considers ordering the family to attend an intensive family therapy program with [dr m], followed by the children and mother attending face to face therapy to enable real-time contact with the mother. the writer believes only an intensive family therapy-based treatment program such as the one offered by [dr m] may assist this family. [dr m] offers a unique family therapy model where she works intensively with families for 4 days to assist families when children reject a parent or in alienation cases. ... recommendations the writer would respectfully make the following recommendations based upon her assessment and dependent upon relevant findings of fact, as outlined in the body of the report, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary:
the court may consider ordering the family (parents and children) to attend upon [dr m’s] 4-day intensive family therapy program. the court may consider ordering joint therapy for the children and the mother on a regular basis. (for the children to have separate sessions). for [the father] and [ms e] to be prohibited from discussing the therapy with the children and comply with all directions in the children’s attendance in person for therapy. at the direction of the therapist, for [child 3] to also attend. for the mother to attend insight-oriented therapy, to address her family of origin, adolescence, and parenting triggers. the writer notes the father has been requesting the children’s passports to see extended family. once the family therapy with [dr m] has been completed the court may need to address the issue of the children’s passport and travel.  phasis added]

father’s affidavit
... ... the children refused to return home despite my encouragement to the contrary. ... .... [mr d] and i have been facilitating calls between [child 3] and the children to maintain the relationship, however this was stopped by [the mother]. ... ... i would be more than happy for the children to spend time and communicate with [the maternal grandmother] as i would be with [the mother], however unfortunately they have not made the effort to contact the children or initiate this. ... ... i agree completely the importance of preparing and developing these relationships.
we are instructed that the child [child 2] is insistent that he does not wish to return to your client’s care this coming monday 3 august 2020. our client has sought to counsel [child 2] about the need to comply with the agreed week about arrangement, however [child 2] is adamant that he does not wish to return to your client’s care at this stage. our client will continue to assess the situation and encourage [child 2] to go with our client on monday. however, in the event that [child 2] remains steadfast in his position, then there is little that our client can do (given [child 2’s] age) to force his to go. therefore, if [child 2] continues to refuse to return to your client’s care, then our client proposes that [child 2] remain with him for a further week, upon which the parties can then re-assess the situation.
exhibit m2: the father’s solicitors email after dr c’s report release
our office has spoken to [dr m] who has confirmed that her fee for the four day intensive course is $15,500 (as recommended by [dr c]), and to next available date is not until august 2022. ... despite the children adamantly stating to our client, your client (and to an extent [dr c]) that they do not wish to engage in any further therapy sessions, our client remains willing to participate in ongoing therapy, and to encourage and facilitate the children to do so. however, any such therapy will need to be either funded entirely by your client or court/government funded. if your client is unwilling or unable to fund the therapy sessions with [dr m], then we ask that your office and/or the independent children’s lawyer provide suggestions as to how this matter may otherwise progress. further, we also ask that your client provide details as to the ultimate outcome that she is seeking to achieve in continuing with this litigation. ... [emphasis added]
the parent’s financial statements
submissions at hearing
mr wightman: so in summary, those are the three issues are really, the fatigue, and the children have clearly expressed in their wishes. they are 17, 15. by the time a report with [dr m] comes around, [child 1] will be, you know, nudging 18, and [child 2] will be nudging 16. the – you know, it’s our position that they have clearly expressed those opinions. ... at this point, they’re [done so in] ... various forms to various people ... it would be detrimental, essentially, to their health, to proceed with continued therapy. and, ... both the children are old enough, ... [their] decision should be given significant weight. and otherwise the concept of this being the last-ditch effort ... we submit it’s not the case, and the father will continue to want to encourage and facilitate relationships in the future.
if the parties agree to facilitate the children’s attendance upon [dr m] for intensive family therapy, then the independent children’s lawyer will not stand in their way. if the children’s participation in [dr m’s] intensive family therapy is not practically possible, then the independent children’s lawyer propose the following final orders: all extant applications be dismissed and all previous parenting orders be discharged. the mother and the father have equal shared parental responsibility of the children, [child 1] born in 2005 and [child 2] born in 2007 (“the children”). the children live with the father. the children communicate and spend time with their mother pursuant to their wishes. the mother may provide the children with letters, gifts and cards from time to time. such other orders as agreed between the parties in relation to parental communication, authorities to communicate with third parties about the children, and the children’s passports. ... further family therapy it is the independent children’s lawyer’s submission that a greater weight should be given to the children’s expressed wishes not to participate in further therapeutic counselling to talk about their relationship (or lack thereof) with their mother, or to be required to communicate and/or spend time with their mother for the following reasons: if the children are required to participate in the intensive family therapy with [dr m] in august 2022, [child 1] would be 17 years and 7 months, and [child 2] would be 15 years and 5 months old. both children are older teenagers with strong views. [child 1] has explicitly expressed her views to [dr c] (at paragraph 31 of [dr c’s] report) and in her letter to her mother dated 15 december 2021 (annexed to the mother’s affidavit at page 25) that she does not wish to communicate or spend time with her mother, and that she does not seek therapy or reunification with her mother. although [child 2] has not outright rejected his mother, he expressed a desire for space away from these current proceedings. [dr c] noted that although [dr c] is open to the thought of resolving the issue with his mother when he felt ready, it would be difficult for him not to align with his current family system (being the conflict between the mother and [child 1]) (paragraph 41). the children have been subjected to three separate legal proceedings in relation to parenting matters. from 2011 to the present, the children have been interviewed by: three family consultants ([dr k] in 2012, family consultant [suburb n] in 2016, and [child expert consultant o] in 2021), a child consultant [p] from q centre, and two psychologists ([psychologist p] in 2015 and [dr c] in 2021).
the above list of experts does not include [dr m] as recommended by [dr c] and should this matter proceed to a final hearing, a fourth family consultant. [child expert consultant o] stated in the child inclusive report in july 2021 that “the children in this matter are presenting with systems fatigue, due to their involvement in past and current court processes” (paragraph 29). it is the icl’s submission that both parties should turn their minds to concluding these legal proceedings sooner rather than later as further protracted litigation would be detrimental to the children’s mental health and well-being.
ms bonney: the process that is recommended or may be considered – according to [dr c], is that the parties attend the four-day intensive family therapy program which your honour may be aware that [dr m] goes to the children’s home and spends full days with the parents – at their discretion, but the father, the mother and the two children in the home. it’s a very intensive and [involves] some sense unpacking of the position of where everybody is in that therapy. in my submission, that therapy would only work if (a), the parties could both ... afford it. if they can’t afford it, i think it’s really a moot issue – and i will address you about that shortly, and (b), if there’s genuine intention on the part of both the mother and the father and [child 2] and [child 1] to make the therapy work. ... ms bonney: by way of background, this is the third set of proceedings. the parties separated in september 2009, as you heard from [mr r]. the father commenced the first proceedings in 2011, and they were settled by consent with final orders in 2012. at that time, the children were interviewed by [dr k] in 2012. the second round of proceedings started in 2016, which the mother commenced. that again was settled by consent, and final orders were made in 2017. during that set of proceedings, the children were interviewed by [ms s] in 2016. ... ms bonney: so i raise that just from my inquiries to, i suppose, elucidate to the court that these parents have practical issues in relation to attending [dr m], as much as the mother may want it, and as much as she may think that that’s the answer to unpacking something that – a dish that has been a long time cooking. it has been going for 11 years.
his honour: and if there was the capacity to pay, the issue would then be balancing the children’s wishes and the trauma or even harm to them of forcing them to participate in therapy that they don’t want to participate [in], against the long-term impact on their mental health that’s referred to by [dr c], of having such a negative or stuck in the past view of one of their parents, which is part of who they are. but you say that [is] only going to arise if they can afford the therapy.
his honour: thank you for your patience. from a point of view of looking at the whole family, the family is not in a good place. at the moment as i sit here, i don’t know what the answer is. i will think about it. i don’t know if i have the answer. i don’t have a magic wand. i’m concerned about the short-term psychological welfare of these children, and i’m concerned about the long-term psychological welfare of these adults, that there will be some – or that there already are, in many ways. thank you for your assistance to me today. thank you, everybody. you’re excused.
