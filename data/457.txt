we advise the parties have reached agreement to resolve the dispute as between themselves on a final basis. we now attach the orders signed by both the applicant and respondent reflecting that agreement which the parties seek to be made in chambers. the parties seek this order to be made by way of final order. the orders provide for the respondent to transfer to the applicant her interest in the [b street, suburb c] property to which she concedes she made no contribution towards. the orders also provide for the applicant to retain the whole of the funds in the real estate trust account which are the rental proceeds from the [b street, suburb c] property. each of the parties’ solicitors submit the orders are just and equitable.
...seeking reinstatement of substantive matrimonial funds from the joinder of [the second respondent], which is still pressed by the husband and therefore supposedly should remain an active and outstanding issue to be determined [...] we note following the consent order this matter has been taken off the active list of cases. we are under the impression that he joinder aspect of this matter might have been inadvertently overlooked, and we seek to reinstate it to be active as between [the second respondent]and our client ...
all extant applications between the husband and wife be otherwise dismissed noting that the issue of joinder of the second respondent and whether property orders should be made as between the applicant and the second respondent remains outstanding. [...] b. the matter remains listed for interim hearing on 27 april 2022 at 11am. c. [...] the matter has been restored to the active cases list. this matter was finalised following joint correspondence from the parties on 24 november 2021 indicating the matter has been settled between the parties on a final basis and it was unclear to the court that the applicant was pressing orders against a third party yet to be joined to the proceedings.”
... despite the lack of disclosure from the wife, at the encouragement of the court as noted in notation a of the orders dated 3 november 2021, i formally consented to a final order with the wife on 26 november 2021 after discussing with my lawyer. my consent was given in light of the impending interim determination as for the joiner [sic] issue concerning the second respondent.
joinder application  does the operation of s 106b of the act, as against a third person, survive or persist after the substantive proceedings pursuant to s 79 between the spouse parties have concluded? (b) does the answer to (a) change where the third person was not a party to the proceedings at the time the s 79 proceedings were finalised? (c) if s 106b does survive the making of final orders, is the husband for any other reason precluded from seeking relief against the third person, for example, does an estoppel arise?   does the answer to (a) change where the third person was not a party to the proceedings at the time the s 79 proceedings were finalised? (c) if s 106b does survive the making of final orders, is the husband for any other reason precluded from seeking relief against the third person, for example, does an estoppel arise?   if s 106b does survive the making of final orders, is the husband for any other reason precluded from seeking relief against the third person, for example, does an estoppel arise?
question (a): does the operation of s 106b of the act, as against a third person, survive or persist after the substantive proceedings pursuant to s 79 between the spouse parties have concluded?  if the proceedings were those under s 79, then the relief sought under s 106b could be “carved out”, and (b) if the proceedings were those constituted under s 106b itself, such proceedings could stand alone because “they are proceedings under this act”.   if the proceedings were those constituted under s 106b itself, such proceedings could stand alone because “they are proceedings under this act”.
were orders 4 and 5 of the husband’s final relief carved out of the consent orders?
can section 106b operate as a stand-alone power, after the making of final orders under section 79?  in proceedings under this act, the court may set aside or restrain the making of an instrument or making of a disposition by or on behalf of, or by direction or in the interest of, a party, which is made or proposed to be made to defeat an existing or anticipated order in those proceedings or which, irrespective of intention, is likely to defeat any such order.  .]   the court may order that any money or real or personal property dealt with by any instrument or disposition referred to in subsection (1) [...] may be taken in execution or charged with the payment of such sums for costs or maintenance as the court directs, or that the proceeds of sale must be paid into court to abide its order. (3) the court must have regard to the interests of, and shall make any order proper for the protection of, a bona fide purchaser or other interested person. (4) a party or a person acting in collusion with a party may be ordered to pay the costs of any other party or of a bona fide purchaser or other person interested of and incidental to any such instrument or disposition and the setting aside or restraining of the instrument or disposition.   the court must have regard to the interests of, and shall make any order proper for the protection of, a bona fide purchaser or other interested person. (4) a party or a person acting in collusion with a party may be ordered to pay the costs of any other party or of a bona fide purchaser or other person interested of and incidental to any such instrument or disposition and the setting aside or restraining of the instrument or disposition.   a party or a person acting in collusion with a party may be ordered to pay the costs of any other party or of a bona fide purchaser or other person interested of and incidental to any such instrument or disposition and the setting aside or restraining of the instrument or disposition.
in proceedings under this part, the court may set aside or restrain the making of an instrument or making of a disposition by or on behalf of, or by direction or in the interest of, a party, which is made or proposed to be made to defeat an existing or anticipated order in those proceedings for costs, maintenance or the declaration or alteration of any interests in property or which, irrespective of intention, is likely to defeat any such order. (underlining added)
it is clear that there must be in existence proceedings under part viii of the act before section 85 [the precursor to section 106b] can come into operation: in the marriage of page (1979) 4 fam lr 663 at 666 followed by pawley j in the marriage of rickie [1979] famca 18, (1979) 4 fam lr 737, 24 alr 507. it is obvious that such proceedings must be under part viii, other than proceedings under section 85, otherwise the introductory qualification “in proceedings under this part” become meaningless.
for, as i have indicated earlier, proceedings under section 85 cannot stand by themselves and must be ancillary to the proceedings on foot or completed under pt viii of the act.
the authorities interpreting section 85 merely continue, and apply, the principles to which i have adverted, although each is the decision of a single judge, and thus of merely persuasive authority, their ratio is strong and clear, namely that an offending transaction may anticipate proceedings and orders, but it cannot be set aside under s 85 unless there are on foot proceedings seeking orders which the transaction anticipated, and was designed to defeat [...]. the relevant wording of section 85(1) is not difficult to interpret. the words “in proceedings under this part”, when coupled with the words “in these [sic] proceedings” (the language of the section was “those”), in my view admit no other interpretation than that it is a pre-requisite to the exercise of the power contained in s 85(1) there must be in existence, at the time the application to exercise that power is made, an application which the offending transaction is designed to defeat.
...the disposition must be shown to have the direct effect, or the likely direct effect of defeating an existing ... order in the sense that if the disposition had not taken place the order would have been effective. hence, if an order was, or would in any event have been, defeated by other supervening circumstances, it cannot be said that the order was defeated by the disposition or was at any time likely to have been defeated by it.
...an applicant ... may establish [the s 106b claim] by demonstrating that the pool of property of the parties has been diminished by the making of an instrument or disposition in question to an extent that is likely to have an impact on the anticipated orders.
question (b): does the answer to (a) change where the third person was not a party to the proceedings at the time the s 79 proceedings were finalised?
question (c): if s 106 does survive the making of final orders, is the husband for any other reason precluded from seeking relief against the third person, for example, does an estoppel arise?
conclusion
costs application
does the court have jurisdiction to make a costs order between the husband and wife?
in proceedings under this part, other than proceedings under section 78 or proceedings with respect to maintenance payable during the subsistence of a marriage, the court shall, as far as practicable, make such orders as will finally determine the financial relationships between the parties to the marriage and avoid further proceedings.
are there circumstances that justify the making of a costs order?
“if, in a proceeding under the act, the court is of the opinion that there are circumstances that justify it in doing so, the court may, subject to subsections (2a)[...] and the applicable rules of court, make such order as to costs [...] as the court considers just.”   for the purpose of s 117(2a)(f), she made offers of settlement to the husband in terms that were the same as the consent orders on 21 january 2021 (prior to the first return date), 1 april 2021 and 16 july 2021, and (b) for the purpose of s 117(2a)(a), the husband is in a superior financial position to her, as demonstrated by the financial statements filed by each of the parties (and relied on in the proceedings before me), and the effect of the consent orders. comparing the financial statements relied on by the parties at the hearing before me and the effect of the consent orders: (i) the husband will retain about $3,031,532 in assets and no liabilities. he says his only income is $2,100 from the rent at b street, suburb c and that he has $143 of expenses per week, and (ii) the wife will retain assets valued at about $854,059 in assets (using part i of her financial statement and deducting items 36 and 43, which were transferred to the husband under the consent orders), $55,859 in superannuation and about $817,077 in liabilities.   for the purpose of s 117(2a)(a), the husband is in a superior financial position to her, as demonstrated by the financial statements filed by each of the parties (and relied on in the proceedings before me), and the effect of the consent orders. comparing the financial statements relied on by the parties at the hearing before me and the effect of the consent orders: (i) the husband will retain about $3,031,532 in assets and no liabilities. he says his only income is $2,100 from the rent at b street, suburb c and that he has $143 of expenses per week, and (ii) the wife will retain assets valued at about $854,059 in assets (using part i of her financial statement and deducting items 36 and 43, which were transferred to the husband under the consent orders), $55,859 in superannuation and about $817,077 in liabilities.   the husband will retain about $3,031,532 in assets and no liabilities. he says his only income is $2,100 from the rent at b street, suburb c and that he has $143 of expenses per week, and (ii) the wife will retain assets valued at about $854,059 in assets (using part i of her financial statement and deducting items 36 and 43, which were transferred to the husband under the consent orders), $55,859 in superannuation and about $817,077 in liabilities.  ) the wife will retain assets valued at about $854,059 in assets (using part i of her financial statement and deducting items 36 and 43, which were transferred to the husband under the consent orders), $55,859 in superannuation and about $817,077 in liabilities.
if it appears that both parties have acted reasonably in commencing and defending the proceedings and the conduct of the parties continued to be reasonable until the litigation was settled or its further prosecution became futile, the proper exercise of the costs discretion will usually mean that the court will make no order as to costs in the proceedings. this approach has been adopted in a large number of cases.
