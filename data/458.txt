relevant law
a) the residence parent must actively encourage the chid to attend contact as ordered. b) ‘the courts have been careful to consider whether in reality, not just on the face of things, the [residence] person has taken reasonable steps to deliver the child for [contact]’: see o'brien & o’brien [1992] famca 52, (1993) flc 92-396 at [13]. c) ‘it is not open to the custodial parent to do no more than bring the child to the front entrance and invite it to walk of its own accord to the access parent at the garden gate, and to argue that if the child refuses, all her obligations are satisfied by merely standing, as i put it, with folded arms behind the child, doing nothing either to encourage the child to walk to the father or to discourage the child from remaining on the doorstep and, indeed, this situation is directly comparable to it’: stevenson v hughes [1993] famca 14, (1993) flc 92-363 ([1993] famca unrep527) at [25]. d) similarly, a mere request that the child telephone, or come to the telephone is insufficient. e) once an order for contact has been made, it is ‘no longer a case of saying to the child: you go if you want to, if you wish to go you go, or you make up your own mind’: see o'brien & o’brien [1992] famca 52, (1993) flc 92-396 at [11]. f) a residence parent ought to make ‘the child understand that it was the [residence parent’s] attitude that the child had to go on [contact]’: see o'brien & o’brien [1992] famca 52, (1993) flc 92-396 at [8]. g) the residence parent is expected to bring to bear all the authority that they have over a child, just as they would to ensure the child attends school: see p & p [2002] fmcafam 315 (unrep.) at [14]. h) it must be noted that ‘an invitation can be made designed to persuade the child that this is something which the mother encourages or approves of, or it can be stated in a tone or in a manner which of its own suggests that this is your obligation under the order but mummy really does not mind if you say no.’ such an invitation is insufficient: see stevenson v hughes [1993] famca 14, (1993) flc 92-363 ([1993] famca unrep527) at [26].
