e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   in relation to any views expressed by the child, x said she loves both parents. she said to the child expert that she would be worried about her mother’s response if she said she wanted to live with her father. this may indicate a preference for living with her father. however, i am satisfied that x’s remarks to the child expert indicate a clear preference to live near her father and extended family in town c. (b) in relation to the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and any other persons, including a grandparent or other relative of the child, the child is in the primary care of the mother and spends time with the father. the child has developed a close relationship with her father despite what appears to have been limited time with him. she has a close relationship with the maternal grandparents, particularly the maternal grandmother, and the paternal grandmother and her partner. each of the child’s grandparents are genuinely concerned for her welfare and will support, in particular, the father should x live with him. (c) in relation to the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, to spend time and to communicate with the child, both parents seek to participate in making decisions about the child. the mother by her unilateral relocation interfered with the father’s ability to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, particularly education. despite this, the father has conscientiously endeavoured to spend time with and communicate with the child. (ca) in relation to the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligation to maintain the child, this was not the subject of evidence. the father is dependent on a disability pension and his capacity to maintain the child is limited. (d) in relation to the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent) with whom the child has been living, there was little or no evidence about x’s relationship with her four-year-old half-sister. it is undoubtedly a significant relationship. if the mother decides to return to town c/town d that relationship will continue unchanged. currently, with x living with her mother in city f, her relationship with her grandparents is negatively affected. i am satisfied these are important relationships for x which will not be promoted by the mother. there was no evidence about x’s relationship with mr e’s daughter, h. (e) in relation to the practical difficulty and expense of the child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, the mother’s proposal will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with his father. (f) in relation to the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs, i am not satisfied that the mother is adequately able to provide for the needs of the child. her unilateral relocation and deliberate breach of a court order indicate a lack of insight into the child’s needs. the father, although not the primary carer of the child, impressed the child expert as child focussed. i accept that opinion. there was no suggestion that he was unable to care for the child on a day-to-day basis. i am satisfied the grandparents are able to provide for the child’s needs and will assist the father while he resides on town c. there was no suggestion he intends to live elsewhere. (g) in relation to the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background of the child and of either of the child’s parents, there are no relevant matters. (h) in relation to if the child is an aboriginal or torres strait islander child, the child is not an aboriginal or torres strait islander child. (i) in relation to the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents, see (e) above. (j) in relation to any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family, this matter is discussed above. i am satisfied that the child has been exposed to family violence. while i have not found that the child was hit with an implement or punched by the mother i consider that other matters fall within the definition of family violence. the mother’s unilateral relocation has prevented the child from keeping connections with her family. mr e’s violent self-harm also constituted family violence. (k) family violence orders are not applicable to the parties in this case. (l) in relation to whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child, the court will attempt to make such an order. (m) in relation to any other relevant fact or circumstance, there are no other relevant facts or circumstances.   in relation to the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and any other persons, including a grandparent or other relative of the child, the child is in the primary care of the mother and spends time with the father. the child has developed a close relationship with her father despite what appears to have been limited time with him. she has a close relationship with the maternal grandparents, particularly the maternal grandmother, and the paternal grandmother and her partner. each of the child’s grandparents are genuinely concerned for her welfare and will support, in particular, the father should x live with him.
