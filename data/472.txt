conduct of the hearing
relevant legal principles
legislation  a person who publishes in a newspaper or periodical publication, by radio broadcast or television or by other electronic means, or otherwise disseminates to the public or to a section of the public by any means, any account of any proceedings, or of any part of any proceedings, under this act that identifies: (a) a party to the proceedings, (b) a person who is related to, or associated with, a party to the proceedings or is, or is alleged to be, in any other way concerned in the matter to which the proceedings relate, or (c) a witness in the proceedings,   a party to the proceedings, (b) a person who is related to, or associated with, a party to the proceedings or is, or is alleged to be, in any other way concerned in the matter to which the proceedings relate, or (c) a witness in the proceedings,   a person who is related to, or associated with, a party to the proceedings or is, or is alleged to be, in any other way concerned in the matter to which the proceedings relate, or (c) a witness in the proceedings,   a witness in the proceedings,
commits an offence punishable, upon conviction by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one year.   the preceding provisions of this section do not apply to or in relation to: (a) the communication, to persons concerned in proceedings in any court, of any pleading, transcript of evidence or other document for use in connection with those proceedings,   the communication, to persons concerned in proceedings in any court, of any pleading, transcript of evidence or other document for use in connection with those proceedings,  .]   the communication of any pleading, transcript of evidence or other document to: (i) a body that is responsible for disciplining members of the legal profession in a state or territory, or (ii) persons concerned in disciplinary proceedings against a member of the legal profession of a state or territory, being proceedings before a body that is responsible for disciplining members of the legal profession in that state or territory, or   a body that is responsible for disciplining members of the legal profession in a state or territory, or (ii) persons concerned in disciplinary proceedings against a member of the legal profession of a state or territory, being proceedings before a body that is responsible for disciplining members of the legal profession in that state or territory, or  ) persons concerned in disciplinary proceedings against a member of the legal profession of a state or territory, being proceedings before a body that is responsible for disciplining members of the legal profession in that state or territory, or
the harman undertaking
where one party to litigation is compelled, either by reason of a rule of the court, by reason of a specific order of the court, or otherwise, to disclose documents or information, the party obtaining the disclosure cannot, without leave of the court, use it for any purpose other than that for which it was given unless it is received into evidence.[15]
in order to be released from the implied undertaking it has been said that a party [...] must show “special circumstances” [...] [t]he notion of “special circumstances” does not require that some extraordinary factors must bear on the question before the discretion will be exercised. it is sufficient to say that, in all the circumstances, good reason must be shown why, contrary to the usual position, documents produced or information obtained in one piece of litigation should be used for the advantage of a party in another piece of litigation or for another non-litigious purpose. the discretion is a broad one and all the circumstances of the case must be examined.[17]   the nature of the document, (b) the circumstances under which the document came into existence, (c) the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain, (d) whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain, (e) the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), (f) the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant, and (g) the likely contribution of the document achieving justice in the other proceeding.   the circumstances under which the document came into existence, (c) the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain, (d) whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain, (e) the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), (f) the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant, and (g) the likely contribution of the document achieving justice in the other proceeding.   the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain, (d) whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain, (e) the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), (f) the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant, and (g) the likely contribution of the document achieving justice in the other proceeding.   whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain, (e) the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), (f) the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant, and (g) the likely contribution of the document achieving justice in the other proceeding.   the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), (f) the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant, and (g) the likely contribution of the document achieving justice in the other proceeding.   the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant, and (g) the likely contribution of the document achieving justice in the other proceeding.   the likely contribution of the document achieving justice in the other proceeding.   any injustice caused to the husband, and (b) whether the wife ought to be relieved from the harman undertaking because some “special circumstance” exists.   whether the wife ought to be relieved from the harman undertaking because some “special circumstance” exists.
as regards the submissions based on the prohibition against publication of proceedings contained in sec. 121 of the act, we consider that the transmission of documents to the attorney general or to responsible officers in his department is not “publishing” or “publication” “to the public or a section of the public” within the meaning of sec. 121 of the family law act, and that this section does not inhibit a judge’s discretion to refer papers to the attorney general.
counsel for the deputy commissioner submitted, in my view correctly, that in the context of s.121 “disseminates to the public” should be taken as a reference to widespread communication with the aim of reaching a wide audience.[18]
