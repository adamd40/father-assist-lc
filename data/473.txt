reasons for judgment(ex tempore reasons settled from transcript)
judge dickson:
introduction
brief background
respondent’s application for summary dismissal
duplicity of pleaded breaches
breach 15 order breached order 22(a) date of alleged contravention 07/10/2021 3:00pm place k street, suburb l statement of the alleged contravention from around 3:00pm 21 october 2021 to around 1.00pm 23 october 2021 ms devine prevented me from spending time with b. (see paragraphs 85 of the applicant's affidavit).  ince the proceedings [for civil contempt] are of a quasi-criminal nature, [the person charged] is entitled to the classic protections of an accused in a criminal trial. one of those protections i have already noted, he must be heard on his own behalf if he so desires. there are others. he must be informed with reasonable particularity of the matters alleged against him. he must have the right to cross-examine witnesses called against him and to call witnesses in his own case. he is entitled to be legally represented. he commences with the presumption of innocence which he does not lose until the case against him is proved beyond reasonable doubt. (see: halsbury 4th edition volume 9 p 36 and re bramblevale (1970) ch 128).[2]
evaluation of summary dismissal application
a party may apply for summary orders after a response has been filed if the party claims, in relation to the application or response, that: ... after a response has been filed, if the party claims in relation to the application or response that: (a) the court has no jurisdiction, or (b) the other party has no legal capacity to apply for the orders sought, or (c) it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process, or (d) there is no reasonable likelihood of success.
there was no dispute before me that the court has power to dismiss an application that it finds to be an abuse of process. the existence of an implied power to do so was acknowledged by the full court of this court in tansell and tansell (1977) flc 90-307, at page 76,625: it has been held that there is an inherent power in every court to stay or dismiss actions which are frivolous or vexatious or an abuse of the process of the court. (norman v mathews (1916) 85 ljkb 857 (at p 859), per lush j and 861 per sankey j.:metropolitan bank v pooley (1885) 10 app cas 210, 214). the clearest expression of intention to the contrary would be required before it could be held that the family court of australia did not have this inherent power to stay or dismiss frivolous, vexatious or abusive proceedings.[4]
this court has power to make orders that prevent an abuse of its process and protect its own functions (see williams v spautz [1992] hca 34, (1992) 174 clr 509 at 518). what amounts to an abuse of court process is insusceptible of a formulation comprising closed categories (see batistatos v roads & traffic authority (nsw) [2006] hca 27, (2006) 226 clr 256 at 265), however, one established category is where the use of the court’s procedures would bring the administration of justice into disrepute (see batistatos at 267, rogers v the queen [1994] hca 42, (1994) 181 clr 251 at 286). the abuse of the court’s process may be apparent, not just from the institution or prosecution of the proceedings, but from procedural steps taken in the litigation, in which case the power to deal with the procedural abuse extends to the exclusion of the particular vexatious issue from the litigation (see batistatos at 267).[7]
