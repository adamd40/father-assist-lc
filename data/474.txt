placing the contraventions in context
turning to that second affidavit and the text messages, there is a concerning pattern in those messages of the mother communicating with [z] whilst she is in the father’s care and what is of most concern is the content of those messages. i am not going to recite all of them, but what they indicate is a concerning pattern of the mother encouraging [z] to play up for her father and ask to go home. what is really concerning is that there is a consistent pattern of these types of messages for the past several months. early examples include the mother telling her not to show the father that it is her on the phone and that she should start coughing and saying that she feels sick and wants her own bed. [z] reported that she said that to her father and that her father had said that he was there for her and the mother saying that she should say “i just want my bed. it’s not that hard to say” and [z] replying that she would try and then further replying that the father said he would look after her. there are other messages where the mother asks her to delete the messages from the phone. there is a message where [z] reports to her mother that the father told her that he would take away the phone and next time no phones would be allowed and so she told him that she would call the police. the mother replies – and this is in july 2018 – that the orders do not say that she cannot have a phone, so she should let him try. and what is concerning about these early messages is that quite apart from the fact that it appears to be in breach of order 5 of the orders made on 3 july 2018 – and the important point there is that it is about the mother initiating the communications with the children – but it is the attempts by the mother to undermine the children’s relationship with their father and also involving [z] in the dispute and quite plainly telling her that the orders do not say that she cannot have a phone, for example. there are messages in september where [z] has asked her mother to pick her up, the mother saying that she will come and get her and also telling [z] to make sure she deletes the messages from both phones. concerningly, a message that just says: make sure you tell them everything. swearing, yelling, finger in your face. everything. and then saying:
delete messages from me.
there are then texts which appear to be the mother encouraging [z] to message her father, saying that their mother asks every day if they want to call him, but that they are still angry with him and that they do not want to, and this is in march 2018. then there is a message where [z] says:
don’t even try to text or ring me.
she calls her father a “shit father” and complains about the father keeping her phone and asks about her goosebumps books and makes other complaints about him and refers to him as “[mr zane]” and not “dad”. the mother refers to the text messages in her affidavit of 6 may and 20 may and says that where she was quoted as saying “it’s not that hard to say and speak calmly,” for example, she was just encouraging [z] to express her feelings to her father. the mother annexes to her affidavit a handwritten note from [x] complaining about her father and says that she found that note in [x]’s bag, written on the father’s work letterhead. she says that the messages sent in september were trying to reassure [z] after there had been several incidents whilst in the father’s care. the mother also says that the father has shown damaging messages, but not messages of no substance. she also says that the father has known about the communication between them all throughout and in this regard, exhibit b, which the mother relied on, is a letter from her lawyers to the father’s dated 13 march 2019, which the mother says supports her contention that the parties have been communicating freely for the past six months. that letter says that:
the mother’s instructions are that the parties have enjoyed a successful co-parenting arrangement for six months and that both are working well together for the benefit of the children.
it seeks to discharge order 5 of the orders made on 3 july 2018, noting that the children have been communicating with the mother during their time with the father with the father’s consent. i observe that, certainly, the parties’ affidavits and the text messages do not indicate a cooperative co-parenting relationship. that letter contains the assertion from the mother that they are cooperating and the father consents to her communication with the children, but does not indicate that the father agrees with that proposition.
alleged contraventions
mother contacts x
save as explicitly provided for in these orders, the mother, her servants and/or agents be and are hereby restrained from spending time with or communicating or attempting to communicate with [z] and [x] or either of them by any means, including but not limited to telephone, text message, email, via social media, via “applications”, online forums and the like.
for and by way of clarification of order 7 herein, the servants and agents of the mother include the mother’s friends and their family members.
now that the final orders are done, i am asking you again for [y] to stay with me in reality. her schoolwork has already gone downhill in the last eight days.
mother contacts z
mother contacts x and z
mother responds and fails to notify father regarding unauthorised contact
in the event that [z] and [x] or either of them contact and/or communicate with the mother by any means save as explicitly provided for in these orders, the mother shall immediately report same to the father and be and is hereby restrained from responding to such contact and/or communication.
mother’s agent contacts children
mother’s agent contacts school
in relation to communication between the mother and [z] and [x]’s school/s, the following shall apply: the mother shall be at liberty to contact the school/s by email to obtain updates in relation to [z] and [x]’s progress, and the father shall authorise the school/s to respond to the mother with such information on each occasion, and save for the contact permitted under subparagraph (a) herein, the mother, her servants and agents be and are hereby restrained from contacting or attending [z] and [x]’s school/s and from attending any extra-curricular activities, sporting events, concerts or the like, unless invited to attend by the father in accordance with order 16(b) herein.
hi [mr e], i have an urgent request if possible please...its from [z]’s mother..she needs in writing best to your knowledge that [z] was living with her mother in 2020... are you able to do this. im happy to collect the letter. thank you. [ms b]”
the message the ms b sent to the principal on 18 february 2021 is clearly sent at the mother’s request. ms b conceded that. however that is not the subject of one of the contraventions betting pursued. i am not satisfied that count 1 has been established. in order to be successful it is not enough to establish that ms b contacted the school, which is not disputed, the father must establish that ms b did so as the mother’s agent. both the mother and ms b denied this. whilst i have considerable reservations about the mother’s veracity i am not satisfied that this court has been made out. i dismiss count 1.
mother fails to immediately return children to father’s care ) in the event that z and x or either of them attend upon the mother at her home or any other location save as explicitly provided for in these orders, the mother shall return z and/or x immediately to the father.
