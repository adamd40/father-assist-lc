exercised in making findings in interim parenting proceedings. their honours said:
[88] in our view, findings made at an interim hearing should be couched with great circumspection, no matter how firmly a judge’s intuition may suggest that the finding will be borne out after a full testing of the evidence. 3] later, at [100] their honours amplified their comments and said:
[100] the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.

i'm not the computer man. my accounts have all been hacked. everyone. there's no proof i sent anything. regardless of whose email and phone number. do you know how easy it is to hide that or pretend to mimic someone number. apparently very very easy according to the it experts. iv[e] made inquiries. put it this way. my passwords are not far2easy anymore like it used to be. i only just changed them last week. b) i would really like to have a talk. i really would. we need to desperately [the mother]. it can't go on. also why have you filed for an ivo?
