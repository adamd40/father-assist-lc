with all of the above issues and considerations in mind, it is the view of this writer that the mother’s proposal, or something akin to this, may be most consistent with the children’s needs. this view gives consideration to some of the mother’s reported concerns in relation to the father, some of which appear supported by independent material as discussed in this report, and some of the perceived medium and longer term benefits for the children. some of the likely benefits of the mother’s proposal for the children to live primarily with her and to slightly reduce the children’s time living with the father during the school term follows: (a) slightly reducing the opportunity of exposing the children to any harm relating to any future escalations in the father’s alcohol use or deteriorations of his mental health, (b) continuing to provide the children with quality time with the father and their important relationships in his household through regular school term time and significant and substantial school holiday time, thus providing the children with an ongoing opportunity to create positive memories with the father, ms f and the step-siblings, (c) the promotion of greater stability and routine for the children during a greater proportion of their school weeks, including reducing the need for earlier starts and greater travel to/from school from the father’s residence (which also takes away some of this burden from the father and ms f), (d) reducing opportunities for the children to attend school unnecessarily late (which appears to have occurred at times when living with the father), and (e) increasing opportunities for the children to more regularly attend their various midweek extracurricular activities (which the mother appears to more actively facilitate and promote). there are some possible cons to the mother’s proposal which need to be acknowledged, these being: (a) the children needing to adjust to a different living arrangement after 4 years living in the current arrangement (noting that they would likely be able to adjust with appropriate support from the parents and the step-parents), (b) the children spending less time with the step-siblings with whom they appear to have a significant relationship, (c) the children obviously spending less time with the father and ms f who are both important people to the children, and (d) that it goes against the stated views of at least one of the children. giving consideration to the pros and cons of the mother’s proposal, and keeping in mind the children’s significant relationships with both parents and members of both parents’ households, it is the view of this writer that the benefits would outweigh and potentially neutralise any perceived cons, and that the children may ultimately benefit in the long term from a slight adjustment to the current arrangement.   slightly reducing the opportunity of exposing the children to any harm relating to any future escalations in the father’s alcohol use or deteriorations of his mental health, (b) continuing to provide the children with quality time with the father and their important relationships in his household through

...they (the children) simply can’t make sense of your actions and need help through this time of potential upheaval.[22]
...perhaps it’s time you reconsidered your obsessions with trying to minimise our time with them, i fear that it’s based on your jealousy of how happy they are whilst in our care and of the amazing relationship that they have with their sisters and step-mother. the girls have mentioned that they are unable to talk to you about anything because you yell and scream at them, this aligns with my experience of you as well. i worry about the long term impact that will have on their relationship with you...
...they are children, i do not want them treated like a punching bag for your connellys panics, you used to call them when trying to justify your behaviour toward me. i am writing the following paragraphs as a co-parent who doesn’t want to embarrass you, but whose hands are tied. originally, i tried to keep your past actions regarding drug and alcohol use, promiscuouty (sic) and violence out of the conversation. the burrito thrown, the punches in suburb ak and the incessant emotional abuse has been sparsely documented but i will have to fix that now. why i did this i’m unsure, as your lies towards me lacked the same compassion.
the y profile - love heart emoji y - hi, mum is going good. no yelling the y profile - that’s good.
the y profile – hey ys ipad a missed call from you at 9:30 last night. is everything ok? y – i didn call i don’t think the y profile – it says there is a missed video chat from y just above the picture you sent y – mum might of bumped my ipad last night the y profile – cute picture. did you just change it? y - yes the y profile – i hope you have a good day. i was worried that you were feeling unsafe there again. y – i never feel unsafe. y – where (sic) having a play date with our friend n the y profile – that what x said, i thought that you both said it. that good then. y – no that ok y – love you y – i have a birthday party in three weeks at location o the y profile – do you remember that’s what x said to me? y – no not really the y profile – what do you remember her saying? y – the party starts at 11 am to 9 30 pm y – never fell unsafe y - i excited for the party

conclusion – parenting proceedings  i have not found that her household poses any risk of harm to the children, (b) her capacity to support the children’s meaningful relationship with the father was not impinged by the same condescending and hurtful expressions displayed by the father towards her, (c) my confidence that whilst the children have expressed views different to my orders (which were given limited weight by me as previously explained), with the support of the mother, mr e and any outside psychological assistance the mother may seek, the children will be able to adjust to the change in their circumstances and continue to maintain strong and loving relationships with the father and members of his household including aj.   her capacity to support the children’s meaningful relationship with the father was not impinged by the same condescending and hurtful expressions displayed by the father towards her, (c) my confidence that whilst the children have expressed views different to my orders (which were given limited weight by me as previously explained), with the support of the mother, mr e and any outside psychological assistance the mother may seek, the children will be able to adjust to the change in their circumstances and continue to maintain strong and loving relationships with the father and members of his household including aj.   my confidence that whilst the children have expressed views different to my orders (which were given limited weight by me as previously explained), with the support of the mother, mr e and any outside psychological assistance the mother may seek, the children will be able to adjust to the change in their circumstances and continue to maintain strong and loving relationships with the father and members of his household including aj.   my previous finding that the father poses a risk of harm to the children in being unable to meet their emotional needs. (b) the father’s poor attitude towards the children and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by a pattern of disregard for their emotional needs not evident from the mother’s more recent transgression in june 2022 (when she asked y for her views following the ipad incident). by way of some examples only, i note – his refusal to accept the need for y to use a laxative until he heard it from the doctor (which meant that she experienced adverse symptoms when she returned to her mother’s home after a week at the father’s home), his refusal to accept dental advice (via the mother but coming from the children’s dentist), the children being adversely affected by his inability to co-operate with the mother to resolve the school library issue but rather to solely seek to blame her, in circumstances where it was apparent that to try and resolve some of the issues she had paid fines for library books apparently lost at his home, the children not being able to have regularised professional swimming lessons each week despite the mother being willing to negotiate with him, his overwhelmingly toxic view of the mother as a parent which included her being neurotic, having a past coloured by unsubstantiated allegations of drug and alcohol abuse and promiscuity, and that she was the one who should go to a private health retreat because she needed help, and his behaviour towards the mother (and her counsel) during the trial which was condescending, dismissive and/or at times, inappropriately argumentative and interventionist. (c) despite the orders not being in line with their reported views (to which i have given limited weight), the children will be able to adjust to the change in circumstances with the support of the adults in their lives (and other professionals as may be required). they will continue to have a meaningful relationship with the father in circumstances where there is no doubt that they already have a strong and loving relationship with him but the risk of harm posed by him needs to be ameliorated by a reduction in overall time spent in his presence including the complete removal of time during the school week so that the children’s exposure to parental conflict is significantly reduced and their routines can be regularised so that, for example they no longer risk feeling distressed or left out because their parents simply cannot co-operate on the simplest of schooling issues such as happened with the school library, (d) the children’s strong and loving relationships with ms f, aj and other members of the father’s household and his extended family will endure given the regular time and communication the children will continue to have with the father (and members of his household) on a background of the children already having strong and loving relationships with them.   the father’s poor attitude towards the children and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by a pattern of disregard for their emotional needs not evident from the mother’s more recent transgression in june 2022 (when she asked y for her views following the ipad incident). by way of some examples only, i note – his refusal to accept the need for y to use a laxative until he heard it from the doctor (which meant that she experienced adverse symptoms when she returned to her mother’s home after a week at the father’s home), his refusal to accept dental advice (via the mother but coming from the children’s dentist), the children being adversely affected by his inability to co-operate with the mother to resolve the school library issue but rather to solely seek to blame her, in circumstances where it was apparent that to try and resolve some of the issues she had paid fines for library books apparently lost at his home, the children not being able to have regularised professional swimming lessons each week despite the mother being willing to negotiate with him, his overwhelmingly toxic view of the mother as a parent which included her being neurotic, having a past coloured by unsubstantiated allegations of drug and alcohol abuse and promiscuity, and that she was the one who should go to a private health retreat because she needed help, and his behaviour towards the mother (and her counsel) during the trial which was condescending, dismissive and/or at times, inappropriately argumentative and interventionist.
