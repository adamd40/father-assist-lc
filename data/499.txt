...protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.
the primary considerations  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  ] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) – something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act – the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent.
meaningful relationship
...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...  2] ...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
family violence   an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or ... (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture...
such behaviour must still meet the definition as contained within s 4ab(1).
123. coerce is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as to restrain or constrain by force, law or authority, force or compel, as to do something. 2. to compel by forcible action control is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as: to exercise restraint or direction over, dominate, command the phrase “coerces or controls” is expressed disjunctively. however it may be seen that the two concepts are closely related. together they form an expanded concept of the exercise of power, to restrain another or to cause another to act, by force, domination or command...  ] ...to the extent that it is submitted that the mother’s allegations of “horrific domestic violence” could only be accepted if objectively corroborated, we do not find that any such requirement exists. where domestic violence occurs in a family it frequently occurs in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage, and possibly their children. we cannot accept that a court could never make a positive finding that such violence occurred without there being corroborative evidence from a third party or a document or an admission. we have not been referred to any authority in support of such a proposition. ... [81] the victims of domestic violence do not have to complain to the authorities or subject themselves to medical examinations, which may provide corroborative evidence of some fact, to have their evidence of assault accepted. clearly if they do so it is evidence which may assist the court in determining an allegation.
fucking stupid bitch and you had said that you would come, you dumb bitch.[17]
he could not answer whether he knew this was abusive or problematic at the time he sent it, as he “didn’t think much of it back then.”[18]
the next time you fuck up, i’m leaving you for a week. i don’t even want you. why would i come back to a whiny little girl who makes me angry non-stop with her shit.
the father agreed that he was telling the mother that it was the mother’s fault and that he would punish her by leaving her for a week.
i’m sick and tired of the way you are just like why everyone else has left you including your friends because they’re sick of you and the way you are and i don’t think you have control over the way you are.[21]
the father conceded that he was belittling and shaming the mother, trying to undermine her self-esteem and her relationships with other people. he admitted that he was trying to make the mother feel responsible for his anger and suggesting to her that she has no one else other than him.
don’t fuck around with something that makes you happy. if someone makes you happy, you should try and make them happy as well. [22]
the father conceded that at that time it was his belief that it was the mother’s job to make him happy.
you’re probably the worst girlfriend anyone would ever ask for. now, fuck off.[23]
the father conceded that this was an attack on the mother’s self-esteem in circumstances where she has issues with her self-esteem.
you’re pure evil and nobody is ever going to love you for the way you are.[24]
the father again conceded that this was an attack on the mother’s self-esteem.
it’s been two weeks. you have till wednesday to contact me, otherwise i’ll be handling this situation with my own hands.[25]
whilst the father now accepts that this message is a threatening message, it did not “cross his mind” at the time that this message would be perceived as threatening by the mother. i accept that the mother would have perceived this message as threatening.

october 2017: alleged sexual assaults
father: just suck it. mother: i can’t open my mouth.[33]  unsel for the father] now, i’ve never – i asked you the question generally but because it comes up in the early stages of the relationship i’m going to ask you a question specifically or put to you that mr hoda in or around the time you allege at the commencement of the relationship or thereabouts mr hoda never raped you? [the mother] what’s the question? did he never - - - [counsel for the father] i’m putting to you that mr hoda never raped you, as you allege? [the mother] he did.[35]
november 2017: bruising on the mother’s arm
january 2018: non-lethal strangulation
february 2018: the car door incident unsel for the mother] well, did she say anything to you about leaving her home or not? [the father] no, i can’t – i can’t recall. sorry, what paragraph is this? [counsel for the mother] no, i’m not taking you to a paragraph. i’m asking whether you can recall this incident, firstly? [the father] mmm. [counsel for the mother] so is your evidence as you sit there today that you can’t recall what she was saying – what it is that she had said to you on that occasion? [the father] i would like to look at the paragraph, please. [counsel for the mother] well, that’s not the way it works, mr hoda? [the father] okay. [counsel for the mother] i’m asking you whether you can recall what she had said to you? [the father] i can’t recall.[39]
2018: x’s birth
father: i can’t believe you told my parents mother: they needed to know the truth. you need to be honest with them about whether you have a problem. father: i’ll walk you outside and then get the fuck out of my house.[50]  unsel for the mother] so even though you had just broken up with her, you told her to get out of your house, you didn’t want to see her, you still had to know who she was talking to, correct? [the father] yes.[62]  unsel for the mother] in the same way that you were unable to control yourself when you became angry in all the other occasions when you were abusive, correct? [the father] yes. [counsel for the mother] so, at that time, even though you had ended the relationship, you literally kicked her out of the house, she should not have been talking to this person, in your mind? [the father] that was in my mind, yes.[63]
progress note addendum. patient and her mother declared that they will not have anything to do with the father of baby where there was some recent history of domestic violence. they also added that the father has also indicated that he does not want anything to do with ms neman or the baby.[64]  unsel for the mother] okay. all right. well, it’s only a couple of – i will read it to you.
november 2019, [ms neman] expressed to me a desire to resume our relationship and be intimate with me again. on one occasion, we were at a park together and [ms neman] said, “i really miss you”. we then started hugging and kissing. i pulled away and said to [ms neman], this is not right. you’re still in a relationship with [mr m].
what i’m asking you is whether or not – is whether her telling you that she really missed you and you beginning to hug and kiss, is that what you mean when you say she “wanted to be intimate with me”, is that what you’re describing? [the father] no. that – it – it could have been but it didn’t suggest that she wanted to be intimate with me, no. [counsel for the mother] all right. well, what are you referring to when you say she wanted to be intimate? “she expressed to me a desire to resume our relationship and be intimate with me again”? [the father] yes. progressing to being intimate. [counsel for the mother] yes. all right. why is it important for her honour to know that she wanted to be intimate with you in november 2019? [the father] it’s suggesting that she wants to get back together and potentially have moved on from previous problems. [counsel for the mother] okay. so you think the fact that she – you believe she wanted to resume your relationship and be intimate with you again was her – she had gotten over the fact that you had assaulted her? [the father] it – it could have been.[65]
july 2018: the passport issue
january 2021
coercive and controlling behaviour
if i ever find out another guy is touching my baby will that ever happen? hello?? you have a problem don’t you? why can’t you reply?[72]   neman], if you’re not selfish or irresponsible, you will have to give your full focus to her. don’t ever tell me again that you’re going clubbing or you’re going out to have fun or tell me bullshit that you’re going to leave her and go to [country ae] for your birthday. we’re not even in a relationship any more and you still haven’t cut the bullshit. if you want to go out and have fun, you take her with you. you take good care of her, you take good care of her, because if i ever find out you’re fucking around i’m going to take full custody of her and you can do nothing about it.[73]
the father admitted that at that time he felt that he was entitled to say that to the mother, and admitted that it was controlling behaviour on his part.
sexual assault by the mother upon the father
verbal abuse
other risk issues
the additional considerations
any views expressed by the children
the nature of x’s relationship with the parents and other significant persons
the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with the child
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent's obligations to maintain the child
the capacity of each parent to provide for x’s needs, including emotional and intellectual needs
...[mr hoda]’s account of [x] seeking comfort from him on the one occasion she spent time with him in the absence of [ms neman] appeared focused on his experiences of this and the benefits to him rather than demonstrating understanding and sensitivity that [x] was likely experiencing discomfort, and seeking reassurance, in circumstances whereby she was separated from her primary carer and being introduced to people she was not familiar with. [mr [[hoda]] choosing to include his friends on that occasion, in addition to his rationale for his proposals, also raises concerns that his motivation for seeking for [x] to spend time with him is in order to meet his own needs.[85]
...[mr hoda]’s apparent focus on [ms neman]’s willingness to facilitate [x] spending time with him, rather than acknowledging the significant contribution of his own choices and actions, raises concerns regarding his insight into the contribution of his own behaviour and his capacity to address concerns regarding [x’s] safety and wellbeing in his care that would support [x] building and maintaining a meaningful relationship with him as being in her best interests...[86]
....due to his perpetration of coercive and controlling family violence against [ms neman]. coercive controlling family violence is associated with parenting deficits for a perpetrating parent that can pose a risk of harm to a child or result in a child’s needs being unmet. these include a perpetrating parent providing low parental warmth, inappropriately using authority and/or coercive discipline methods that can escalate to physical abuse, and/or a limited capacity to separate the child’s needs from the perpetrator’s needs.[87]
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances including the effect of any separation from either of the parents or any other person with whom they have been living
any other relevant fact or circumstance
discussion
assessment of risk
...suffer insecurity, fear, unhappiness, anxiety and hypervigilance from witnessing abusive behaviour of a parent. such effects present a threat to their emotional development. probably the worst danger to children is the role model that a violent parent provides which can lead to children themselves coming to suffer the serious social disability of using violence in their dealings with other people including those they love. such a disability can destroy the most intimate relationships and bring the person into conflict with other people, the police and the law...
these include:
... the risk that the perpetrating parent will undermine the other parent’s role and authority as a parent, which may have a detrimental impact on the child’s relationship with the victim-parent and increased risk of psychological abuse and manipulation of the child by the perpetrating parent, including utilising a child to monitor a victim-parent.[89]  e father] i’ve become more conscious and i understand and identify what those problems were and i’m now able to, you know, control myself. [counsel for the mother] but what has caused you to now understand things that you didn’t understand then? [the father] being conscious. [counsel for the mother] is that your answer? [the father] yes. [counsel for the mother] nothing else? it’s your chance to tell us, [mr hoda]? [the father] being – being conscious and understanding the types of different behaviours – controlling behaviours, violent behaviours. ... [counsel for the mother] yes. and is that because you’ve done a parenting course or two? [the father] i’ve only done one. [counsel for the mother] okay. how long was the course for? this is the internet parenting course up to parents, yes? [the father] yes. it’s very short. [counsel for the mother] well, how long? [the father] it’s two days [counsel for the mother] two full days? [the father] two – yes, around two days maximum. [counsel for the mother] all right. do you remember the topics that were covered in that course? [the father] yes. [counsel for the mother] well, tell us? [the father] it’s about getting along with the other parent and techniques to use, your mindset in regards to parenting, co-parenting. [counsel for the mother] anything else? [the father] how x might feel during these times, and [counsel for the mother] during what times? [the father] during times of breakup and, yes [counsel for the mother] and this course wasn’t a face-to-face course, was it? [the father] no. [counsel for the mother] it was something you got online and you completed, yes? [the father] yes, as suggested. [92]
...is beyond the scope of this assessment and cannot be discounted. if, as [mr hoda] indicated, he perpetrated family violence against [ms neman] due to being emotionally dysregulated to the extent that he was not responsible for his actions, significant concerns would be raised regarding [mr hoda]’s psychological functioning and, therefore, [x’s] safety and wellbeing in his care... [99]
when [mr hoda] was asked what he could do to rebuild trust between him and [ms neman], he stated “we both need to forgive each other for everything that’s happened in the past”. he acknowledged that he was asked about himself and stated that he needs to “forgive [[ms neman]] for everything that’s happened in the past” and referred to “crazy allegations” [ms neman] had made, however, he said “i will move on from it”. [mr hoda] also identified that he and [ms neman] “really need to start communicating and understand each other”, including how they each feel and why they feel the way they do. he stated that he really wants to be civil with [ms neman] in order to “raise [x] together”, “without any problems”, and to be able to “quickly solve” any problems that arise.
and at paragraph 65:
...his narrative indicated that he perceives his abusive behaviour as being beyond his control, and abuse and possessiveness as justified responses to anger and jealousy, rather than acknowledging, and being accountable for, his choice to perpetrate coercion, control, and abuse against [ms neman]. [mr hoda] did also not demonstrate an understanding that his choice to perpetrate family violence is likely to be a consideration in determining whether or not it is in [x’s] best interests to spend time with him.
and at paragraph 66:
...the overall impression was that any insight demonstrated by [mr hoda] regarding his perpetration of family violence, and the impact of this on [ms neman] and [x], was superficial and not indicative of genuine and substantive change that would be consistent with a reduction in risk of harm to [x]. [mr hoda] not taking responsibility for his perpetration of family violence and demonstrating limited impact of his behaviour on [ms neman] and [x] raises concerns regarding his motivation to change in order to protect [x] from the risks associated with contact with a perpetrator of family violence.
...in upholding children's right to protection from sexual, psychological and/or emotional harm, the court must take into account any anxiety on the part of the primary caregiver concerning the child's exposure to potential harm where such anxiety is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s caregiving ability.  ] importantly, the full court in marra held that not only is it necessary for the court to determine whether a parent has a genuine concern about the welfare of the child in the care of the other parent but it is also necessary to determine whether the concerned parent’s parenting capacity will be “discernibly impaired”. ‘discernibly’, or similar expressions that have been used in the relevant authorities to which we have referred, means no more than being an evident or detectable impairment in parenting capacity such that there is an unacceptable risk that the child’s welfare will be adversely impacted.
...the first enquiry is whether there is objectively an unacceptable risk. if there is the court must take steps proportionate to the degree of risk. if there is not, the court may then need to consider whether the residence parent has a genuinely held belief that such a risk exists and whether that will have a significant impact on that party’s capacity as the resident parent and so impinge on the best interests of the children. the court then needs to take steps proportionate to that circumstance... (emphasis added)
please if you love me come back. i don’t want to hurt myself but i’m close.[111]
...is highly likely to be a mitigating factor in her experiencing anxiety associated with her and in her wanting to limit hers and [x’s] contact with him. it is, however, possible that the adverse impact on [ms neman]’s psychological wellbeing is disproportionate to the risk to [x] in [mr hoda]’s care. irrespective, any deterioration in [ms neman]’s psychological functioning could have an adverse impact on [ms neman]’s parenting capacity and ability to meet [x’s] needs and, therefore, pose an associated risk of harm to [x]. additionally, if it is determined that [x] is not at risk of harm in [mr hoda]’s care and she should spend time with him, [x] being aware of, and exposed to, anxiety experienced by [ms neman] regarding her spending time with [mr hoda] is likely to undermine [x]’s ability to build a meaningful relationship with him.[118]
...particularly the possibility that [x] might commence spending time with him, would be “very stressful” for [ms neman] and would trigger her “hypervigilance” and “anxiety” and would “definitely be affecting her.[119]  unsel for the mother] so you say that her honour should be concerned about the mother’s mental health whilst she’s caring for [x], yes? [the father] there should be consideration, yes. [counsel for the mother] yes. and so if it was the case that any contact that you had with [x] led to a deterioration in the mother’s mental health, you would accept that that would not be in [x’s] best interest, correct? [the father] yes.[120]  unsel for the mother] and it means that really her honour couldn’t be satisfied, that, for example, if that was the case, that the paternal grandparents provide some level of mitigation of risk? [the court child expert] no. in order to be satisfied or in order to reduce my concern in terms of the paternal grandparents being able to mitigate risk, i would be looking at whether or not they themselves accept the father’s behaviour as he has acknowledged it, and any findings that her honour may make in terms of the father’s behaviour, and that they therefore are willing to protect [x] from any assessed risk of harm having this insight in their own right into what those risks may be.[122]
