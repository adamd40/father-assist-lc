legal principles
working out if persons have a relationship as a couple   a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if:   the persons are not legally married to each other, and (b) the persons are not related by family (see subsection (6)), and (c) having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis. paragraph (c) has effect subject to subsection (5).   having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.   those circumstances may include any or all of the following:   the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.   the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them,   whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship,   no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. (4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case.   a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case.   for the purposes of this act: (a) a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and (b) a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship.   a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and (b) a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship.   a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship.
given the nature of the definition of a de facto relationship in the act, the ultimate decision as to whether there is a de facto relationship in any given time is a matter for the court and not a matter for the parties. although their perception of the nature of the relationship is a relevant matter, it is not determinative.
each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point in one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test.
those provisions, or their state counterparts, have been the subject of considerable judicial discussion, principally in an attempt to more precisely analyse what will comprise “a couple”. much of that analysis seems to have its genesis in the difficulty in satisfactorily distilling the essence of such a common, everyday concept. from those decisions the following propositions may be stated: (a) whether a de facto relationship exists or not is a question of fact, not a matter of discretion[10], (b) a de facto relationship does not need to be akin to a marriage[11] although the nature of the association involved in a marriage relationship may be instructive[12], (c) the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time[13], (d) whilst a composite expression, it is comprised of two parts “a couple” and “living together” each of which must be established[14],   whether a de facto relationship exists or not is a question of fact, not a matter of discretion[10], (b) a de facto relationship does not need to be akin to a marriage[11] although the nature of the association involved in a marriage relationship may be instructive[12], (c) the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time[13], (d) whilst a composite expression, it is comprised of two parts “a couple” and “living together” each of which must be established[14],   a de facto relationship does not need to be akin to a marriage[11] although the nature of the association involved in a marriage relationship may be instructive[12], (c) the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time[13], (d) whilst a composite expression, it is comprised of two parts “a couple” and “living together” each of which must be established[14],   the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time[13], (d) whilst a composite expression, it is comprised of two parts “a couple” and “living together” each of which must be established[14],   whilst a composite expression, it is comprised of two parts “a couple” and “living together” each of which must be established[14],   there need not be full time living together,[15] (f) the relationship may be unhappy, but still subsisting,[16] (g) sexual or other exclusivity is not necessary,[17] (h) the gist of the inquiry is the degree to which parties have merged their lives into one.[18] that connotes financial, emotional and physical interdependence.[19]   the gist of the inquiry is the degree to which parties have merged their lives into one.[18] that connotes financial, emotional and physical interdependence.[19]
impression and credit of the parties
the issue here, in my view, is not so much the veracity or reliability of the parties’ accounts of events, but rather, the picture presented by the totality of them and the conclusion/s resulting therefrom. ... i consider that the evidence of each of the parties was affected significantly by the fact that their recollection now, in respect of events past, was refracted through the prism of their own perceptions of the relationship and of the varying degrees of disappointment felt by each at its demise ...
the applicant
... [mr folmar] and i cohabited for the most part from february 2014 to october 2018. we were committed to each other to the exclusion of others. at the time i was convinced that our relationship was enduring. i have sighted of the affidavit by [ms e] and state that her assertions about our relationship is false and inaccurate. since filing these proceedings. i have received multiple threats from [ms e] and her associates, up until late 2020 threatening me to discontinue current proceedings against [mr folmar].
now produced and shown to me marked -7" is a letter from [ms g] to [mr folmar] dated 5 january 2015. i am in possession of the original copy of this document. in january 2015, [mr folmar] and i commenced renovations on [h street, suburb c]. the former tenants had vacated the property and the property was in desperate need of repair. we renovated this property to live in temporarily. we resided in the property whilst renovating it. the renovations were completed in/around may 2015. ... [f] lived with [mr folmar] and i in [h street, suburb c] during the week and he would spend time with my mother on weekends. [mr folmar] purchased a bed for [f] and [f] had his own bedroom. [mr folmar] was a father figure to [f]. ... over the period that [mr folmar] and i were in a relationship, [mr folmar] and i had many discussions and made plans for our future... [mr folmar] and i discussed having children once his divorce was finalised. we talked about spending the rest of our lives together and made many plans for our future. as set out in [mr folmar’s] affidavit, [mr folmar] and i travelled to perth, new south wales and queensland on numerous occasions for holidays. i paid for these holidays, we spent time with my father at his property in [suburb j]. all my friends and family knew us as a committed couple.... in 2015, [mr folmar] consulted with a solicitor to commence negotiations with his wife regarding their financial settlement and accordingly, a divorce. ...[mr folmar] told me that we had to be patient and in time, his wife would relent and consent to a divorce and a mutually acceptable financial settlement.
... shortly thereafter, our family and friends found out that we were engaged. ... in 2017, [mr folmar] filed for divorce from his wife. i paid the filing fee. [mr folmar] however filed a notice of discontinuance, just prior to serving a sentence in prison. i was pregnant at the material time. ...
... in 2018 when [mr folmar] was released from prison, he promised me that he would obtain a divorce from his wife. he then filed the necessary divorce application in court and the order was granted in 2018. in 2018 [mr folmar] was named as my de facto partner with dhhs.

submissions
the applicant’s submissions
evidence [ms pethrick] relies on her affidavit sworn 27 april 2021 and the exhibits annexed thereto. it is submitted that where [ms pethrick]’s evidence differs from the evidence given by [mr folmar] her evidence ought to be believed and she ought to be accepted as a witness of truth who gave a consistent account of the relationship and endeavoured to assist the court to the best of her ability. [mr folmar] on the other hand was evasive and refused to make concessions even when the evidence against his version of events was totally overwhelming (for example the circumstances leading to the tattoo of [ms pethrick]’s name on his neck (exhibit 12 (cb 215) which he described as being part of a drug fuelled binge that was demonstrably (by video) not the case). he ultimately conceded that in his own mind he and [ms pethrick] were boyfriend and girlfriend although he initially described their relationship as one of “drug buddies”. exhibit “ 9” (cb 164-185) are photographs of the parties including a number of photos that show [mr folmar] with [ms pethrick]’s son [f] in a variety of situations and at a variety of ages. they are consistent with [ms pethrick]’s evidence of [mr folmar] having a role as a father figure to her son [f]. 23 (cb 296-302) are more photos which show [ms pethrick] and [f] with [mr folmar] and his children in a variety of situations that appear to demonstrate an easy familiarity and a blending of their families. exhibit “17” (cb 262-270) is comprised of a series of letters from [ms pethrick] to [mr folmar] in the period 20 april 2014 to 8 july 2017 and gives a contemporaneous account of the relationship between the parties including the period in mid 2017 when [mr folmar] was in prison (he was imprisoned from 2017 –2018). “18” (cb272 – 276) shows payments of money by [ms pethrick] to support [mr folmar] in prison. the respondent’s case outline reveals (cb 724-756) that [mr folmar] was again imprisoned [in] 2018 and remained in jail until 2018. his imprisonment on this occasion was in respect of breaches of the intervention order taken out by the applicant. significantly it is submitted, on his release from prison on 30 august “the parties lived together for a period of 5 weeks...” a consistent theme throughout the case outline is the minimisation of the nature of the relationship, a theme that was continued in cross examination even when the facts (such as the tattoo) belied the attempts to portray the couple as something akin to friends with benefits. “ 14” (cb 222-238) are copies of engagement cards and “ 13” are the receipt and valuation for the engagement ring that [ms pethrick] received from [mr folmar] on the [region s] when on her evidence, the parties were in queensland so that [mr folmar] could seek [ms pethrick]’s father’s blessing for their marriage. [mr pethrick] relies on the letter sent by [ms d] solicitor (exhibit 1 to the affidavit of [ms d] sworn 12 october 2021 and exhibit “21” to the affidavit of [ms pethrick]) which set out [mr folmar]’s instructions to [ms d] regarding the relationship between him and [ms pethrick]. whilst [ms d] has since sought to walk back the language used in her letter as being based on “general paragraphs” which “i used to provide a context as to how the parties knew each other” it is submitted that such an explanation ought not be accepted particularly in circumstances where [ms d] failed to disclose to the court in her evidence in chief that she had provided the draft of the letter to [mr folmar] and that she had spoken to him before the final letter was sent. it is noted further that [mr folmar] asserted that he didn’t read the letter in draft before it was sent to [ms pethrick] which itself defies belief given his very keen interest in having the caveats removed and his personal property returned and is directly contrary to [ms d]’s evidence that she had no doubt that he had read the draft when he spoke to her before the letter was sent. it is noted that the letter is replete with the language of a genuine domestic relationship including “estranged partner” “commenced a relationship in or around 2015 and began living together on a genuine domestic basis within a few months (“the relationship”) and that “it is understood the relationship broke down irretrievably in or around 5 october 2018”. the proposition that [ms d] simply jumped to conclusions based on her own mistaken assumptions (at para 12 of her affidavit) is unsustainable. [ms d] could not have simply made up the dates that she included in her letter nor the specific allegations of a “genuine domestic relationship” that she made on [mr folmar]’s behalf – that information must’ve come from him. it is further noted that in her affidavit [ms d] has re-defined the relationship referred to in her letter as a “friendship” in circumstances where she does not depose to the basis upon which came to that descriptor having not had any further instructions from [mr folmar]. finally, [ms d] does say in paragraph 12 that she recalls being instructed by [mr folmar] that the parties “would stay at the applicant’s ([ms pethrick]) house some nights and at his house on other nights”. ... in all the circumstances and on the totality of the evidence it is submitted that the court ought be satisfied on the balance of probabilities that relationship between the parties meets the requirements of s4aa of the act.
the respondent’s submissions  the applicant’s mother [ms t], (b) the applicant’s father [mr u],   any of the persons who allegedly signed and sent the alleged various engagement cards,   treating doctors, and (e) the various other professionals, the applicant has neglected, failed, or refused to do so in support of establishing her case. in contradistinction, the respondent called and filed affidavits by [ms e] and [ms d] both of whom were available for cross examination. it is to be noted the applicant declined to even test by way of cross examination [ms e]’s evidence and her affidavit was tendered into evidence unchallenged. that evidence also supports the contentions of the respondent [exhibit r12]. similarly, an affidavit of [ms d], solicitor, of [d law] was filed and it should be noted that in taking that step the respondent deliberately and intentionally waived all his rights to legal professional privilege. [ms d] was available for cross examination and was cross examined by the applicant’s counsel at large. [ms d’s] evidence supported the contention of the respondent, with respect to the relationship being “volatile” and was an, “on and off” relationship. [exhibit r11]. submissions of [ms d] will be dealt with later in this address. the credit of the applicant is an issue as the applicant stated in evidence that she was unaware of her duty of disclosure, despite being represented by the same legal practitioners throughout these proceedings. the applicant’s instructors were present on each and every occasion this matter has been before the court and orders were made, many of which were made “by consent”. the non-disclosure by the applicant of bank account details, mortgages, contracts for purchase sale and taxation returns with respect to her finances as set out in the orders of 6 may 2020 (made by consent) and 14 may 2020 and subsequently in letters to her solicitors requesting the same for her solicitor to be provided cannot be ignored. in contrast, the respondent has complied with orders for disclosure and any request for documents made by the solicitors for the applicant. in giving her evidence the applicant stated that she had provided bank statements to her solicitors, but this was subsequently found to be completely untrue and such evidence was never presented to the court. the applicant’s evidence was full of graphic inconsistencies with declarations of love for the respondent. the facts are the respondent spent some 11 months in prison largely due to breaches of an intervention order application taken out by the applicant on 28 january 2017. the applicant’s reporting the respondent to victoria police led directly to the imprisonment of the respondent at a time when she claimed to be in love with the respondent and in a genuine de facto relationship with him the applicant’s evidence was self-serving, misleading and avoided the truth of her residence, and her relationship with the respondent. this submission is supported by the following:   selective use of the department of health and human services (“dhhs”) report [exhibit r5], (b) services australia parenting payment, child care benefit, and other benefit documents produced only after the respondent’s application, and court order for the applicant to sign the necessary freedom of information (“foi”) application to have her services australia/centrelink file released 28 april 2021, noting the applicant opposed the application until ordered by the court on the day of the court appearance, 13 april 2021 [exhibit r1], (c) new south wales district court bail documents wherein the applicant was strictly bailed to live at [r street, suburb b] property with her mother from 2014 until 2018 [exhibit r3], (d) the australian electoral commission email dated 30 may 2016 and apparent failure to vote notice dated 19 march 2016 addressed to the applicant at [v street, suburb j], noting the applicant was enrolled to vote at the property located at [r street, suburb b], in the state of victoria [exhibit r4], (e) the failure to tender or disclose the purchase contract agreement and mortgage details regarding the joint purchase of [r street, suburb b], in the state of victoria with her mother [ms t]. a call was made during the hearing for the documents but went unanswered. (f) the purchase details of [p street, suburb c] property were not provided and no details of any bank accounts from where monies were withdrawn or the loan attaching to that matter was disclosed and the applicant’s financial statement is silent on the relevant point. see applicant’s amended financial statement [exhibit a4].

d. conclusions this case is no different to any other case in which the court has to make a decision. the authorities say that it is the facts that will determine whether or not these parties satisfy to the requisite standard the implementation of section 4aa(1)(c) including the factors set out under section 4aa(2) to enliven this court’s jurisdiction. the applicant’s counsel in their closing submissions stated that the de facto relationship subsisted for the whole of four (4) years and nine (9) months, including periods when the respondent was in prison. it is acknowledged that parties can live on a genuine domestic basis even though they did not share a common residence throughout, but this proposition is simply not supported by the totality of the evidence in this case in support of that submission her counsel stated that the applicant ought to be accepted as a witness of the truth. when examined objectively this submission as to the applicant’s credibility can not possibly be accepted by the court. the applicant’s evidence, was consistently argumentative, inconsistent, and false. on many occasions it descended into the fanciful (rock in the jock). however, in relation to vital evidence there were so many inconsistencies in what the applicant alleged. they were:   her residence: on numerous occasions the applicant indicated to various authorities and institutions that her residence was that of [r street, suburb b], a property owned by her mother. it was a strict bail condition that she had to reside at that address. (b) on a number of occasions the applicant applied to obtain commonwealth support which was directly related to her paying rent at [r street, suburb b]. on her documentary evidence this was from the period from 2013 until 2018. all of the said statements to the commonwealth were declared true and correct and signed by the applicant herself. (c) on her commonwealth bank statement 3 her address was shown to be [r street, suburb b]. (d) the bail document r3 was clear about the applicant’s required residential address.   on a number of occasions the applicant applied to obtain commonwealth support which was directly related to her paying rent at [r street, suburb b]. on her documentary evidence this was from the period from 2013 until 2018. all of the said statements to the commonwealth were declared true and correct and signed by the applicant herself. (c) on her commonwealth bank statement 3 her address was shown to be [r street, suburb b]. (d) the bail document r3 was clear about the applicant’s required residential address.   on her commonwealth bank statement 3 her address was shown to be [r street, suburb b]. (d) the bail document r3 was clear about the applicant’s required residential address.   the bail document r3 was clear about the applicant’s required residential address.
failure to call independent corroborative witnesses throughout these proceedings the applicant has failed to call any corroborative witness. this relates to her mother in relation to residence, the alleged engagement, the situation regarding [f]’s residence, and the engagement ring. it could have also included providing details of the financial position with respect to the joint purchasing of [r street, suburb b]. the applicant failed to produce or tender the purchase contract, the mortgage or loan applicant documents or bank statements which is the property she jointly bought jointly with her mother. the failure to call her father in relation to the alleged engagement and/or any one of the persons who allegedly sent engagement cards. the failure to cross examine [ms e] whose clear evidence the applicant had known about since 17 april 2020 which corroborates the respondent’s contentions. again, compare that with the respondent who called [ms e] and waived professional privilege to call [ms d]. there is no evidence that would show [ms d] was not an honest and truthful witness and the position concerning surrounding the obtaining of instructions from the respondent were consistent with the respondent’s contentions. the less than convincing attempt by the applicant to establish a genuine family dynamic involving the applicant, the respondent and the child [f]. the attempt by the applicant to indicate that [f] was a part of her household was contradicted in the very document the applicant attempted to rely on, namely the dhhs report, and when confronted with the entirety of that report, the applicant said it was “all lies and crap”. the court cannot ignore or place little weight on the fact that during the applicant’s alleged period of co-habitation, that she or victoria police on her behalf, took out intervention order applications against the respondent by way of a safety notice dated 28 january 2017 to prevent the respondent from being within 200 metres of her residence, that being [r street, suburb b]. a final intervention order was made against the respondent on 18 october 2017 with the respondent not to go within 200 metres of [r street, suburb b], and that restriction is in place until 2039. in addition, the respondent as a result of breaching intervention orders was imprisoned for about 11 months between 2017 and 2018. this is inconsistent with the parties being in a genuine de facto relationship. this submission receives corroboration from the applicant who indicated to the respondent by way of letter headed 17 june 2017 they “had nothing” and, “friendship is all we can be”. (emphasis added) thus on the totality of the facts and given the required standard of proof the applicant must meet, the court could not find that the applicant or respondent meet the criteria under section 4aa(1),(2) and (3) and the respondent is accordingly entitled to a declaration that the parties did not reside in a de facto relationship between january 2014 and 7 october 2018.
consideration
relevant circumstances under s.4aa(2) the duration of the relationship, the nature and extent of their common residence,
living together for the purposes of s 4aa(1) will often, perhaps usually, mean cohabitation of some residence by a couple for some period of time. but cohabitation of a residence or residences is not a necessary feature of "living together". that phrase must be construed to take account of the many various ways in which two people may share their lives together in the modern world. two people, for any number of reasons, may not reside in the same residence, but nonetheless be in a de facto relationship in the sense required by s 4aa. )
the language of s 4aa of the act and its reference to "living together" requires no different approach to determining whether a relationship exists of the kind defined. "living together", consistently with authority, should be construed as meaning sharing life as a couple. section 4aa does not prescribe any way by which a couple may share life together. its language is sufficiently broad to accommodate the great variety of ways a de facto relationship may exist. that conclusion is supported by the varied factors listed in s 4aa(2). in a given case, some of the factors listed in s 4aa(2) may be relevant and some may be irrelevant, inevitably some may have greater prominence than others... in particular, s 4aa(4) is a statutory recognition that what may constitute a genuine de facto relationship is not be determined in the same way in every case by reference to rigid criteria that must always be satisfied. in that respect, the language of s 4aa(2)(b) does not assume that every de facto relationship must have a "common residence" to some "extent" and of some "nature". such a construction is entirely denied by s 4aa(3). whether a sexual relationship existed, the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life,
