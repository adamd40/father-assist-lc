the applicable law – parenting proceedings
... in summary, in dealing with any parenting application by a person interested in the care, welfare or development of a child, a court will determine that application applying the relevant provisions of part vii to determine whether making (or not making) a parenting order would be in the child's best interests.   in re andrew the full court observed that the welfare of the child remains the paramount consideration and in considering such welfare, the court must take into account any anxiety held by the primary carer concerning the child’s potential harm where such anxiety is likely to adversely impact that person’s care-giving ability. in taking account of the beliefs of the primary carer and the effects of such beliefs on that person and the consequent harm to the child, a subjective test is required. (b) however it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: russell & close. (c) a decision to sever the relationship between a parent and a child is one which the court would ordinarily make only with considerable hesitation: sedgley (d) it is only in cases where a conclusion is reached that there was no unacceptable risk that the court would need to consider the separate question of the primary carer’s belief in the occurrence of events in question: russell & close. (e) it is not necessary that the belief should be reasonably and objectively based, but rather whether it is genuinely held: russell & close. (f) despite no apparent expert evidence in support of the primary carer’s apprehension, the full court in dunst & dunst [2016] famcafc 15 at [119] did not criticise the trial judge for concluding that whilst the available evidence fell short of proving the primary carer’s capacity would deteriorate and impinge the children’s best interest (there having been a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (‘ptsd’) and expert evidence of the genuineness of the apprehension but not about such apprehension impinging capacity), the trial judge nonetheless found that the primary carer’s fear was genuine and objectively reasonable and remained a feature of the evidence favouring curtailment of the children’s interaction with the other party. (g) the court has made a “no time” order in circumstances where the psychological evidence was that if time or communication was ordered, the mother’s already poor mental health would deteriorate further and negatively affect her parenting capacity and that further treatment would not diminish her fear: gallagher & gomez [2017] famca 944 at [142]- [157], (h) the court did not make a “no time” order because in that case, there was little evidence, beyond the mother’s inevitable devastation and horror, to suggest that she could not continue to successfully parent the children. notably in that case, the trial judge observed that there was no evidence from her psychologist or counsellor, much less a psychiatrist, as to her likely being unable to continue to function effectively so as to adequately care for the children: hollister & gosselin [2016] famca 759 at [193]. (my emphasis)   however it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: russell & close.

rather to leave that decision to x provided that for now, x can have postal communication with her father at her request and it will only be when she reaches 14 years of age that the communication between them (at her request) can be of a more spontaneous nature. this regime will avoid the risk of the child’s parental relationships being adversely affected either because she inappropriately
