caravan site ] in or around april 2017, [ms walter] and i purchased a caravan situated at site number [k street, caravan park, town l] ("the caravan") for about $8,000. i undertook works to the caravan such as new flooring, custom windows and doors, landscaping of paving and barbecue area on the side installing decks and a kitchen that was purchased by [ms walter] with funds accrued from income of [company j]. this caravan was subject to interim property settlement in accordance with orders of 25 january 2021. i no longer have an interest in the caravan, [ms walter] has a sole interest in the caravan and the value of the caravan is said to be $30,000 as set out in notations made by the court on 25 january 2021.
caravan was damaged significantly from the storms in 2022 and the wife is requires to repair the caravan by replacing the roof, new interior walls, new flooring, new lounge, new dining chairs and table new air conditioner.
jewellery  on 8 january 2020, the wife and the children were staying in the caravan at town l when the wife decided to go into a women’s refuge to hide from the husband. she was told not to bring anything of value so she says she intentionally left the ring hidden in the caravan. (b) on 1 february 2020, the wife cancelled the insurance policy whilst at the shelter. (c) from january to june 2020 the husband had access to the caravan. (d) on 23 june 2020, the wife returned to the caravan to discover, she says, that the ring was not there. (e) on 27 june 2020, the wife says she reported the missing ring to the police who told her that it was a family law property dispute and declined to make a report.   on 1 february 2020, the wife cancelled the insurance policy whilst at the shelter. (c) from january to june 2020 the husband had access to the caravan. (d) on 23 june 2020, the wife returned to the caravan to discover, she says, that the ring was not there. (e) on 27 june 2020, the wife says she reported the missing ring to the police who told her that it was a family law property dispute and declined to make a report.   from january to june 2020 the husband had access to the caravan. (d) on 23 june 2020, the wife returned to the caravan to discover, she says, that the ring was not there. (e) on 27 june 2020, the wife says she reported the missing ring to the police who told her that it was a family law property dispute and declined to make a report.   on 23 june 2020, the wife returned to the caravan to discover, she says, that the ring was not there. (e) on 27 june 2020, the wife says she reported the missing ring to the police who told her that it was a family law property dispute and declined to make a report.   on 27 june 2020, the wife says she reported the missing ring to the police who told her that it was a family law property dispute and declined to make a report.  ] on 28 july 2020, my solicitors received draft joint letters of instruction for the following:
a. [company af] to value the matrimonial furniture at the [m street, suburb n] property, and b. [mr ag] of [ag] jewellers to value the matrimonial jewellery.  ] included in these joint letters of instructions was a list of items to be valued. later that day, my solicitors sent a letter to [ms walter’s] solicitors noting that a considerable amount of items were missing from the itemized lists contained in the draft joint letters of instruction, some of which was [ms walter’s] 3-caret diamond wedding ring, my watch which [ms walter] was in possession of at the time, and [ms walter’s] diamond wedding band. [73] to this, [ms walter’s] solicitor responded later that day and mentioned that, “the wedding band and engagement ring are not in my client's possession. i am instructed she left them hidden in the caravan and when she has returned to the caravan they are not there”. in response my solicitors sought confirmation of the dates when [ms walter] alleged that the jewellery became missing from the caravan and if she had made any claim on her insurance concerning the jewellery or made a report to the police. [74] on 4 august 2020, my solicitors received a letter from [ms walter’s] solicitor which confirmed that [ms walter] did not make a claim to her insurance as she had cancelled her policy on i february 2020. further, [ms walter] did not make a report to the police in circumstances where, “she did not realise until 27 june 2020 that the rings were missing.” in the letter, [ms walter] had assumed that i took the items from the caravan (as there had been no break in), despite me not having access to the caravan ever since [ms walter] changed the locks in or around june 2020 (or prior). [75] subpoenas were issued by my solicitors to [ms walter’s] jewellery insurance company as well as the nsw police. both subpoenas produced material that indicated that [ms walter] has not made any report to police that the jewellery were stolen. ...
q: i’m going to put it to you squarely. did you find and take the jewellery that was in that caravan? a: no.   it is not clear whether the jewellery said to be left in the caravan is a single ring or not. i proceed on the basis that it is and that it is the ring that was the subject of the insurance policy and it is the wedding ring that was purchased in 2011 for $55,000. (b) the wife’s absence of particulars in her narrative is striking, such as: any consternation or other options she considered about leaving such a valuable item in a caravan, the alleged abuse that she was urgently fleeing from, the manner in which she ‘hid’ the ring in the caravan, and, her efforts to locate the ring between 23 and 27 june 2020. (c) other striking aspects of her narrative that are unexplained include: why she did not report it to police for four days, her blasé description of the police supposedly not even making a report of a missing $55,000 ring, why there was no record produced under subpoena by the police of any report made to them at all, why she did not disclose any of this to the husband until he sought to value it over a year later, or if she thought that he had it as early as 27 june 2020, why she did not ask for it back, or at least confirm it with him after supposedly being sent away by the police. (d) perhaps the most difficult to accept aspect of the wife’s narrative is her decision to cancel the policy on 1 february 2020 after leaving the ring in relatively precarious circumstances on 8 january 2020.   the wife’s absence of particulars in her narrative is striking, such as: any consternation or other options she considered about leaving such a valuable item in a caravan, the alleged abuse that she was urgently fleeing from, the manner in which she ‘hid’ the ring in the caravan, and, her efforts to locate the ring between 23 and 27 june 2020.

wife’s loan from her parents 9] my total expenses are $1,520.00 per week, which means my shortfall is approximately $409.00 per week. i am required to borrow money off my parents to assist in the payment of the above expenses. although my parents had the benefit of $100,000.00 as a gift from me, this was in 2012 and almost 12 years ago. i have borrowed significant amounts of money from my parents throughout these proceedings, including continuing to pay legal fees as i cannot afford them on my own. [144] when i first obtained legal advice, i obtained a loan through [company ah]. i could not afford the repayments from [company ah]. when the [m street, suburb n] property was sold, [company ah’s] outstanding fees were paid out in the sum of $159,100.00 (being the australian executor’s trustee). i no longer have a contract with [company ah] and pay my legal fees outright, with the assistance of my parents. my parents expect me to repay the monies loaned to me in the sum $130,000.00 inclusive of all monies i have borrowed from them since separation. i anticipate this debt will rise once i borrow monies for the payment of this trial. i am already worried that i will not have the capacity to repay them and if i am required to refinance the [c street, suburb d] property, i will not have the capacity to meet the above expenses for the children or myself.

legal fees
‘11.6 ... section 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out’.   it is always important to have regard to the source of funds for payment of any legal fees, (b) if the funds used to pay legal fees existed at separation, either as cash in an account or an asset that has been disposed of, and the other party can be seen as having an interest in that asset, then usually the legal fees should be added back to the pool, (c) if the source of funds to pay legal fees was post separation earnings then, usually, the paid legal fees will not be added back.   if the funds used to pay legal fees existed at separation, either as cash in an account or an asset that has been disposed of, and the other party can be seen as having an interest in that asset, then usually the legal fees should be added back to the pool, (c) if the source of funds to pay legal fees was post separation earnings then, usually, the paid legal fees will not be added back.   if the source of funds to pay legal fees was post separation earnings then, usually, the paid legal fees will not be added back.

justice & equity
“in our view the correct principle was laid down by asche j in in the marriage of magas [1980] famca 67, [1980] flc 90-885, a decision of the full court on appeal from the family court of western australia. his honour said there at 75,591:
“if arrangements can be made which would relieve the spouse who is working a farm as a farmer from selling the farm but at the same time doing proper justice to the claim of the spouse who is not living on the farm, then of course those arrangements should be made.”
however, his honour then went on to say:
“if there is no other way to do that which is just and equitable then a sale must take place. it becomes an incident to the sad fact that when two persons separate property which might have given them together a reasonable competence will not be sufficient for each when divided. that is an inescapable situation and cannot be used as an argument to deprive one party of that to which he or she is otherwise properly entitled.”   there ought to be an additional 2.5 per cent adjustment in favour of the wife such that her interests amount to 72.5 per cent of the total value. i have considered that this may also have been a position arrived at under section 75(2)(o). i do not consider that pathway would have made any difference to the overall effect. on the balance sheet that i have determined, that equates to an alteration of $286,992 less the value of the husband’s superannuation entitlements of $22,980 equals an alteration to the value of $264,012, (b) the manner in which the parties’ interests are altered be considered. since norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, [1986] 10 famlr 819, it is well settled that the court can adopt either a global approach or an asset by asset approach to property proceedings under section 79. the latter approach has been referred to as a “two pools approach” to distinguish the treatment of superannuation interests from other property. (see c v c [2005] famca 429, [2005] flc 93-220). whilst a global approach has been taken to the assessment of contributions and future needs, it is necessary to adopt a two pools approach to the orders in order to achieve a just and equitable result whilst being mindful of maximising the opportunity for the wife to retain the c street, suburb d property.   the manner in which the parties’ interests are altered be considered. since norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, [1986] 10 famlr 819, it is well settled that the court can adopt either a global approach or an asset by asset approach to property proceedings under section 79. the latter approach has been referred to as a “two pools approach” to distinguish the treatment of superannuation interests from other property.

(b) the wife pay to the husband the settlement sum of two hundred and thirty-two thousand three hundred and eighteen dollars ($232,318) within six (6) weeks. this will provide for a division of the combined non-superannuation and superannuation property pool, as determined by the final balance sheet and the preceding superannuation split, of 72.5 / 27.5 in the wife’s favour. thereby providing the husband with that to which he is entitled whilst providing the wife with an opportunity to make arrangements which would relieve her from selling the c street, suburb d property if possible. (c) in the event the wife is unable to make such arrangements within the specified time, there be by default a sale of the c street, suburb d property and the proceeds distributed in accordance with the entitlements determined herein. (d) contemporaneously upon the wife’s compliance with the payment order, the husband remove the caveat lodged against the c street, suburb d property.
