the evidence  that the father perpetrated family violence within the meaning of the family law act 1975 (cth) (‘the act’) by, “often throwing my items against the wall and breaking them. he would then blame me for his actions. mr rowe often laid in bed for days at a time and completely withdraw [sic] from me and from x.” i note that on the mother’s evidence such conduct in relation to x could only have been during his first three months of his life, and (f) that the father was disinterested in caring for x as a baby and did not assist her in caring for x, and on an occasion when he was caring for x in the bath he left him unattended in the bath to take a business call and walked out of the bathroom, causing the mother to have run in to be with x.   that the father was disinterested in caring for x as a baby and did not assist her in caring for x, and on an occasion when he was caring for x in the bath he left him unattended in the bath to take a business call and walked out of the bathroom, causing the mother to have run in to be with x.
...was verbally and physically abusive, threatening me with false allegations of abuse that she would make to police to have me removed from the house, and she gouged my arm when i would not argue with her.
...went on holiday together and we took outings to restaurants, markets, historic houses, zoos, parks and festivals. i would look after [x] while [ms osborne] went shopping and she would let me take [x] to the park, but she would not allow me to take [x] to see my family or relatives.
he immediately flipped out yelling abuse. told me i always provoke him to want to punch me.
every time i see mr rowe he sexually harasses me and tries to physically touch me and kiss me. he says to x: “tell mummy to kiss me, tell mummy to hug me”.”
he was previously on parachoc for constipation. he has not required any aperients in the last two years since his mother has taken him to a naturopath. he is on a diet low in wheat and low in sugar with good effect. he now opens his bowels daily. he has no concerns nor do his parents, regarding his bowel motion.
and:
overall, [x] seems to be doing very well. the diet recommended by his naturopath seems safe and balanced. we have encouraged [x] to have small amounts of wheat in his diet to allow for a tolerance when he is outside of the care of his parents.
and further:
it was a pleasure to see [x] and his parents in clinic today. overall, he has no significant concerns. his constipation seems to have completely resolved.
on the way to [location am] he was telling me about the trip to [country al] and he said “mummy says that you prevented us from going overseas” and i said “that’s not true”. x said “what does that mean?” and i said “that something may not have occurred and it could be called a lie.” he’s heard the word “lie” and gone home and connected it, because he is a smart kid. when it comes to me he spends the first half-hour fact-checking what his mother has said to him and i try to explain things without denigrating his mother, there are orders not to denigrate each other, but it’s hard to keep the line between not denigrating and answering him and telling him how things are.
with my cousin [mr u] at [suburb v] for the first several occasions, five minutes from where [x] lives, for the two occasions. then after the first two nights, to [suburb w] to stay for one night per fortnight the first few months then two nights per fortnight for a couple of months. i would introduce [x] slowly to [ms an] before he stays there....i can’t take [x] from [suburb w] to [suburb t], it is 45 minutes, so once it goes to 4 nights i’d moved to [suburb t] to live.
it does appear that the parents are able to interact amicably when they are required to have face to face interaction with each other. for example, at changeover and appointments for [x].
...that x is “excited” to spend time with mr rowe because x has an enjoyable day out with him. she said that x’s relationship with mr rowe continues to develop as does mr rowe’s “learning” about parenting and x’s needs...she conceded that x’s relationship with mr rowe is positive.
...she could also see the benefit for [x], having his father residing close by. [ms osborne] said that it would be nice for [x], if [mr rowe] could be more involved in his school, after-school and weekend sports and activities (such as taking [x] to these and encouraging [x] in his training or games). she said, however, that she has no faith that [mr rowe] will actually relocate to sydney for [x].
the family report and ms f’s evidence
...was instead looked after by his parents throughout the day, either going out for walks or waiting in the reception area sitting between them. this arrangement seemed to be the preference of both [x] and his parents. [x] was observed to happily go between his parents on the day, inviting them to both play hide and seek with him. [mr rowe] and [ms osborne] were observed to communicate and interact with each other amicably about the care and needs of [x] throughout the day.
...though he suggested that his mother does not allow this. [x] said that he would like to spend overnight time with [mr rowe] because their time is limited to the “day” and because his father has told him that they do not get to spend enough time together. ...[x] said he feels ready for overnight time with his father to commence soon. he commented, “i’ll miss my mummy, but i’m a big boy, so i won’t miss mummy (too much)”. [x] said that if he gets upset about missing his mother, he would hug his father. [x] said that if he has to wait to next year to commence overnight time with [mr rowe], he would feel “sad”.”  ’s time with [mr rowe] appeared lively and interactive and [x] seem familiar with his father joining in his play. this observation session suggests that [x] has a positive and comfortable relationship with [mr rowe], who interacted with [x] in a loving and attentive way.  ] [x] presents as a good-natured five year old who is well loved by his parents...it appears that [x] loves both of his parents. his relationship with his mother is considered more established and secure, noting that she has been [x]’s primary carer for the past five years and that [x] sought out his mother for emotional support on the day of the family report interviews. [x]’s relationship with [mr rowe] appears to be developing closely and positively and [x] did not raise any concern in his father’s care. [82] ...it is important that both [mr rowe] and [ms osborne] follow any recommendations by health professionals regarding the assessed needs and benefit for [x] in regard to his diet. [84] should the court determine that [mr rowe] perpetrated coercive controlling family violence towards [ms osborne], then it is recommended that he complete a men’s behaviour change course. should the court find, however, that the type of violence as alleged by [ms osborne] did not occur, then it is possible that [ms osborne]’s experience of [mr rowe] could be attributed to difficulties in her relationship with [mr rowe], the subsequent relationship breakdown and the poor co-parenting relationship.
the risks to [x] in having a parenting arrangement of significant and substantial time is that this may expose him to parental conflict. this risk is increased based on the poor co-parenting relationship between [mr rowe] and [ms osborne] and due to the very likely need for the parents to have an increased level of communication and co-operation between them about [x]’s needs. children who are exposed to prolonged parental conflict may experience difficulties such as anxiety, depression, sleep problems, low self-esteem and school problems. they are also at greater risk of experiencing acute conflicts of loyalty.
...other than [x]’s dietary needs, [ms osborne]’s concerns about [mr rowe]’s poor parenting skills appeared to the family consultant to be lacking in substance and detail. she appeared to have a limited capacity to consider the benefit to [x] in him having substantial time with [mr rowe] (and the paternal family) or having [mr rowe] considerably involved in [x]’s life. ...if [x]’s relationship with [mr rowe] continues to develop positively and [mr rowe] demonstrates an ability to continue to meet [x]’s needs, in the absence of risk, there is considered to be the potential for [x] to spend substantial time with his father, particularly, if [mr rowe] relocates to live close to [x].
this assessment supports, as the next step, the progression of [x]’s time to occur on an overnight basis (from saturday morning until sunday afternoon in alternate weeks).  ] noting [x]’s young age, this assessment would also support [ms osborne]’s proposal that [x]’s commencement of overnight time, occur within the [suburb t] area on the first few occasions. [92] in the event that [mr rowe] does not relocate to live in sydney, but has regular weekend overnight time with [x], it is recommended that the location of [x]’s overnight time with his father is a consistent venue for [x] (be this with friends or in a hotel). this is important to provide [x] some consistency and familiar environment in his parenting arrangement. [93] ... due to the potential for substantial time, it seems important that both parents be involved in significant decisions about [x]. the family consultant is unable to make a clear recommendation in relation to parental responsibility.
the law  whether the child spending equal time with each parent would be in the best interest of the child,[3] and (b) whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[4]   whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[4]
a discretionary judgment concerning the parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[6]   assess whether that risk is an acceptable risk or an unacceptable risk, (2) if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.
..."meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". ...when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitative one. quantitative concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.

any views expressed by x and any factors, such as x’s maturity or level of understanding, that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to x’s views.
the nature of the relationship of x with each of his parents and other persons (including grandparents or other relatives).
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to x, to spend time with x, and communicate with x.
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain x.
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances, including the likely effect on x of any separation from either of his parents.
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with his father and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect x’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis.
the capacity of each of x’s parents to provide for x’s needs, including his emotional and intellectual needs.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background of x and of x’s parents.
the attitude to x, and the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of x’s parents.
any family violence involving x or a member of x’s family.
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x.

x’s surname
both parents remain entrenched in their views that it is in [x]’s best interest that he has their respective surname. [x] is at a developmental stage in which his sense of identity is developing. children wonder about the nature of the self and the way they understand and answer “who am i questions” may affect them for the rest of their lives. whether or not there is a change in [x]’s surname is a matter for the court. the parents are encouraged to refer and record [x]’s surname in accordance with the determination by the court, as this will reduce the amount of parental conflict that [x] may be exposed to.
in deciding the issue in each case there is no onus of proof. it is for the court to balance in its discretion the factors for and against change. the guiding principle is that the welfare of the child is the paramount consideration. it must stand above the wishes or proprietary interests of the parents.   the welfare of the child is a paramount consideration, (b) the short and long-term

the use of a hyphenated surname, in a number of ways, accords with the reality of j’s life. his mother is ms mckenzie, his father mr mahony. j is the product of their union. he would have a united surname. he has an on-going relationship with both of his parents, though they do not live together. the use of a hyphenated surname might facilitate the recognition by others of j’s life circumstances and the ease with which jay accepts his life circumstances. finally, the use of the hyphenated surname offers j a middle road in times of rapidly changing social attitudes...some persons would support the proposition that in theory, if not in the application to a particular child, there should no longer be a preference for the paternal surname. some people would support the right in ms mckenzie to revert to the use of her own family name upon the breakdown of her relationship with mr mahony. some people would support the right in ms mckenzie to apply her surname for j, where she is custodian. some would support the use of the combined surnames. as jay grows he will become aware of the attitudes in the community. he may develop feelings and ideas of his own about his surname and the use of the hyphenated surname would seem to provide him with a non-contentious platform from which he may choose to move in one direction or another, or to maintain the compromise.
