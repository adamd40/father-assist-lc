reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
i say that our marriage was loving and we enjoyed each other’s company. it seemed to me that the mother was as happy as i was. i conceded that our relationship was not perfect and the mother and i occasionally argued. however, i would consider that these arguments were typical of a married couple. these arguments were over typical household disagreements and never escalated to violence.[3]
as the father walked through the waiting room where the mother was, he said loudly, in the hearing of both the family consultant and the mother, “it would be different if she had ever worked a day in her life!” his inability to control himself verbally in the court setting in front of the family consultant who was assessing them, raised concern as to his level of self-control and what he might say around the mother and in front of the children.[12]
at the conclusion of the assessment concern did remain as to the parties’ high level of acrimony and the children’s ongoing risk of exposure to conflict, both directly and indirectly. it appeared evident that the parties had made no improvements to their post-separation relationship since engaging in the cdc with consultant ms e and nor was the consultant left with any confidence that this would improve over time.[15]
conduct of the proceedings
why cannot i see them 50/50 for the whole year??? i know because you lose money from centrelink...how deplorable...maybe different in 2 years when governments force you to work.[26]
legal principles applicable
parenting proceedings  ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.  iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.  aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[39]
...it is not as if, as soon as communication difficulties between the parties, or other difficulties between them are identified, the discretion ought not be exercised... rather, the matter is one of balancing all relevant factors...[51]
whilst parental responsibility is vaguely defined, some insight into what is needed from a parent can be seen in s 65dac(3) which provides that if both parents have that responsibility, they are taken to be required to consult about parenting issues and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision. it will again be remembered that the focus of the objects and principles in this act is on joint parenting.[56]  s a broad concept as described in s 61b and that task covers many things. parents are expected jointly to endeavour to promote their children’s development by ensuring they have the greatest potential in adulthood whilst at the same time enjoying the security of childhood they deserve.[57]
property
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[66]
it is well established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties’ respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the post separation period to the point of assessment.
if arrangements can be made which would relieve the spouse who is working a farm as a farmer, from selling the farm but at the same time doing proper justice to the claim of the spouse who is not living on the farm, then of course those arrangements should be made. ... if there is no other way to do that which is just and equitable then a sale must take place. it becomes an incident of the sad fact that, when two persons separate, property which might have given them together a reasonable competence will not be sufficient for each when divided. that is an inescapable situation and cannot be used as an argument to deprive one party of that to which he or she is otherwise properly entitled.[72]
in summary, then, the trial judge has a discretion as to how superannuation interests will be treated in a particular case. if superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to:
a) value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable. in the context of a consideration of the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of the last paragraph, the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse’s present and/or future entitlements under the fund.[74]
duty to provide disclosure
...the failure to disclose undermines the whole process of adjudication of proceedings for a settlement of property in that the court is unable to identify the property of the parties, to properly assess contributions, or to properly assess section 75(2) factors.[78]
the evidence
ms f  reported that his parents did not get along. he reported that a long time ago he witnessed them fight at which time “dad pushed mum and mum got angry to him, then [y] got sad, then i got brave and a little bit sad”. he explained that “dad pushed mum in the wall in their room...and he talk so loud and that’s it, that’s all i remember”. despite witnessing this violence [x] had no concerns his father would hurt his mother or him in the future. he also denied being exposed to denigration by either party.[80]
mr mullins
ms lien
i was a fulltime carer for [x]. i attended to all the housework. i cooked all the meals and did the cleaning up afterwards. i kept the house tidy to please the husband. my mother assisted me. ... after [y] was born i continued to undertake all the housework and do all the cooking and caring for the children. the children would make a mess, but i tidied up. i met all the children’s physical needs such as bathing, dressing, getting them their meals. the husband never cooked for me even when i came home from hospital after giving birth to [y]. occasionally the husband would tidy up the yard. he collected the dog droppings. the husband would come home from work in a very stressed state and would not be up to doing much around the house and yard. he was often too stressed to go for a walk with the children and me after dinner. ... the husband wanted me to become an australian. he did not like to eat [country k] food. he only liked some of it. where i used to eat rice three times a day in [country k], i had to adjust to an aussie diet. the husband liked food such as pasta, lasagne, and chicken schnitzel. i learned how to make these things because i wanted to make him happy. i ate this food too and became accustomed to australian culinary tastes. the husband liked a big fried breakfast on the weekends which i made for the family.[82]
