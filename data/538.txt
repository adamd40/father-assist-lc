despite her struggle to engage in the interview process, [y] was provided with many opportunities to disclose experiences of abuse, but consistently denied being tickled or touched on her vagina or bottom, or having spoken to her mother about being tickled. furthermore, [y] expressed knowledge in the interview that tickles to her vagina and bottom were not allowed as they were private areas which reflected [ms baird’s] (very appropriate) response to [y’s] previous request to be tickled on her vulva. however, of some concern, the cps noted that [y’s] presentation changed when asked about her tickles by her father, compared to when asked about tickles by [ms baird]. in this regard, [y] easily identified multiple body parts tickled by [ms baird], whereas she identified far fewer body parts when asked where [mr gillespie] tickled her. moreover, [y] spoke in a quieter voice and was more avoidant of questions when asked about her father, sometimes placing her soft toy between herself and the clinician, seemingly as a barrier to the conversation. in considering this response by [y], the cps was mindful that [y] had been separated from her father without contact for a number of weeks and that she may have noticed [ms baird’s] tension regarding [mr gillespie], leading her to feel unsure about discussing her father. the cps also considered that if [y] had experienced tickles to her genitals by her father she may be reluctant to discuss them for a number of reasons, such as her (relatively new) knowledge that tickles to her vulva and bottom were not appropriate or that the experience was traumatic. in considering [y’s] initial statements, the cps noted that the consistency of her statements over two separate occasions in addition to the simplicity of her statements and the lack of contextual detail she provided. in the absence of contextual detail, it was difficult for the cps to understand what [y] was trying to convey. whilst [y’s] statements could have reflected worrying experiences of abuse, the cps also considered alternative explanations for her statements such as age appropriate body exploration or games. in the absence of further concerns or disclosures the cps was unable to confirm that [y] would be placed under significant risk if contact with [mr gillespie] was reinstated. in considering this risk, it was necessary to balance the possibility that sexual abuse had occurred, with the significant emotional and relational impact of [mr gillespie’s] prolonged absence upon [y] and the family unit as a whole. moreover, in reflecting upon [y’s] ongoing protection and safety, the cps was reassured by [ms baird’s] protective capacity and held the view that if further concerns arose that she would manage these appropriately.
the department has finalised the assessment in relation to the concerns that were raised and wishes to advise that the allegation of “suspicious indicators consistent with sexual harm” has not been substantiated. whilst the threshold for substantiation has not been met in this case, the department would like to highlight that this does not mean there is no risk to the children. the department remains concerned that the disclosures of [y] could be indicative of the initial steps of sexual abuse and grooming behaviours. this concern is based on research and statistics around what is known of sexual offenders and this situation is very similar to early sexual abuse.
the department is recommending that any contact that [mr gillespie] has with your children is always supervised by another adult. the department will be closing this case as it has been assessed that no further statutory involvement is required.
...a concern that the disclosures of [y] could be indicative of the initial steps of sexual abuse and grooming behaviours. this concern is based on research and statistics around what is known of sexual offenders and this situation is very similar to early sexual abuse.
...some recognised scales for determining the risk of sex offending. it was concluded that the father’s scores “were not significant and none of the relevant indicators were significant”.
in other words, there was nothing in the sex offender risk assessment to indicate any significant indicators on the part of the father that he was a sex offender. in summary, dr g concluded under the heading of sex offender risk profile that the father was “low risk” and that, “none of the relevant indicators were significant”.
on the basis of the current information, it is my opinion that [mr gillespie] does not pose a significant risk of offending towards his family. his elevated suicidal ideation suggested that he was more a risk of harming himself were he to be prevented from re-establishing his relationship with children and partner.
