the family report
look, i guess, at the time of the writing the family report assessment i had significant concerns about the father making those flexible work arrangements based on the accounts provided to me, and there didn’t seem to be a clear pattern of him taking nights off work to ensure that he was spending regular and quality time with the children, kind of, of an evening outside of the business. so the situation may have changed but at the time that seemed to be the information that was being provided to me, and i was quite concerned about the children being at the business till late at night and the lack of supervision, etcetera, which i believe i detailed – like, made fairly clear in my report. but i guess i can’t answer just off the top of my head now what nights and how often the father should be spending the – the children should spend time with the father because, obviously, and as the court fully appreciates, there’s quite a bigger picture involved in making that decision. it’s not – you know, there’s a number of factors that need to be considered. issues around the well-being of the children in terms of their capacity to make regular transitions between two households that are very, very different with, at the time of writing the report, parents who were not able to provide clear expectations and routines for the children so that’s, kind of, i guess one issue to consider. another thing, i guess, just on the topic of the children spending additional mid-week time with the father for educational purposes, i guess, the court would need to, i guess, hear some evidence in regards and form some view as to the father’s actual capacity to provide for the children’s educational needs. so, you know, i guess, the court would need to be confident the father could do that in a – i guess, an attentive and respectful manner that didn’t make the children feel under undue pressure to be, kind of, performing and, you know, that the court would need to be considering, you know, the father’s skills in how he, kind of, manages that. it’s obviously something that the father’s passionate about, and we can assume that, you know, there’s certainly something that he can contribute to the children in terms of education very positively but in terms of weighing up, if there’s additional orders to kind of provide for that kind of time, i think the court would need to be, you know, making those sort of considerations about whether that’s in the children’s best interests. and, of course, about the reality of, you know, how much children really want to go to a parent and sit down and spend three hours studying once a week, you know. we need to work within reality of – and lessons for the young children and how much, you know, how – what’s actually in their educational best interests in terms of the homework because i wouldn’t want them to have arrangements that are putting a whole lot of pressure on to go and have this intensive kind of homework time with dad. it might not be positive for their relationship with dad as well. so i don’t know if that really answers it, but those are just some of my thoughts on that question. this further evidence was given by the family report writer in the above context: mr attar: yes. i’m just need to clear – to clear that to his honour that you’re recommending that the father spending more time with the kids during the week as well so in addition to quality time on the weekend so --- ? i didn’t make – as your honour has referred i haven’t made a clear recommendation that it is definitely my clinical opinion that that must occur. i think that is – the court could give consideration to it. i suppose in terms of working out orders that are in the best interests of the children, it’s about trying to look at the parents’ stress and trying to find a nice balance in how we can expose the children to the parents’ stress, and i suppose, you know, much was made by the father of the mother’s, i guess, you know, cognitive capacity and his involvement in their education in the past and so that is one area that the father might provide some strength. but, look, it needs to be kind of considered, as i said, in terms of the children’s capacity to, you know, cope with multiple transitions, the parents capacity to negotiate that additional time, you know. it’s a long time since i interviewed the children. i don’t really know much about the state of the children’s relationship with both parents so it’s difficult for me to, sort of, say conclusively that something must or must not occur. i mean, there’s probably likewise some disadvantages to additional time that might make it hard for the children too. you know, it might make it simpler for the children to just have the block time with the father rather than additional time. sorry, i was just going to say something else on that matter. i guess, i wouldn’t put undue focus on the children’s educational needs. of course, that’s important, but the children’s relationship with the father is important too, and i guess one of my concerns at the time of the family report was a bulk of the children’s time with the father seemed to be not really spending quality time with dad. it seemed to be being spent in the business and so i guess i was looking for, is there any opportunity where dad is really engaged and is, you know, focussed on the children where they could spend some quality time together so that is a possibility. so your honour it would need to – it is a consideration would be my answer to that question.
well, i guess that the description, and without, kind of, i guess, knowing more about it, it does raise concerns that it might not be the ideal living arrangement for the children. so, generally, we could make the assumption that it is ideal for children to have some privacy. it becomes increasingly important as they get older for them to have their own, kind of, sleeping arrangements wherever possible. i guess, in my clinical experience as well, i notice often children who co-sleep with their parents as they get older, it causes a number of difficulties for them as they get older in terms of just their – their developing independence and, like, example, going on school camps and things. i mean, there – so there’s – there’s a number of issues, sort of, the children’s privacy needs and, also, then around it not providing, i guess, for their – for their needs in terms of their increasing independence, and i don’t know what the arrangements are but it sounds like, then, i guess, the – [y] and [x] must be sleeping in the other bed together. i guess it – the concern it raises for me, too, is why would you put the children in that situation. so, in terms of providing an optimal household for the children whilst they’re with the father, it – it just – it begs the question of the father’s capacity to give consideration to what the children need and make suitable arrangements. so why would you not find the children have separate beds? why would you not have bunks? why would you not provide them with their own bed? and, i guess, that raised a red flag about the father’s capacity to make those judgments and then prioritise what the children need over – i mean, i’m not even sure why the bedding arrangement is what it is, whether that’s what the father prefers himself or whether that’s what’s in the apartment and organising other beds is, i don’t know, too much financially. but it – but it – you know, it also raises concerns about, i guess, the father’s parenting.
now, when they are with [mr attar] and spending time with him, assuming they go to bed late, do you maintain concerns and can you expand upon what your concerns are about the children not going to bed at a regular, appropriate time while in [mr attar’s] care? well, there’s a number of concerns. i mean, one is the – the lack of consistency between the two households. when children are going to have bedtimes at such vastly different times, it just makes their – i guess, their sleep patterns, you know, doesn’t – you know, get mixed up and they have difficulties with sleeping and waking. and so one is that, in terms of, i guess, their sleeping patterns. it can cause issues and, i guess, frustration and difficulties in their relationship with the parents when they’re, sort of, annoyed with one parent for providing a different rule, so, you know, all those sorts of problems. often, it – it creates problems in terms of children getting up in time and going to school, so it can feed into difficulties with partial school attendance and – and turning up to school late. it can cause difficulties with concentration if they’re, you know, really overtired in the classroom, so it can affect them educationally. we know that, you know, lack of sleep, if that’s what it results in, can cause – can impact on people’s mood. so, you know, really, it can – it can impact on them educationally, psychologically, relationally. so, you know, there’s a number of – of issues that it raises.
