determining the best interests of the children - the s.60cc considerations
the children's relationships[14]
however, of note, the mother’s attitudes and approach to facilitating court ordered time between the child and father impressed as protective but rather inflexible and oversimplified. an important aspect of parental responsibility includes the active encouragement and provision of direction to a child’s behaviour and choices, even in times when the child cannot fully see the reasons for what is being advocated. the parent’s chosen approach to such situations can certainly contribute and perpetuate the child’s feelings and behaviours to the situation, in this case, spending time with the father. further, there was also a strong indication that the mother has not adequately responded to the child’s needs in relation to identifying and communicating with the child about their feelings towards the father. this could also be contributing to the child’s difficulties in navigating this significant and emotional dilemma.
there was nothing obtained from the information available during the interviews that substantiate the father’s allegations that the mother has engaged in parental alienation with both children. the child’s views and feelings in particular appeared to be genuinely and independently held. there were no indications that the child has experienced negative influence from either parent about how to feel about the other parent.
