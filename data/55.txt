and the court notes that:
ex temporereasons for judgment
judge oâ€™shannessy
1 these are the settled reasons of a short form ex tempore judgment (section 69zl of the family law act 1975 (cth)). these reasons should be read in conjunction with my previous two judgments in this matter langmuir & fields [2021] fcca 1223 and langmuir & fields (no 2) [2021] fcca 2022.
2 in this matter, the first risk that i have to balance in the dispute between the parties is the risk of the children being exposed to conflict between the parties. in the view of mr s, a psychologist who has seen the children, the children are developing hypervigilance. i am not prepared to find on this interim hearing that that relates to the parenting of one parent as opposed to the other, rather the dynamic and history of what has happened in this matter. the dramatic nature of how this case unfolded cannot be lost sight of. the very dramatic matters that the child, x, had told the gp about, that set off and exacerbated the father's concern about his children's care within the mother's household must be re called. it has turned out that those allegations are most likely to be untrue or, at the very least, x has subsequently recanted what he said.
3 there is a high degree of conflict between the parents. it is clear that the mother is exasperated at having to undertake recovery orders and being put to the trouble and expense of justifying her parenting. she says that it has been proven to be otherwise perfectly ordinary parenting, and so her exasperation can be understood. i have found previously that the father had a low opinion of the mother's parenting, and there is a risk of the children being exposed to that.
4 there is another risk in this matter and that is the risk of unintentional abuse by the father because of his alcohol consumption. he has previously demonstrated to me quite considerable insight into that circumstance in that he revealed his treatment with dr l and his frank accounts of his condition with dr l. the fact that that was revealed by the father and not prised out of the medical information system by subpoena, is to his credit and demonstrates insight. the speed and the cooperation with which he fitted the breathalyser device to his car also demonstrates insight into what is required. the significance of the breathalyser is that without it i may not have been able to contemplate time with the father other than in limited circumstances.
5 i might say that i am not the slightest bit surprised that the father has been able to comply satisfactorily with that breathalyser device. the information that provides me is invaluable. i know that the burden is $230 per calendar month, but the reality is that without it the additional amount of money that the father will have to spend on lawyers proving his sobriety when driving or his lack of driving under the influence will be very substantial. it will cost him a lot more than $230 per month by the additional fuel for legal the dispute between the parents. it was and continues to be a significant matter for me in my determination of the children's welfare.
6 it is easy to underestimate the problem of a substance abuse or a reliance upon a substance. history teaches us that it is usually the person with the problem who underestimates it the most. we are fortunate here that the father recognises that he has a problem. the issue is whether he recognises sufficiently that he has the problem. the continuing dependence upon alcohol combined with the father's mental health vulnerability, in my view, persuades me on balance that there is an unacceptable risk for the larger block periods. i acknowledge the harshness of this for the father because he has recently had two block periods of a week at a time. i am persuaded that, on balance, the best interests of the children are best served by the orders as proposed by the icl, including the variations of the time, that is to make the start and end day longer.
