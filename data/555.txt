the court orders that:
ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge brown:
at the time of the [father's] application it was his position that the mother and children had left the former family home in [town f] and he did not know where they were. at the time he was subject to an interim intervention order which had been granted immediately following separation. the mother filed a response to the application in mid-may. on both an interim and final basis she sought orders that the children live with her and she have sole parental responsibility for them. pending final hearing, she proposed professionally supervised time at the [city h] children's contact service (“ccc”). she did not oppose a property settlement. the mother's reasons for seeking only professionally supervised time were expressed in the following terms:
the applicant and i separated on a final basis following four years of sexual, physical, emotional and financial abuse. for the last four years of our relationship the applicant raped me on no less than one or two occasions each week. in january of this year the abuse became horrific and there was a period of two weeks where the applicant raped me up to three times a day whilst the children were in the home. the children would regularly hear me screaming and yelling at the applicant to stop. however, the applicant would not.[1]
in september 2021 i was served with charge sheets and summonses by victoria police particularising 27 charges based on factual allegations relating to recklessly causing injury and rape within a date range of february 2011 to 20 february 2020.[3]
where one party to litigation is compelled, either by reason of a rule of court, or by reason of a specific order of the court, or otherwise, to disclose documents or information, the party obtaining the disclosure cannot, without the leave of the court, use it for any purpose other than that for which it was given unless it is received into evidence.[5]
it has been said, in a number of cases, that special circumstances must be established before leave is granted to release a person from such an undertaking.[8]
in order to be released from the implied undertaking it has been said that a party in the position of the appellants must show "special circumstances". it is unnecessary to examine the authorities in this area in any detail. the parties were not in disagreement as to the legal principles. the notion of "special circumstances" does not require that some extraordinary factors must bear on the question before the discretion will be exercised. it is sufficient to say that, in all the circumstances, good reason must be shown why, contrary to the usual position, documents produced or information obtained in one piece of litigation should be used for the advantage of a party in another piece of litigation or for other non-litigious purposes. the discretion is a broad one and all the circumstances of the case must be examined.[10]
in those circumstances i consider that justice requires that the father be able to use the material in the appropriate fashion without the risk of being forced to be in breach of the harman obligation, the acts or rules.[12]
as already discussed, the purpose for which the documents are to be used are in respect of criminal proceedings which involve the mother as the alleged victim. it is predominantly her affidavit material and the collateral and associated documents for which leave to be relieved from the implied undertaking is sought. i consider that there exists "special circumstances" which would justify a release from the implied undertaking.[14]
there can be no suggestion that the documents which were produced or obtained for the family law proceedings were obtained for or through any improper purpose. necessarily they arose in the context of an application for parenting orders and the documents were subpoenaed not by [mr siddell] himself, but by another party in the case concerning him, namely the independent children's lawyer.
it seems to me that the liberty to cross-examine witnesses in criminal prosecutions by reference to statements made by them, and documents discovered by them, affords a good reason for releasing the undertaking in these cases. the fact of the considerable overlap between the issue in the proceedings and the subject matter of the criminal prosecutions has the result that there is an overriding interest in favour of affording the use of the documents.[17]
