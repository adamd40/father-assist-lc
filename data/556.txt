the law  the applicant must first demonstrate hardship if deprived of the chance to bring her claim and the alleged hardship depends upon the prima facie strength of her claim. (a) the loss of a right to institute proceedings is not of itself a hardship. it is the consequences of the loss of that right, with which the subsection is concerned. (whitford & whitford [1979] famca 3, (1979) flc 90-612). to show hardship one must establish a “substantial detriment” (hall v hall [1979] famca 50, (1979) flc 90-679 at [78626]), (b) as to the prima facie strength of her claim, the applicable test is whether or not the applicant’s case has a “sufficient likelihood of success” (skelton & lindop [2022] fedcfamc1a 47 at [21]). (3) the decision to extend time still requires an exercise of discretion in the applicant’s favour even if she first establishes hardship. (a) numerous factors can influence the exercise of residual discretion, including the length of the delay, the adequacy of reasons for the delay, and the prejudice the respondent would suffer if the application for the extension of time was granted (arcand & boen [2021] famcafc 155 at [40]). (b) whilst explanations of these factors can be highly influential in the exercise of discretion, as a matter of principle, a failure to adequately do so is not fatal to obtaining leave (see emerald & emerald [2018] famcafc 217 at [128]).   the loss of a right to institute proceedings is not of itself a hardship. it is the consequences of the loss of that right, with which the subsection is concerned.

consideration of hardship
de facto financial cause means: (c) proceedings between the parties to a de facto relationship with respect to the distribution, after the breakdown of the de facto relationship, of the property of the parties or either of them.   a de facto financial cause that may be instituted under this act must not, after the commencement of this section, be instituted otherwise than under this act.   in this section, de facto financial provisions means the provisions under part viiiab--financial matters relating to de facto relationships. (2) parliament intends that the de facto financial provisions are to apply to the exclusion of any law of a state or territory to the extent that the law:   deals with financial matters relating to the parties to de facto relationships arising out of the breakdown of those de facto relationships, and (b) deals with those matters by referring expressly to de facto relationships (regardless of how the state or territory law describes those relationships).
prima facie strength of the claim
exercise of the discretion
length of the delay and adequacy of reasons for the delay  i did not seek a family law property settlement with [ms reilly] at the end of the defacto relationship because i just wanted to move on. [7] until recently, i had moved on with my life and believed that the financial relationship between myself and [ms reilly] had been finalised.
the prejudice the respondent would suffer if the application for extension of time was granted ] i was not in a position (financially or emotionally) to commence the district court proceedings earlier than august 2021 as a consequence of the relocation costs i incurred when relocating (deposed below), drought and floods on the [region x] of nsw between late 2016 and 2021 as deposed below. [13] our relationship ended many years ago. i understand that [mr haigh] and i each moved on with our respective personal lives following our separation. i have lived in 5 different properties in the last 7 years. i have been unable to locate many of my financial records and documents and those stored in boxes were destroyed in the 2021 floods on the [region x] of nsw. [19] i have retained an accountant to assist me prepare my personal income tax returns and trust statements for the [o] testamentary trust (of which i am the sole trustee) from 2009 to the present time. my accountant requires me to employ a bookkeeper to assist inputting my accounting data into xero software. given the limited funds available to me, i have not been in a position to employ a bookkeeper at the present time. [20] once i have completed and lodged my personal tax returns i expect to have a substantial amount due and owing to the ato for my personal income tax. i am unable to estimate this at this stage.
