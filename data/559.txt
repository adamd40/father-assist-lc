legal principles  whether the court is satisfied that hardship would be caused to the applicant or a child if leave were not granted, and (b) whether in the exercise of discretion the court should grant or refuse leave.   whether in the exercise of discretion the court should grant or refuse leave.
“in ordinary parlance, hardship means something more burdensome than “any appreciable detriment”. we consider that in subsec. 44(4) the word should have its usual, though not necessarily its most stringent, connotations. it is impossible to lay down in advance what particular facts may or may not amount to hardship in the relevant sense. as a general proposition it might be said that, the inability of an applicant to pursue a claim which in the circumstances of the applicant or a child of the marriage is trifling, generally will not cause hardship. similarly, where the costs which the applicant will have to bear himself or herself are about as much or more than what the applicant is likely to be awarded on a property claim, ordinarily hardship would not result if leave to institute proceedings were not granted. but otherwise we find no warrant in either subsec. 44(3) or 44(4) for saying that the right or entitlement lost must be a substantial one... hardship may be caused to an applicant if leave were not granted to institute proceedings, although the applicant is not in necessitous circumstances. whatever the financial situation of an applicant may be, his or her loss of a prospective entitlement to property including money, or his or her inability to have the financial and property relations of the parties adjusted or resolved may constitute hardship...”
“the determination how this discretion should be exercised, must depend on the facts of the particular case. due weight must be given to the expressed legislation intendment that ordinarily, proceedings should be commenced within a year from a date of the decree nisi, and the general policy of the act which appears from s.44(3) and s.81 that financial relationships between the spouses should, wherever possible be brought to finality within a reasonable time after the dissolution of marriage. hence, such matters as the length of the delay, the reasons for the delay and prejudice occasioned to the respondent by reason of the delay, and the strength on the merits of the applicant’s case, and the degree of the hardship which would be suffered unless leave were granted, are matters affecting the exercise of the discretion. these matters are not necessarily the only ones. on the other hand, ss.44(3) and 44(4) point to the conclusion that the legislature intended to confer power on the court to grant leave to institute proceedings in order to avoid hardship. having regard to the nature of jurisdiction which this court exercises, this power should be exercised liberally in order to avoid hardship, but nevertheless in a manner, which would not render nugatory the requirement that proceedings should be instituted within a year from the decree nisi.”
has the application been filed out of time?
has the applicant demonstrated that she will suffer hardship if deprived of the chance to bring her property claim?
“... the general principle is that on the issue of the establishment of prima facie case the court proceeds on the basis that the evidence of the applicant, unless it is inherently unbelievable or contradictory, should be accepted, and the court should therefore decide whether or not on that basis a prima facie case has been made out. if leave is granted, then it is for the court conducting the ultimate hearing to determine whether that prima facie case can be established.”
“ 18. in beecham group ltd v bristol laboratories pty ltd (1968) 118 clr 618 at 622-623, the high court of australia said that, for the purposes of an interlocutory application in which it is necessary for an applicant to demonstrate a prima facie case:
the first [inquiry] is whether the [applicant] has made out of time a prima facie case, in the sense that if the evidence remains as it is there is a probability that at the trial of the action the [applicant] will be held entitled to relief. how strong the probability needs to be depends, no doubt, upon the nature of the rights the [applicant] asserts and the practical consequences likely to flow from the order the [applicant] seeks.”
19. the full court has previously affirmed that the principle binds the determination of interlocutory applications under s 44 of the act (edmunds & edmunds at [19]-[20]). 20. in australian broadcasting commission v o’neill [2006] hca 46, (2006) 227 clr 57 (at [65] and [69]), the high court of australia said this to explicate the test established in beecham:
65. ... by using the phrase “prima facie case”, their honours did not mean that the [applicant] must show that it is more probable than not that at trial the [applicant] will succeed, it is sufficient that the [applicant] show a sufficient likelihood of success to justify [the interlocutory relief]. ... 69. ... it [is] not necessary for the [applicant] to show that it [is] more probable than not that the [applicant] [will] succeed at trial.”
does the applicant’s case show a sufficient likelihood of success
“ in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4)”.

prejudice to the respondent by reason of the delay
“merely because the respondent to an application for leave does not point to particular prejudice that might arise if leave were granted, does not dispose of the question. the law presumes prejudice to flow to a person sought to be joined in litigation after the effluxion of the relevant time limits. even if the court came to the view that there was no significant prejudice to the respondent, the court may consider whether in all of the circumstances of the case, it is just and reasonable to grant the extension sought.”[33]
