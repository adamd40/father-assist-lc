property proceedings under pt viii and the approach in hickey and stanford  identify the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, liabilities, and financial resources at the time of trial, and then determine whether it is just and equitable to adjust their interests pursuant to s 79(1),[46] (2) consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)–(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[47] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[48]   consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)–(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[47] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[48]   consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[47] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[48]   ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[48]
section 79(8) — additional considerations and notes on jurisdiction  it would have made an order with respect to property if the deceased party had not died, and (ii) it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property,  ) it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property,
... what can be enforced after the death of one of the parties is a right arising out of the marital relationship [and] that right may survive the marital relationship from which it has sprung.[51]
any incidental proceedings [including] a proceeding which falls within para (f) of the definition [of matrimonial cause] where the appropriate relationship exists.[52]
section 79(8) does not confer jurisdiction on the family court to entertain proceedings commenced after the death of one of the parties to the marriage. the proceedings to which it relates are proceedings commenced between the parties to a marriage with respect to the property of those parties or either of them arising out of the marital relationship or otherwise falling within par (ca) of the definition of ‘matrimonial cause’ in s 4(1) of the act. the proceedings must have been a matrimonial cause commenced pursuant to s 79(1). the death of a spouse will not always extinguish or satisfy the moral claims of the surviving spouse and children to which effect would have been given if the proceedings had been completed. section 79(8) empowers the family court to give effect to the moral claims made in respect of the property of the spouses which was made available to answer those claims by the commencement of the proceedings, provided ‘it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property’: s 79(8)(b)(ii). that qualification on the power, coupled with par (ca)(i) of the definition of ‘matrimonial cause’, ensure that the jurisdiction is exercised only in cases where the moral obligations arising out of the marriage remain unsatisfied. section 79(8) provides machinery for the discharge of those moral obligations in priority to any rights in the property of a party to a marriage which arise by testamentary disposition of that party's property or by any other devolution of that property on that party's death. that is a law which governs an incident of marriage in that it provides the machinery for enforcing the moral obligations with respect to property arising from a spouse's marital relationship. it is a law with respect to marriage.[55]  elf-evidently, [s 39(5)(a)] brings within the jurisdiction of the court disputes which, in their own right are matters arising under the act, provided they are matters in respect of which matrimonial causes are instituted.[61]
must be taken to refer to the process of litigation which will result in an adjustment of the interests of each of the parties in relation to the whole of their property which is just and equitable in the circumstances.[67]
section 79(8)(b)(i) and (ii) — would the court have made an order, and is it still appropriate to do so?
qualitatively describes a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations and cannot be exhaustively defined.[70]
the act itself ... apparently leaves the matter entirely to the discretion of the court. the criteria for the exercise of that discretion, namely that it is ‘appropriate’, is the same as that for the exercise of the discretion, under s 79(1), to make an order between living spouses or former spouses. furthermore, s 79(2), which provides that the court shall not make an order ‘under this section’ unless it is satisfied that it is ‘just and equitable’ to make the order, also applies, since s 79(8) is part of ‘this section’. likewise, it would seem that s 79(4), which provides that in considering what order (if any) should be made ‘under this section’, the court shall take into account the various matters referred to in paras (a) to (f) thereof inclusive, must also apply. however, as some of those matters, particularly many of the matters referred to in s 75(2) which are brought into account by s 79(4)(e), are apt to refer only to parties who are living, it is very difficult to apply them in a case where one of the parties is dead. this much is therefore clear, that the intention of the legislature was that the discretion of the court under s 79(8) should be no more fettered than its discretion under s 79(1) which, as gibbs cj said in mallet v mallet (1984) 9 fam lr 449 at 451, [1984] flc 91–507 at 79,111 , is ‘largely unfettered’. when the legislature gives the court an unfettered discretion, the court should not seek to limit that discretion by imposing upon itself rules for the exercise of it. all that the court is required to do in exercising the discretion is to act judicially, and not arbitrarily or capriciously.[77]
by reference to the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, is it just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79?
section 79(4)(a)–(c) — contributions
section 79(4)(a) — direct financial contributions
all contributions must be weighed collectively and so it is an error to segment or compartmentalise the various contributions and weigh one against the remainder.[95]  hen [a] marriage ends, especially where that marriage has been a long one, one cannot separate the parties as individuals from the people they became in the context of the marriage relationship, and the allocation of roles, duties and responsibilities which it entailed.[101]
section 79(4)(b) — direct and indirect non-financial contributions to property
section 79(4)(c) — contributions to the welfare of the family, including contributions as homemaker or parent
conclusion regarding the parties’ contributions
section 79(4)(d)–(g), including s 75(2) — other factors
section 79(4)(d) — the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the marriage
section 79(4)(e) — the matters referred to in subsection 75(2) so far as they are relevant
section 75(2)(a) — the age and state of health of each of the parties t is the financial consequences of all of the relevant matters that are to be taken into account and the section is so drafted to effect this purpose while excluding matters of conduct in a moral or non-financial sense.[108]
section 75(2)(b) — the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment
section 75(2)(d) — commitments of each of the parties necessary to enable them to support themselves and a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain
section 75(2)(g) — a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable
... there are almost invariably post-separation inadequate resources available to maintain two households in the manner to which one household has become accustomed. none the less the words of fogarty j in gamble & gamble (1978) flc 90–452 ... may well be appropriate in determining what the meaning of sec 75(2)(g) is. his honour there said:
“the magistrate was entitled to have regard to the reasonably high standard of living at which the parties had lived prior to separation. although the actual evidence of this was relatively scanty, it is nevertheless i think clear from the whole of the evidence. in my view it is a matter which the court is clearly entitled and indeed obliged to take into account in assessing maintenance under sec 72. section 75(2)(g) required the court to take into account ‘where the parties have separated or the marriage has been dissolved, a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable.’ that does not necessarily mean the standard of living to which the parties were accustomed during the time that they were living together, since, as mr abraham pointed out, obviously a situation where there are now two households rather than one, makes it in most cases, impossible to sustain the previously existing standard of living in both of those new households, and, in any event there may be other reasons why this is so. but within that limitation it is in my view significant to have regard to what the act refers to as a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable. in this case, as in many others, attention is generally focused on the question of ‘need’ under sec 72. it seems sometimes to be thought that there is some absolute level beyond which an applicant's need would not go, that is that once it is shown that his or her income from other sources has reached some designated level that there would no longer be any ‘need’ for maintenance under sec 72. whilst that may be broadly true of what might be described as the general run of cases, the measure of need is a variable factor which must take into account a variety of circumstances, not the least of which is the appropriate standard of living of the parties. where the capacity of the husband is such that he is able to provide maintenance for the wife at a level which enables both of them to continue to enjoy a standard of living equivalent to that which they enjoyed for some time prior to the separation or which enables the wife to enjoy a standard of living which may be higher than the average in the community it may be proper to make an order which broadly achieves that result, ...”
the question that confronted the court in this case was whether it was proper to effect a reduction in the standard of living of the wife pending the disposal of the proceedings where there were more than ample funds to sustain that standard of living without the slightest hardship to the husband, irrespective of how extravagant the standard of living may have been compared to the standard of living of other members of the community. in particular, is it proper to reduce the wife's standard of living whilst the husband continues to maintain a standard of living of the highest order?[111]
section 75(2)(n) — the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 79 in relation to the property of the parties
section 79(4)(f) — any order made under this act affecting a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage
section 79(4)(g) — any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the marriage has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the marriage
conclusion regarding the matters referred to in s 79(4)(d)–(g)
final assessment: a just and equitable exercise of discretion?
... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[113]

[1] the date of separation given by the wife’s affidavit is 21 may 2019 and that given by the husband’s affidavit is 23 february 2020. this makes for a difference of nine months in the context of a 35-year marriage — the wife’s affidavit gives a duration of 35 years and 7 months, and the husband’s affidavit gives a duration of 36 years and 4 months. the husband ultimately conceded under cross-examination that separation occurred when he moved into the c care centre aged care residence in may 2019.[2] order of judge newbrun dated 27 october 2021; family law act 1975 (cth) s 79(8). mr kerrison, on behalf of the wife, relied upon the affidavit of mr holland filed 29 september 2021 to again establish the wife’s death and the grant of probate, noting that this affidavit would have been before his honour for the purposes of the substitution order of 27 october 2021.[3] ibid ss 79(1a), 79(8)(c).[4] those interim orders also include, by consent, an indemnification by each party to the other with respect to liabilities incurred in their name or attaching to property to which the other is entitled, an order under s 106a of the act, and a costs order against the wife’s solicitor to pay the husband’s solicitor a sum of $3,650.00.[5] cba pensioner security account no. ...29 (exhibit j1, item 4) and cba term deposit account no. ...65 (exhibit j1, item 5). i note that the latter account number is shown in exhibit j1 as 5017 3765 but annex 8 to the wife’s affidavit indicates that the correct account number is ...65. the asset pool, extracted at paragraph 19 herein, therefore refers to the account as ...65.[6] affidavit, ms jensen, 24 may 2021 (‘affidavit (wife)’), [56].[7] now represented by the $304,310.18 held in the husband’s solicitor’s trust account.[8] the husband stated this in cross-examination to clarify that he did not require a loan from the wife (purportedly of $6,000.00) to pay out his sister’s half-interest, although as found at 74 of these reasons, the husband conceded that the wife contributed that amount to the mortgage on the suburb m property.[9] the husband agreed under cross-examination that the parties lived at the suburb ab property for a time in 1983.[10] affidavit (wife) (n 6) [35].[11] affidavit, mr jensen, 4 march 2021 (‘affidavit (husband)’), [13]–[16]; affidavit (wife) (n 6) [31]. the husband says that the wife retired in 1985, after the suburb ae home had been built, but the wife’s affidavit states that she retired in 1984.[12] affidavit (wife) (n 6) [35]–[36], [45], together with documents titled ‘cash withdrawals’ and ‘post office transactions’.[13] parshen & parshen (1996) flc 92-720, 83,665;
