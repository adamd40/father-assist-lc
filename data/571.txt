the forum issue
applicable legal principles
in cases such as the present, where different issues are involved in the local and foreign proceedings, albeit that the different proceedings arise out of the same sub-stratum of fact, the question is not whether the australian court is a clearly inappropriate forum for the litigation of the issues involved in the australian proceedings. rather, the question must be whether, having regard to the controversy as a whole, the australian proceedings are vexatious or oppressive in the voth sense of those terms, namely, that they are “productive of serious and unjustified trouble and harassment” or “seriously and unfairly burdensome, prejudicial or damaging”. (footnote omitted)

consideration
the period of separation
when it is asserted that a separation has taken place it may be necessary to examine and contrast the state of the marital relationship before and after the alleged separation. whether there has been a separation will be a question of fact to be determined in each case.
separation can only occur in the sense used by the act where one or both of the spouses form an intention to sever or not to resume the marital relationship and act upon that intention, or alternatively act as if the marital relationship has been severed.
