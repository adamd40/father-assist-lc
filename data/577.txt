the law.  if, in proceedings under this act, the court is of opinion that there are circumstances that justify it in doing so, the court may, subject to subsections (2a), (4), (4a), (5) and (6) in the applicable rules of court, make such order as to costs and security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, as the court considers just.  ) in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2), the court shall have regard to:   the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, (b) whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle proceedings in the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.
it is an accurate description of s. 117 (1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the sub-section is not paramount to s. 117 (2). as sub-s. (1) is expressed to be subject to sub-s. (2) the former must yield whenever a judge finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. sub-section (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the 2 provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs. consequently, with respect to their honours in the family court, we do not agree with the suggestion made in the judgement under appeal that an order can only be made under s. 117 (2) in “a clear case.   the ordinary position in proceedings under the family law act 1975 (cth) (the act) is that each party is to bear his or her own costs (s 117(1)). where the court is of the opinion that circumstances justify it in doing so, the court may make such order as to costs as it considers just (s 117(2)). thus, an order may be made for the payment of costs on an indemnity basis, although such orders are exceptional (in the marriage of l and c l kohan [1992] famca 116, (1992) 16 fam lr 245 at 259, (1993) flc 92-340 at 79,614, limousin v limousin (costs) (2007) 38 fam lr 478, [2007] famca 1178, d and d (costs) (no 2) (2010) flc 93-435, [2010] famcafc 64). [10] it is, however, a mistake to think that if a costs order is made, that order can only be on a party and party basis or on an indemnity basis. the words “such order as to costs ... as the court considers just” permit the court to fashion an (2019) 59 fam lr 419 [2019] famcafc 54 at 421 order that is apt to the circumstances. one such well-known example is assessment on a trustee basis, which is more generous than party and party costs, but falls short of an indemnity. orders for a partial indemnity or for a particular period are obvious possibilities. the court may also fix costs in a particular sum, taking account of all relevant circumstances, that type of order too is neither one for party and party costs nor an indemnity costs order. for convenience, in these reasons we shall refer to such orders as a “special costs order”. [11] decisions as to the appropriate basis for any costs order are, of course, guided by principle. in applications under s 117 of the act for costs of whatever kind, the court must have regard to the considerations set out in s 117(2a). paragraph (g) requires the court to take into account any relevant matter. [12] as the decision in colgate-palmolive co v cussons pty ltd [1993] fca 536, (1993) 46 fcr 225 at 233–4, [1993] fca 536, 118 alr 248 at 256–7, [1993] fca 536, 28 ipr 561 at 569–70 (colgate-palmolive) and the extensive authorities referred to in it make clear, the categories for the making of special costs orders are not closed and may be made whenever the particular facts and circumstances warrant it. that position is reflected in s 117(2) of the act. [13] it is necessary to consider first whether there should be an order for costs before turning to whether the quantum of the costs should be left to the application of the scale contained within sch 3 of the rules or assessed or fixed on some other basis. ... [40] ... the court is not bound only to make an order on a party and party basis or on an indemnity basis. it may take an intermediate course if that is the order that is just in all of the circumstances. a special costs order may be assessed by reference to a particular period of time or set of events. alternatively, the court may fix a sum for costs that exceeds party and party costs but falls short of an indemnity.
we think that whilst s 117 (2a) does not provide any direct guidance to where weight should be given in any one particular case, it is very important for the court to give proper consideration to written offers of settlement that have been made. the insertion of s 117c into the legislation is a clear indication of the desire of parliament to enable parties to avoid unnecessary litigation by indicating to the other party an appropriate basis upon which litigation can be settled. the failure to heed a reasonable offer in circumstances where there is adequate knowledge of the parties at the time the offer is made to give it proper consideration, is something to which very significant weight indeed normally to be given ...
12.13 order for costs (1) the court may make an order for costs on its own initiative. (2) a party may apply for an order that another person pay costs. (3) an application for costs may be made:   at any stage during a proceeding, or (b) by filing an application in a proceeding within 28 days after the final order is made.   a party applying for an order for costs on an indemnity basis must inform the court if the party is bound by a costs agreement or costs agreements in relation to those costs and, if so, the terms of the costs agreement or costs agreements. (5) in making an order for costs in a proceeding, the court may set a time for payment of the costs, which may be before the proceeding is concluded.
12.17 method of calculation of costs (1) the court may order that a party is entitled to costs:   of a specific amount, or (b) as assessed on a particular basis (for example, party and party, solicitor and client or indemnity), or (c) to be calculated in accordance with the method stated in the order, or (d) for part of the proceeding, or part of an amount, assessed in accordance with schedule 3.   if costs are payable under the family law act or these rules, or the court orders that costs be paid and does not specify the method for their calculation, the costs are to be assessed on a party and party basis. (3) in making an order under subrule (1), the court may consider the following:   the importance, complexity or difficulty of the issues, (b) the reasonableness of each party’s behaviour in the proceeding including by having regard to the matters set out in subrule 12.08(2), (c) the rates ordinarily payable to lawyers in comparable proceedings, (d) whether a lawyer’s conduct has been improper, unfair, unreasonable or disproportionate, (e) the time properly spent on the proceeding, or in complying with pre‑action procedures, (f) whether expenses (paid or payable) are fair, reasonable and proportionate.
12.18 maximum amount of party and party costs recoverable (1) this rule sets out the maximum amount of party and party costs a person may recover:   if the court orders that costs are to be paid and does not fix the amount by means of a maximum costs order made under rule 12.10 or otherwise, and (b) if a person is entitled to costs under these rules.   the maximum amount of costs that a person may recover under this rule is as follows:   for fees—an amount calculated in accordance with schedules 2 and 3, (b) for an expense referred to in schedule 2 (other than item 101 of part 1)—the amount specified in that schedule for that expense, (c) for any other expenses—a reasonable amount.
12.19 interest on outstanding costs interest is payable on outstanding costs at the rate referred to in rule 10.17.
4.01 costs in family law and child support matters (1) in applying chapter 12 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 in relation to family law or child support proceedings, the court may apply the scale of costs in schedule 3 to those rules or the scale of costs in schedule 1 to these rules. (2) in item 12 of the table in schedule 1 to these rules:   the reference to rule 11.15 is a reference to rule 11.15 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 as that rule applies because of rule 2.01 of these rules, and (b) the reference to rule 11.34 is a reference to rule 11.34 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 as that rule applies because of rule 2.01 of these rules.   where it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where a party properly advised should have known that he had no chance of success. in such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts (see fountain selected meats (sales) pty. ltd. v. international produce merchants pty. ltd. [1988] 81 alr 397, (b) making allegations of fraud, knowing them to be false, and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud (see fountain selected meats (sales) pty. ltd. (supra), (c) evidence of particular misconduct causing loss of time to the court and to other parties (see tetijo holdings pty. ltd. v keeprite australia pty. ltd (unreported, federal court, 3 may 1991)). 2015] famcafc 157 reasons page 7 (d) the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (see ragatta developments pty. ltd. v westpac banking corporation (unreported federal court, 5 march 1993)). (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.  ] indemnity cost orders are made only in exceptional cases (kohan and kohan [1992] famca 116, (1993) flc 92-340, limousin v limousin (costs) [2007] famca 1178, (2007) 38 fam lr 478, d & d (costs) (no. 2) (2010) flc 93-435). [36] whilst the categories of cases in which indemnity cost orders may be awarded are not closed, it is accepted that such costs may be ordered where a case was pursued with “wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law” and where there has been “an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise” (colgate palmolive co v cussons pty ltd [1993] fca 536, (1993) 46 fcr 225 at 233). [37] in relation to the first category, it has been said that indemnity costs may be awarded where “the applicant, properly advised, should have known that he had no chance of success” (fountain selected meats (sales) pty ltd v international produce merchants pty ltd (1988) 81 alr 397 at 401) and where “a party persists in what should on proper consideration be seen to be a hopeless case” (j-corp pty ltd v australian builders labourers federation union of workers – western australian branch & anor [1993] fca 70 per french j at 5).
... failure to accept an offer which in retrospect should have been accepted does not necessarily justify an order for costs on an indemnity basis.
consideration.
... the agreed position was that the matter was to be dealt with conveniently by way of short oral submissions at the hearing date 19/11/20. on the hearing date the respondent through his barrister made an application for adjournment and in our submission was not made with the best interests of the children in mind. he adjournment was not agreed to by the applicant.
... properly advised, should have known that he had no chance of success and above all should not have prolonged the matter by seeking an adjournment on the listed hearing date. the respondent persisted in this matter in what should on proper consideration be seen to be a hopeless case.
... do not appear to have a connection with the orders made on 5 july 2021 and even if they do the court would with respect have difficulties making an order for costs in respect of those attendances.
... the court found favour of the mother’s application and/or the father was wholly unsuccessful.
