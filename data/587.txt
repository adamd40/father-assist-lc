reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background   aged 12 years in in year 6 at [c school]. she is a tall, good looking and well-built girl, who looks older than her age. [x] was open and articulate and she engaged well in interview. there was no sense that she had been coached or influenced by either party, but rather that she was endeavouring to provide a genuine account of her lived experience in each household, but especially in her father’s. [x]’s understanding of the purpose of today’s interview was in terms of “dad wants me to live there again...but i don’t want to go back...if i’m forced to go back, i’ve told people i will run away...i’m unhappy there...i’ve been unhappy there for a long time”. [x] acknowledged having had a ‘fairly good’ relationship with her father until november or december 2019 when “dad found out i had social media and i hadn’t told him”. she said that thereafter, this continued to be a source of conflict between them and there were times when her father would not talk to her other than to say “dinners ready”, sometimes for up to four days. [x] recalled spending most of the last christmas holidays with her mother...i didn’t want to go back to dad’s...it’s the same thing over and over again” [beginning to cry at this point] [x] further described how the father had expected her to do “all the cleaning and washing” from early 2019, supposedly for her to earn pocket money, but in reality, she said that her father only rarely if ever paid her $10 for her work, “if i added up how much he owed me for cleaning it would be in the thousands of dollars”. [x] added that her father would make threats to her about not taking her to [dance classes] “if i didn’t clean my room... he’d say, you won’t go to [dance classes] or you won’t see your mum.” [x] listed the cleaning tasks as, “wash dishes...clean kitchen... dining room...bathroom...washing and folding. she added, [mr d] [one of the father’s two male housemates] used to say stop or take me into the city”. questioned in relation to concerns raised by the father about sexually explicit images on her computer, [x] shook her head and sighed, clearly frustrated to hear her father’s claims in this regard. she said, “i don’t know where he’s got that from...it’s just not true...there were no photos...all i had were [dance] [[dance classes]] poses...photos of me and my mum...my friends...my uncle”. she added, “i had an old computer then mum and dad went halves and got me a new computer but dad has locked it...we can’t unlock it”. she added, “dad’s called the police saying mum’s stolen it...now he’s blaming me for having stuff on it...it’s always someone else’s fault”. [x] believed that her father had gone onto icloud and locked the computer than reported it stolen...it’s not stolen...it’s with me but it can’t be opened...it can’t be unlocked...the computer has been disabled”. she added, “i’m not running away from the social media stuff...in my mind that’s sorted...i’m not wanting to go back because he hit me and i’m scared he’ll me again”. when reference was made to the incident/argument with her father that precipitated her staying with her mother rather than return to her father, [x] said, “we were arguing again about me being on social media...the same old argument we had been having since last year...that i kept it from him...that it was unsafe...over and over again the same thing...a normal parent would just talk about it but it went on for six months...he wouldn’t get over it [[x] began to cry at this point as she relived the incident in march 2020]” [x] then recounted, “we were sitting down at the table and he hit me... with an open hand...it hurt...the first and only time he’s hit me...i screamed and [mr e] [one of the father’s housemates] came in saying, “don’t tell me you hit her” and dad said something like, ‘she’s lucky i didn’t knock her block off’...then [mr d] [the other housemate] ran out of the bathroom...he didn’t see anything but he heard me scream”. [x] recalled calling her mother on her way to school the next day, still very upset (“i was crying”) and asking her mother to collect her. her mother then met her at the bus stop and had wanted to take her to the police straight away, but [x] said she wanted to go to school instead. she added, “i spoke to my house leader...he took me to my old school counsellor...then the police visited me...asked me what happened...then a sergeant came and interviewed me twice...dad initially admitted he hit me then he started denying it...the sergeant asked if i wanted to go through with charging him...i said no...i was scared if i was sent back to him he would do it again”. she added, “the sergeant said it can be opened up at any time at all if i want”. [x] said that her preference would be not to be forced to see her father, “if i had my way i wouldn’t see him unless it’s father’s day or his birthday...no more overnight time...only daytime visits...i don’t really want to but this is only if i had to...” [x] then reported that her friends had been telling her that they always knew when she was staying with her mother “because i was so happy...since i’ve been with mum they say i’m looking so happy all the time...i’ve had multiple people telling me this all the time”. [x] added, “me and mum have such a fun to together...i see mum’s friends...my auntie my cousins”. by contrast, [x] said that she does not see or speak to her father’s family. she said that although her father has a son, 23-year old [mr f], “my half brother...he broke up with [mr f]’s mum when [mr f] was about ten...dad hardly ever sees [mr f]...the last time i saw [mr f] was on my10th birthday two years ago...the time before that was when i was 3 years old”. [x] added that her father does not seem to have relationships with his family, “his dad died ages ago and he hasn’t seen his mum for ages...and he hardly sees [mr f]”. [x] then spoke of feeling lonely and isolated at her father’s, being the only female in the house. she recalled her father having had a girlfriend for about a month in 2019 and that she relished having another female around, albeit only momentarily, “but he can’t keep a relationship with anyone”. [x] added, “i can’t talk to anyone about girl stuff like my period...i got it about 6 months ago”. [x] seemed surprised to be asked if she talked to her father about her boyfriend(s). she said she does not have a boyfriend, adding, “maybe in year 2 i did”. when reference was made to her school, [c school], [x] said that she had made some good friends, “and i do really well in my subjects”. [x] was aware that her father paid for her schooling before adding, “mum’s tried to pay but her name is not on the enrolment form...she’s got the money”. [x] further added, “dad’s come to the school last term to give me money but the school wouldn’t let him come in and see me” which she said, made her feel that school is a safe place for her. asked how she usually spent christmas when with her father, [x] said that the father’s housemates, “one goes to tasmania and the other goes to a country area” so it is usually just her and her father, “we don’t go anywhere...we don’t see anyone”. [x] said that she now does not feel safe alone with her father, since he has hit her. asked if she could think of anyone who could accompany her if she was to spend time with her father, [x] replied, “i don’t know...dad doesn’t like any of mum’s friends or family...he says he’s going to bash them all”. [x] concluded by rating herself “9 out of 10 happy” (with 10 out of 10 being happiest). she added, “i’m really happy at mum’s but this whole thing with dad is dragging me down by 1%...otherwise i would be 100% out of 10 happy”.[3]
the previous proceedings
the proceedings of september 2015  h] also observed [x] to be comfortable in her interactions with [ms trower] and [mr j], both of whom were described as being attentive towards [x]. overall, [ms h] observed the child to be more confident and self-assured, with her mother, than with her father. in interview, [x] did not seem to [ms h] to be entirely spontaneous. this was particularly so in respect of her indication that she did not wish to spend time with her father, which to [ms h]’s ear seemed to be a view which was rehearsed rather than spontaneous. it was also [ms h]’s view that [x] was likely to have been exposed to parental conflict, in the past. interestingly, [x] spoke positively of spending overnight time, with her father, in june/july and september/october of 2014, which coincided with the thawing of relations between the parties. in her evaluation of the family, [ms h] did not consider that [mr kirwan] was likely to pose a physical risk to [x]. she reached this view because of the tension between the mother’s reported fear of [mr kirwan] and her apparent willingness to allow him to spend extended periods of time, with [x], when it suited her. in this context, [ms h] also noted a lack of collateral evidence to support [ms trower]’s claims. overall, [ms h] was much more concerned about the potential danger posed to [x], arising from her parents’ drug use. in particular, she was concerned about the risk of [mr kirwan] using illicit substances as a means of self-medicating his depression, given what she understood of his prior psychiatric history, which she had obtained from contacting [dr k]. [ms h] considered that [ms trower] presented with some understanding of [x]’s developmental needs. however, her decision to keep the child from school, on wednesday afternoons, to avoid her spending time with her father was seen as evidence of a compromised parenting capacity for two major reasons. firstly, it was not helpful for [x] to have her routine and school attendances so disrupted, secondly, exposure to such an avoidance mechanism for the solving of problems was not seen as good role modelling for the child. [ms h] described [mr kirwan] as being cognisant of his own personal challenges and issues, relating to his previous mental health problems and drug use. she also considered that [mr kirwan] was likely to be a positive influence in [x]’s life because of his unconditional love for her, which was likely to lead to [x] having a sense of security and stability in her life. given these factors, [ms h] considered that it would be in [x]’s best interests, if she was able to maintain a meaningful level of relationship with her father through spending substantial time with him. [ms h], for obvious reasons, assessed the parties’ parenting relationship as one marked by significant conflict. i agree with that assessment. it was her view that [x] was acutely aware of the conflict between her parents. in this context, [ms h] recommended that, if at all possible, all handovers of [x] be structured to avoid the parties coming into direct contact with one another. given the level of conflict between [mr kirwan] and [ms trower], [ms h] was not in favour of an equal time arrangement, as she considered it would place an unacceptable level of psychological strain upon [x]. she also considered that the parties had no effective mechanisms to communicate with one another. it was also [ms h]’s view that, given the mother’s lack of compliance with previous court orders and her likely propensity not to support [x]’s relationship with her father, it was essential that [x] spend substantial and significant time with her father to address the risk of child and father being alienated from one another.[6]
in spite of [mr kirwan]’s clear commitment towards [x]’s best interests, his ability to wholly support [x]’s relationship with [ms trower] is questionable. this is unsurprising given the trauma of the dog attack not only for the child but also the parents. it is unsurprising that [mr kirwan] has lost further trust in [ms trower]’s ability to ensure [x]’s care and protection. [x] has indicated that [mr kirwan] has discussed with her, [ms trower]’s tendency to be dishonest, and thus it appears that [x] has likely been exposed to [mr kirwan]’s negative view of the mother. however, the child’s reported lack of trust in [ms trower] appears to also have been informed by her own observations of [ms trower]’s alleged tendency to be dishonest, to create fabrications that serve her own interests and at times her unreliability in terms of ‘keeping her promises’ to the child. the dog attack was an accident. there is nothing in [x]’s account of the incident to suggest that [ms trower] or [mr j] intentionally placed the child at significant risk of harm. nonetheless, the incident highlighted a lack of adequate parental supervision to ensure [x]’s safety and echoes a possible concern that [ms trower] will at times compromise upholding [x]’s best interests in favour of appeasing [mr j]’s wishes and opinion. [x]’s disclosures suggest that in spite of the critical incident in july 2016, her own misgivings about [ms trower] and her likely exposure to parental conflict, and paternal influence, there remains a significant attachment between the child and mother and ultimately, that the child wishes to continue to send significant and substantial time with [ms trower]. congruent with [x]’s age and stage of development, she was unable to confidently quantify how much time she would like to spend with [ms trower], other than she would like for this to include overnight periods at regular intervals.[8]
more recent events
throughout the department’s current home visits, and additional text messages and phone calls, [mr kirwan] has raised a number of concerns relating to [ms trower] and historical events related to her parenting of [x]. apart from events in november relating to the cannabis cultivation in [ms trower]’s home, [mr kirwan] was unable to provide any current information relating to [ms trower] and her ability to provide care, only that he feels her past behaviour and inability to prioritise [x] is likely continuing. [mr kirwan] was disparaging of [ms trower] and was often focused on her behaviour, rather than his own or on [x].[11]   advised the department that she was currently residing with [ms trower] and that there is no one else residing in the home. the department is aware that concerns had been raised that [ms trower] had reconciled with her former partner, [mr j], however [x] confirmed that [ms trower] was not currently in a relationship and had not been in one for a number of years. [x] advised the department that she had been residing with [ms trower] full time since march 2020, that she thinks "it's great" living with [ms trower] and [x] enjoys spending time with her. [x] described having a close relationship with [ms trower] and described [ms trower] as "a good person". [x] discussed engaging in [dance classes] with [ms trower] and other dancing groups, [x] spoke about these activities and her relationship with [ms trower] with a smile and appeared genuine in her expressions about enjoying spending time with [ms trower]. it was apparent through conversations with [x], as well as information from the school, that [x] has a close and positive relationship with [ms trower]. [x] did not express having any worries about living with [ms trower] and that she had not ever felt unsafe residing in her care. [x] clearly expressed wanting to remain living with [ms trower] full time.[12]   reported to departmental workers that she had told a number of people that she does not want to have any contact with [mr kirwan] at this point in time. [x] expressed that she had stopped wanting to see [mr kirwan] after he had "hit" her in march 2020. [x] discussed that [mr kirwan] had physically harmed her on this occasion after he had found "some things" on her social media and "wouldn't let it go", became angry at her and slapped her across the face. the department has information that [x] has expressed [mr kirwan] took her shopping after the incident and had "acted like nothing had happened". [x] reported to departmental workers that she also did not want to speak to [mr kirwan] at this current time as [mr kirwan] was always saying "awful" things about [ms trower]. [x] expressed that [ms trower] is a "good person" and that she no longer wanted to listen to [mr kirwan] say such things about [ms trower]. [x] discussed with the department that if she did not have a choice and had to spend time with [mr kirwan], she would prefer to see him every fortnight rather than every week, as the court orders currently stipulate. the department is aware that [x] has refused to attend visitation with [mr kirwan] for a number of weeks, and has also chosen not to speak with [mr kirwan] via phone.[13]
the department is concerned that [mr kirwan] focused on historical events through discussions with the department and trying to prove that [ms trower] was not fit to provide care to [x]. [mr kirwan] was unable to reflect on his own behaviours and it is of concern that this may indicate limited capacity for insight in to [x]'s needs and ultimately changing his behaviours to meet her needs. whilst there is concern for [mr kirwan’s] controlling nature, the department does not have any evidence at this time to suggest that [mr kirwan’s] poses an immediate safety risk to [x]. nonetheless, [x] has expressed clear views to a number of people that she does not currently wish to have any contact with [mr kirwan], which has also been evident in her refusal to attend contact over the last few weeks. the department considers that [x] and [mr kirwan's] relationship is currently fractured, and should contact orders be made, [mr kirwan] and [x] will require support to build and repair their relationship gradually. [x] is almost thirteen years of age and it is important that her views and wishes are considered when making decisions around care arrangements and time spending to ensure her emotional and psychological wellbeing.[14]
the writer asked [x] if she would be prepared to work towards seeing her father and spending time with him. [x] was direct in her answer. she said, "no." the writer asked her why she does not want to see her father and spend time with him. [x] replied, "when i was seeing him on sundays the last few times he was yelling at me that it was all my fault." the writer asked the girl what her father meant by this. [x] shrugged and said, "everything." the writer asked [x] what had happened prior to the incident in which she claims her father hit her. [x] explained, "it was a social media drama, he found out that i had instagram." [x] said that her father had got angry with her and was shouting at her about this. [x] had some news for the writer. she said, "he kept me from school for sixteen weeks." the writer asked the girl when [mr kirwan] had done this. [x] replied, "when i was eight or nine." the writer asked [x] why her father had done this. [x] explained, "he didn't want me to see mum." the writer asked [x] how she would describe her father. [x] answered, "he is a control freak and he has to be in control of everything." the writer asked [x] if [mr kirwan] has always been like this. [x] explained, "slowly over the years he has got worse and worse" [x] remains upset and angry regarding the incident in which she claims that [mr kirwan] hit her. she said, "i could have knocked [me] on a table or got hit worse. he is a big man." [x] said that she is afraid of her father. the writer told [x] that he had heard that [x] had taken nude film of herself and that her father had found this. [x] denied that she had taken nude film of herself. [x] said that she had taken film of herself learning a back flip with one of her coaches. [x] said that she had been fully clothed in the film. the writer asked [x] if she misses her father. [x] answered, "i miss the old him not the new him, the aggressive him".[15]
the issues in this case remain complex. unfortunately there are very few courses of action available given the opposition from [x] and her mother. if the primary issue is to be [x]'s safety then this would require a family assessment. the alliance between [x] and her mother has completely degraded any judgement [x] can make at present about where her own best interests lie. at the present time [x] is in the position of having a high degree of power with very little responsibility. the current dispute and the dynamics between [x] and her parents mean that [x], the least able of the three due to age and immaturity, is the main driver of what is happening. this is a very dangerous position for this young woman to find herself in. she has already demonstrated her poor judgement by going to live with her mother. at this time [x]'s judgement is verging on being self-destructive.[17]
the child remained adamant that she wanted no relationship with her father whatsoever. when i spoke to the child about her father, she was very vocal about her thoughts and opinions. she told me that she had not seen him or had contact with him since we last met. she further told me that she does not want to see him at all. she does not want to speak to him on the phone or receive any cards or gifts. she has just had enough of it all and suspects he will run the proceedings through the court system until she is 18. the child said that she even dyed her hair blonde so the father would not recognise her. the child disclosed to me that if she has to spend time with him again, she will run away.[18]
the issue
legal considerations  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.
...the adversarial system has been qualified by changing practices in the courts directed to the reduction of costs and delay and the realisation that the courts are concerned not only with justice between the parties, which remains their priority, but also with the public interest in the proper and efficient use of public resources.[26]
specific considerations relating to summary judgment
the court may make a decree for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceedings if:   the first party is defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings, and (b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.   the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.  t is important to begin by recognising that the combined effect of sub-sections (2) & (3) is that the inquiry required in this case is whether there is a ‘reasonable’ prospect of prosecuting the proceeding, not an inquiry directed to whether a certain and concluded determination could be made that the proceedings would necessarily fail. in this respect section 31a departs radically from the basis upon which earlier forms of provision permitting the entry of summary judgment have been understood and administered.[35]   proceeding should not be dismissed summarily merely on the ground that it appears, at the early stage of the hearing of the motion brought for that purpose, to advance a highly implausible claim which will very probably fail, but only where the claim may properly be described as unarguable, and almost incontestably bad, or where the claim is otherwise objectionable as an abuse of the process of the court.[38]
an opinion of the court that a case appears weak and such that it is unlikely to succeed is not, alone, sufficient to warrant termination... even a weak case is entitled to the time of a court. experience teaches that the concentration of attention, elaborated evidence and argument and extended time for reflection will sometimes turn an apparently uncompromising cause into a successful judgment.[39]  he determination of a summary dismissal application therefore does not require a mini-trial based upon incomplete evidence to decide whether the proceedings are likely to succeed or fail at trial. instead, it requires a critical examination of the available materials to determine whether there is a real question of law or fact that should be decided at trial. each application for summary judgment or summary dismissal has to be determined according to its particular circumstances. what is required is a practical judgment of the case at hand. the relevant circumstances will partly depend upon the stage which the proceedings have reached. among other things, this will affect the materials available to the court considering the application, for example, whether pleadings have been exchanged, or discovery of documents has occurred.[43]
