family report ra 95) at times, during interview, [mr vasseur] seemed self-focussed as it would seem in part his priority is pursuing his career and this may have included him moving away from [x] to do so. this in turn provides limited capacity for [mr vasseur] to spend time with [x] on a regular basis. it may be that [mr vasseur] prioritising his career would help him develop financial security which may contribute to him being able to provide for [x’s] needs in the long term. however, the limited time that he has to spend with [x] will impact the quality of the relationship between them. additionally, some of his expectations regarding [x] spending long periods of time away from [ms gauss] particularly during infancy seemed more focused on his own needs rather than [x’s] at that time. (para 96) the impression given by [mr vasseur], despite his stated intentions, is that his role as parent is not in fact his priority, and this may be the result of the pregnancy continuing against [mr vasseur’s] stated wishes. his attitude and limited capacity to prioritise his role as [x’s] parent is not necessarily erroneous or negligent of him as it seems he has not overextended his ability to commit to spending time with [x], which will at least support his and [x’s] relationship, and, [ms gauss] seems able and willing to provide the bulk of [x’s] care. however, the mismatch between his stated intentions and his actions may cause conflict within the co-parenting relationship as it may that with time [mr vasseur] seeks a more significant involvement when it suits him, which may cause disruption to [x’s] and [ms gauss’] lives. (para 97) it would seem that [mr vasseur] has experienced pressure from the paternal grandparents to take responsibility and meet his obligations to [x], based on their assessment of what that should include. (para 98) [ms gauss] gave the impression of being child focussed in that she seems to have structured he life around [x’s] needs and given considerable thought as to how his relationships within his family can be supported. despite allegations made that she has not facilitated [x’s] relationship with [mr vasseur] it would appear that she has in fact been willing and able to encourage [x’s] relationship, which includes having (along with [mrs vasseur]) developed a functional relationship with [mrs vasseur] to enable [x] to spend time with his extended paternal family independently of [mr vasseur]. although it seems that at times [ms gauss] has had some trepidation for [x’s] wellbeing with [mr vasseur], and despite there being quite high levels of acrimony, she has facilitated [x’s] time with [mr vasseur] is some capacity since his birth. if the reports of [x’s] relationship with [mr vasseur] and his paternal grandparents are accurate, the quality of [x’s] relationships with [mr vasseur] and his paternal grandparents, is likely to have been strongly supported and encouraged by [ms gauss]. (para 99) although it seems that [ms gauss’] decision to proceed with the pregnancy, work towards co-parenting [x] with [mr vasseur] and establish a functional relationship with [mrs vasseur], for [x], may not have aligned with the maternal grandmother’s views, it would seem that [ms gauss] has been able to continue to prioritise [x’s] need to have a meaningful relationships with his paternal family. this again is likely to be of credit to [ms gauss] capacity as a parent and her ability to prioritise [x’s] needs above her own and others. (para 106) both the maternal and the paternal grandparents, but primarily [mrs vasseur] and [mrs gauss], appear to offer a great deal of practical and emotional support to [mr vasseur] and [ms gauss], respectively. the support of both sets of grandparents appears to be valued by both parents, and, their ongoing support as grandparents is likely to be of benefit to [x]. it would appear that the capacity of [ms gauss] and [mrs vasseur] to facilitate [x’s] time with the paternal grandparents, separate to that of [x’s] time with [mr vasseur’s], has contributed to [x] reportedly having positive and established relationships with his paternal grandparents. (para 107) the adults reported that, with time, the difficulties within the two family systems as subsided significantly. this is likely to be benefit to [x] as it will minimise his risk of exposure to conflict within his family. (para 113) there is a dispute between the parents regarding changing [x’s] name to include [mr vasseur’s] surname. a change in [x’s] surname, may support his sense of connection to his paternal family, however, he appears to be already developing strong relationships with his father and paternal grandparents and will likely develop a strong sense of family connection with them regardless of his surname. a change in [x’s] surname may be advantageous as it will provides a continuity of his connection with his paternal family, by name. if however, [mr vasseur] has previously accepted [x’s] surname then it may appropriate to allow it to remain as it is as this was a previously agreed decision between the parents then consideration to [x’s] surname remaining as ‘[gauss]’ could be considered.
