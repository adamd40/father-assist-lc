litigation background

background
the husband messaged to the wife:
hi [ms andreou], my current balance and i haven’t ordered lunch for the kids for tomorrow or bought groceries.[1]
the wife replied:
then i guess that’s a reflection on you as a father...not really on me.. you got 7000 dollars paid out to you in the course of 1 month! your rent is paid and your car is paid. then that’s your problem not mine.[2]
it does not appear to be in dispute that as a result of such deposits the parties are now in advance on the home loan repayments and these funds are now available to redraw.
interim property distribution
...as a generality, the interests of the parties and the court are better served by there being one final hearing of s. 79 proceedings...[3]
