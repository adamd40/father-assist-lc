...protect the child from all forms of physical or mental violence, injury or abuse, neglect or negligent treatment, maltreatment or exploitation, including sexual abuse, while in the care of parent(s), legal guardian(s) or any other person who has the care of the child.

[30] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) – something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act – the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent.
meaningful relationship
...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...
[122] ...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
family violence   an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or ... (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture...
such behaviour must still meet the definition as contained within s 4ab(1).
123. coerce is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as to restrain or constrain by force, law or authority, force or compel, as to do something. 2. to compel by forcible action control is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as: to exercise restraint or direction over, dominate, command the phrase “coerces or controls” is expressed disjunctively. however it may be seen that the two concepts are closely related. together they form an expanded concept of the exercise of power, to restrain another or to cause another to act, by force, domination or command...  ] ...to the extent that it is submitted that the mother’s allegations of “horrific domestic violence” could only be accepted if objectively corroborated, we do not find that any such requirement exists. where domestic violence occurs in a family it frequently occurs in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage, and possibly their children. we cannot accept that a court could never make a positive finding that such violence occurred without there being corroborative evidence from a third party or a document or an admission. we have not been referred to any authority in support of such a proposition. ... [81] the victims of domestic violence do not have to complain to the authorities or subject themselves to medical examinations, which may provide corroborative evidence of some fact, to have their evidence of assault accepted. clearly if they do so it is evidence which may assist the court in determining an allegation.
the parties’ relationship  unsel for the father] so were you frightened of him? [the mother] yes and no. [counsel for the father] was it like? [the mother] sorry. yes, in a sense of he [counsel for the father] let me? [the mother] would always threaten to do – take matters further and cut me off in many ways and that he will ruin me and the children [counsel for the father] was? [the mother] or he will end my life as i’m sleeping so, yes, and then no because i also loved him at the time.[6]
the mother’s allegations
the allegation of sexual assault in february 2020
[counsel for the mother] sir, i suggest to you that ms tajir at no stage during your relationship agreed to you putting your penis in her anus?
[the father] yes. no. i can’t remember that far.
[counsel for the mother] you certainly say though, sir, don’t you, that you never had anal sex with ms tajir, don’t you?
[the father] don’t recall i had.
[counsel for the mother] you don’t recall you had?
[the father] don’t recall i have. i don’t think i have.[13]
[counsel for the mother] so, [mr pachris], you’ve now had the opportunity to view that videotape, yes?
[the father] correct.
[counsel for the mother] and you would agree with me that during the course of the videotape the mother screams?
[the father] yes.
[counsel for the mother] you would agree with me that you hold the mother by her arms?
[counsel for the mother] and that you move and she says, “ow, ow, ow,” repeatedly?
[counsel for the mother] and you would agree with me that you said to her, “shut up, shut up”?
[counsel for the mother] and you would agree with me that when you – when she said to you, “please, please, i’m begging you”?
....
[counsel for the mother] do you accept from me that during the course of that video you had anal intercourse with the mother?
[counsel for the mother] and that you understand what i’m saying there?
[counsel for the mother] thank you. and do you agree that she told you that it hurts?
[counsel for the mother] and that she asked you to – and that you asked her, “do you want me to stop”?
[counsel for the mother] do you agree that you said to her, “when you do this shit again that’s what happens”?
[counsel for the mother] and do you agree with me that when you said that you were threatening her?
[the father] no.
[counsel for the mother] do you agree that the mother hearing that, after you had anally penetrated her, would perceive that as a threat?
[counsel for the mother] because you know, don’t you, that after that incident the mother was bleeding from her anus?
[counsel for the mother] and that she was in a great deal of pain?
[counsel for the mother] and she was crying?
[counsel for the mother] and do you agree with me that she said to you, “you’re so mean”?
[counsel for the mother] and that she was never going to trust you again?
[counsel for the mother] and after she said that you said, “shh. what did you say? say it again”?
[counsel for the mother] and you said that, would you accept from me, in a threatening voice?
[the father] no
[counsel for the mother] and she said, “nothing, nothing”?
[the father] yes, and giggles...[14]
[counsel for the mother] now, i suggest to you, sir, that during the course of that sexual interplay between you and the mother the mother did not consent to you having anal sex with her?
[counsel for the mother] and you knew that she did not consent?
[counsel for the mother] and that you had anal sex with her without her permission?
[counsel for the mother] you see, sir, that evidence is inconsistent, isn’t it? you knew she didn’t want to have anal sex with you?
[counsel for the mother] she told you that it hurt?
[counsel for the mother] she told you to stop?
[counsel for the mother] and you didn’t, did you?
[counsel for the mother] and you continued to have anal sex with her?
[counsel for the mother] and you did so without her consent?
[counsel for the mother] and you didn’t stop when she was moving to get away from you?
[counsel for the mother] and you didn’t stop when she was crying?
[counsel for the mother] and you didn’t stop when she screamed out?
[counsel for the mother] are you saying yes because you’re agreeing me that you didn’t stop?
[the father] no, i’m just saying yes because towards the end of the video she’s laughing. so that’s what – you’re saying crying. i didn’t hear cries. in – in the video she was laughing.
[counsel for the mother] all right. that will be for her honour to determine. i put to you, sir, that there is no laughing by the mother at the end of the video?
[the father] yes, there is.
[counsel for the mother] i suggest to you that there is no laughing by the mother at the end of this video?
[the father] i heard laughing.
[counsel for the mother] you see, sir, you’re punishing the mother by forcing her to have anal sex with you?
[counsel for the mother] you did so to humiliate the mother?
[counsel for the mother] and you did so to punish her for having separated from you?
[counsel for the mother] and you did so to control her?
[counsel for the mother] ...when she indicated that she did not consent to the anal sex you continued with it in any event?
[the father] yes.[15]
allegations as to physical assaults
...i hope u rot for making me kill myself from all the emotional n physical abuse u did to me n my kids...[21] (as per the original)   pachris]: what are you doing? what is she doing here? [ms tajir]: i am allowed to have friends here.[27]
ms h deposes she then peaked into the kitchen and observed the father punch the mother in the shoulder with a closed fist causing her to fall backwards. the father then left the apartment and the mother came back to the balcony. ms h said to the mother: “i saw that. he punched you.” [28] they had a short conversation and the mother said: “please. leave it. i love him. i absolutely love him.” [29] the mother was crying and in tears and ms h did not press the issue further.
you love your kids more than me. you are hopeless. i will leave you one day. i am so fucking sick of you treating everyone better than me. you are fucking full of it. all you care about is the kid’s happiness, never mine.[30]
the mother put the children to bed and went out to the balcony, crying. the father followed her out to the balcony and said to her:
you are nothing but a fucking liar and a dog tell me – who did you see today? i am going to find whoever you were with then deal with them. give me your phone you little slut. gimme it, you whore. [31] (as per the original)
it is the mother’s evidence that as the father then tried to grab the phone from her hand she placed her phone down her shirt and sat with her head down and knees against her chest on the floor whereupon the father kicked her in the head and then left the apartment.
threats to harm
i will kill you in your sleep. at least you won’t feel it. it will be an easy death.[35]
the mother deposes that subsequent to this statement she had many sleepless nights fearing for her safety.
abusive and threatening communications
you are ugly you are disgusting your hair is fucking ugly.[36]
whilst the father denied this allegation in cross-examination, ms h was not challenged on this evidence. in those circumstances, i can comfortably make a finding that this occurred.
coercive and controlling behaviour
you fucking slut. i know you are going with another guy. i know when you say you are out at a certain place you’re fucking lying to me.[39]  e father]: i think [ms tajir] is cheating on me. i do not trust her. [[mr j]]: i think you are over obsessing. she tells me that you constantly turn up where she is. [the father]: i know. but i just do not trust her. [[mr j]]: you can’t do that. that is not a healthy relationship. [the father]: she lies to me. just recently she said she was going to a restaurant but i could see she was at the park. [[mr j]]: how can you tell where she was? [the father]: i track her through her phone gps.[44]  ther]: ill send you the image in half hour. [mother]: image wat image? u left me crying my lungs out allah men fok punish u [father]: when i tracked you [mother]: u tracked me?? lek allah men fok take ur soul u see the excuse u come up with [father]: back then ...

[father]: good morning baby i don’t hide or lie to you for starters those numbers should not be on your phone in the first place make sure you delete it all...[46] (as per the original)
you’re a little slut aren’t you. you like to be fucked like this don’t you, you little slut. you’re enjoying this aren’t you, like the slut you are.[47]
the father denied this incident. the mother was not cross-examined at all as to this incident. i accept and find on balance that this occurred.

physical assaults august 2020-march 2021
denigration, verbal abuse and threats  e mother] ...keyboard warrior, i was scared of him. look at the size of him. [counsel for the father] yes, we’re very aware of his size, but are you saying that it was his effect on you that made you send foul and abusive messages to him? is that right? [the mother] his actions towards me or the way he spoke to me or the way he argued with me over the phone caused me to do that, yes. i was in a different place at the time. i was going through a lot of anxiety, so i would send messages like that out of pain and anger and fearness, because i knew i can only be a keyboard warrior. you wouldn’t understand what i mean, but, like, i feel, like, i can get him back the way he gets me, but through the messages. [counsel for the father] okay? [the mother] like, i would get my revenge from all the abuse that he would put me through when he would come home. so he – when i face him, i can’t say anything.[79]
the mother’s chastisement of the children
socialising with “drug dealer” girlfriends
the additional considerations: section 60cc(3)
my father is dead to me. i hate him. i have no father. i do not ever want to see that man again.[83]
dad is a bad man. i want a new dad. dad makes me and you cry. dad upsets me[84]
my – my kids get traumatised from anyone screaming around them now. and that’s something that i have to hold at the back of my shoulders, because i was – i took too long to walk out.[88]
some trauma responses: sub-clinical ptsd with no functional impairments of note.[92]
discussion
...suffer insecurity, fear, unhappiness, anxiety and hypervigilance from witnessing abusive behaviour of a parent. such effects present a threat to their emotional development. probably the worst danger to children is the role model that a violent parent provides which can lead to children themselves coming to suffer the serious social disability of using violence in their dealings with other people including those they love. such a disability can destroy the most intimate relationships and bring the person into conflict with other people, the police and the law.  ] importantly, the full court in marra held that not only is it necessary for the court to determine whether a parent has a genuine concern about the welfare of the child in the care of the other parent but it is also necessary to determine whether the concerned parent’s parenting capacity will be “discernibly impaired”. ‘discernibly’, or similar expressions that have been used in the relevant authorities to which we have referred, means no more than being an evident or detectable impairment in parenting capacity such that there is an unacceptable risk that the child’s welfare will be adversely impacted.
...the first enquiry is whether there is objectively an unacceptable risk. if there is the court must take steps proportionate to the degree of risk. if there is not, the court may then need to consider whether the residence parent has a genuinely held belief that such a risk exists and whether that will have a significant impact on that party’s capacity as the resident parent and so impinge on the best interests of the children. the court then needs to take steps proportionate to that circumstance...
