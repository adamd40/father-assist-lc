relevant legal principles
the need for a party to proceedings under the act to seek an order for the provision of funds to enable the payment of his or her legal costs of participating in the proceedings has been recognised for many years. it is a reflection of an important matter that distinguishes litigation under the act from civil litigation between parties who are not parties to a marriage, namely that “very often the wealth of the parties is controlled by one rather than both of them” ... ... if the source of jurisdiction is 117(2) of the act then the court may make such order as it considers just provided there are justifying circumstances. if the order is sought under s 79 of the act then the court may make such an order as it considers appropriate provided it is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make the order. if the order is sought under s 74 of the act then the court may make such order as is proper.
