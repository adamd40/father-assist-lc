stanford v stanford
the preferred approach ] in hickey and hickey and attorney-general for the commonwealth of australia (intervener) [2003] famca 395, (2003) flc 93-143 at [39] the full court, in setting out what the case law revealed as the “preferred approach” to the determination of an application under s 79 of the act, referred to four inter-related steps, including that “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of ss. 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”. the full court did not purport to elevate the preferred approach as being mandatory...  ] the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application pursuant to the provisions of section 79. that approach involves four interrelated steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (“the other factors”) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

potential remitted interest
8aag remission of the charge (1) the commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge payable by a person. (2) however, if a person is liable to pay the charge because an amount remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, the commissioner may only remit all or a part of the charge in the circumstances set out in subsection (3), (4) or (5). (3) the commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the commissioner is satisfied that: (a) the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were not due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person, and (b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances. (4) the commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the commissioner is satisfied that: (a) the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person, and (b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances, and (c) having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge. (5) the commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the commissioner is satisfied that: (a) there are special circumstances because of which it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge, or (b) it is otherwise appropriate to do so.   the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were not due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person, and (b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances.   the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances.   the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person, and (b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances, and (c) having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge.   the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances, and (c) having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge.   having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge.   there are special circumstances because of which it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge, or (b) it is otherwise appropriate to do so.   it is otherwise appropriate to do so.
the general interest charge ("gic") from 1 july 1999 the gic replaced the various existing additional charges for late payment in the taxation law. thus, for example, s 204(3) of the itaa imposes a liability to pay the general interest charge if any of the tax which a person is liable to pay remains unpaid after the time by which the tax is due to be paid. section 8aab(4) of the ta act is an index of the provisions of the itaa that deal with liability to the gic, and s 204 is item 9 in that table. the amount of the gic is worked out in accordance with the provisions of division 1 of part iia of the ta act. the gic is penal in character inasmuch as it exceeds a commercial rate of interest, reflecting the time value of money. section 8aag(1) of the ta act provides that the commissioner may remit all or a part of the gic payable by a person. sections 8aag(2), (3), (4) and (5) provide as follows:
"8aag(2) [overdue unpaid amounts] however, if a person is liable to pay the charge because an amount remains unpaid after the time by which it is due to be paid, the commissioner may only remit all or a part of the charge in the circumstances set out in subsection (3), (4) or (5). 8aag(3) [circumstances not due to the person] the commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the commissioner is satisfied that: (a) the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were not due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person, and (b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances. 8aag(4) [where is it fair and reasonable to remit charge] the commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) is the commissioner is satisfied that: (a) the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment were due to, or caused directly or indirectly by, an act or omission of the person, and (b) the person has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or mitigate the effects of, those circumstances, and (c) having regard to the nature of those circumstances, it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge. 8aag(5) [when commissioner may remit charges] the commissioner may remit all or a part of the charge referred to in subsection (2) if the commissioner is satisfied that: (a) there are special circumstances because of which it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge, or (b) it is otherwise appropriate to do so."   there are special circumstances because of which it would be fair and reasonable to remit all or a part of the charge, or (b) it is otherwise appropriate to do so."   it is otherwise appropriate to do so."
... the commissioner has a general discretion under s 255-10 of schedule 1 to defer the time at which an amount of a tax-related liability is due and payable "having regard to the circumstances of your particular case". if the commissioner defers the time at which tax is due and payable, then the gic only becomes payable in the event of non-payment from the extended date, subject to the power of remission given to the commissioner under s 8aag of the ta act. ... the decision-maker then addressed the criteria referred to in each of ss 8aag(3), (4) and (5). the report states, in this respect:
“the applicant is responsible for the delay in payment. he chose not to pay the tax that was payable and instead chose to make an unmeritorious application to defer the time for payment. he took no steps to dispute his liability but rather relied on the result of the determination of the tax appeals by harris and vaiasinni (mr vaiasinni was another of mr bonnell's clients who mr bonnell relied on as a test case for all of his clients. in this regard i refer to the fact that mr bonnell on behalf of mr vaiasinni withdrew the appeal to the federal court to prevent a hearing that had been fixed together with the harris matter). the applicant had not attempted to make any payment or reduce his indebtedness or to reach any agreement in relation to payment. the impact of the assessments on the financial position of the applicant and his capacity to meet his tax liability as required is an important consideration in making a decision. despite having been asked for it in the context of the application for deferral, mr bonnell failed to furnish me with any information or evidence going to establish hardship other than what was set out in his letter dated 21 june 2001. instead i was left to accumulate the documents to which mr bonnell directed me. the relevant documents contained insufficient information and evidence on which i could safely make a finding about the impact of the assessments on the applicant or his current or future financial position to meet his tax liabilities. it therefore cannot be said that it is fair and reasonable to remit the gic under this limb. the applicant has failed to demonstrate any special circumstances, or indeed provide any other reason as to why it is appropriate that the gic be remitted. consequently, the applicant's request for remission should be rejected." thus, the commissioner was not satisfied that the gic should be remitted under any of ss 8aag(3), (4) or (5).
... it is convenient to make some observations as to the operation of s 8aag(3), (4) and (5) of the ta act, before turning to the particular grounds on which it is said that an order of review should be made. section 8aag(3) and s 8aag(4) are true alternatives. section 8aag(5) is intended to cover cases which are not within subs (3) or subs (4): finance facilities pty ltd v federal commissioner of taxation [1971] hca 12, (1970-1971) 127 clr 106, 138. the ambit of the discretion open to the commissioner depends upon which subsection he is proceeding under. the discretion broadens as one moves down the section and is at its broadest when one reaches s 8aag(5)(b), where the commissioner may remit all or a part of the gic if the commissioner is satisfied that it is "otherwise appropriate" to do so. ... in those circumstances, there is no error, let alone a reviewable error, in the decision-maker's finding that the applicant was responsible for the delay in payment. that being so, there was no basis on which the commissioner could properly exercise the s 8aag(3) discretion in favour of the applicant. the commissioner could only act, if at all, under s 8aag(4) or s 8aag(5). the second precondition to the power of remission conferred by s 8aag(4) is that the commissioner is satisfied that the applicant has taken reasonable action to mitigate, or to mitigate the effects of, the circumstances that contributed to the delay in payment. the decision-maker found that the applicant had not attempted to make any payment or reduce his indebtedness or to reach any agreement in relation to payment of the tax in question. the decision-maker was thus not satisfied of the matters referred to in s 8aag(4)(b). that conclusion was sufficient to disentitle the applicant to a remission under s 8aag(4). however, the decision-maker went on to consider s 8aag(4)(c). he said that he had insufficient information about the applicant's financial position to make a finding as to the financial impact of the assessment on the applicant, hence it cannot be said that it was "fair and reasonable" to remit the gic under this section.
