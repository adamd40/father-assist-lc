reasons for judgment
judge glass:
statutory principles
primary considerations
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both of his parents
as [x] grows older, and plays weekend sports, spending time with friends on weekends outside of school, he will also become less inclined to want to travel back to melbourne. the trips would become increasingly disruptive, and likely, the child resentful. eventually, he will probably resist travelling at all.[18]
the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
additional considerations
any views expressed by x and any factors (such as x’s maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to x’s views  is not of an age where he can reason through all of the implications associated with such a significant change, including the impact on his relationship with his father were he to live in queensland. in absolute terms, i am not of the view that any opinion this child has or may offer regarding the proposed relocation should be weighted heavily.[26]
the nature of x’s relationships with each of his parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
with his mother, there is obvious connection and familiarity. she has been prominent in his care to-date. she presents as an attuned, warm, and invested parent. [x] is obviously settled in her care and accustomed to her routine, care practices, and way of doing things.[28]
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to x, to spend time with x, and to communicate with x
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain x
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances, including the likely effect on x of any separation from either of his parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom x has been living
i have determined that if [mr casali] does not consent to [x] relocating with me to [city b] and the court does not permit me to relocate with him, that i will nevertheless move to [city b] without [x], as will my parents. this has been a very difficult decision for me, but i can't see myself continuing to live in melbourne without the opportunities and support available to me in [city b].[32]
conversely, the impact on this child's relationship with his father if he were to move to [city b], would be profound. while [ms yu] has offered a generous regime of visits, each alternate weekend, the dynamic between [x] and his father would fundamentally shift. by living interstate, [x] could not be taken to school on a regular basis by his father. [mr casali] would not be involved in his extracurricular activities, homework, play dates, or wider social network. their time together would take on a more cursory, superficial, and artificial dimension. as [x] grows older, and plays weekend sports, spending time with friends on weekends outside of school, he will also become less inclined to want to travel back to melbourne. the trips would become increasingly disruptive, and likely, the child resentful. eventually, he will probably resist travelling at all.
... the impact on this boy of his mother moving to [city b] without him would be severe. [x] would miss his mother enormously. there would likely be a sense of longing and displacement. he may experience feelings of anger, resentment, and abandonment. he would possibly enter a period of mourning. he may feel devalued that his mother her elected to pursue her new relationship and a life in queensland at the expense of her role in his life. he may struggle to adjust to life full-time with his father, whom i note, has generally had a role in his day-to-day care secondary to that of his mother. the disconnect from his grandparents would be less profound, and while noting they have played a significant role in his care, they have also been absent for periods when they have returned overseas for visa reasons. in all, there will probably be an enormous emotional impact on this child, which may manifest in psychological difficulties, despair, behavioural challenges, and impairment in social and academic functioning.[43]
i would consider the effect of being disconnected from his mother to be greater than if his time with his father were to become constrained. assuredly there would be negative consequences for this boy if he moved to queensland, as outlined in my original report. however, this impact would be reduced in comparison to his mother, who has played a more prominent role in his life (and with whom he is most well connected) – [x] would miss his father and largely lose the benefits of [mr casali’s] positive influence, but the disruption and psychological implications would not be as acute.[44]
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect x’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of x’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of x, to provide for his needs, including emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of either of x’s parents, and any other relevant characteristics of x
if x is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child, his right to enjoy his aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to x, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of his parents
a mother who opts for relocation in preference to maintaining a close bond with her child runs the risk that she will be seen as selfishly preferring her own interests to those of her child, a mother who opts to stay with her child runs the risk of not having her reasons for relocating treated with the seriousness they deserve.[47]
any family violence involving x or a member of x’s family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of x’s family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
any other relevant fact or circumstance
i have been struggling living in [suburb k] since i separated from [mr casali]. when we separated, i had no idea how i was going to make things work on my own, even with my parents helping me with [x]'s care. i feel isolated and unsupported in melbourne. i am usually a happy and outgoing person, but i have been feeling flat, i have trouble sleeping and i cry often.[60]
there is no doubt that [ms yu] would benefit enormously from the proposed change. she has been able to organise her work to be administered from queensland, she would be able to continue unabated her bourgeoning relationship with [mr e], there would be a lifestyle and climate in [city b] that, arguably, exceeds that in melbourne, she would be able to assume residence in a property she has purchased in that state, fulfilling a goal she has had for some time. moreover, she is now a single mother, of a young child, with no family permanently living in melbourne. no doubt, the benefits that [ms yu] would enjoy from being granted permission to move, would also flow onto [x] himself. it is quite possible also that there would be direct lifestyle benefits for this boy, living close to the beach, and forging a connection with other children of [public service] families, in what i understand to be a close-knit community.[61]
parental responsibility
conclusions
there is an inherent tension between, on the one hand, separated parents being able to establish new homes wherever they like and, on the other, their restraint by injunction from living too far apart to avoid any impingement of their children’s ability to retain meaningful relationships with both parents. the conflict is between the best interests of the children to know and have regular personal contact with each parent and the interests of the parents to enjoy a high measure of freedom of movement which is not lost by reason only of their parental responsibility for the children.[68]
while the children’s interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii of the act. parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children. only when the children’s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent’s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children’s best interests.[69]
