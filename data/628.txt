parenting proceedings – legal principles
... having a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.
benefit of meaningful relationship
physical or psychological harm
a. the mother’s previous use of alcohol
b. allegations of historical family violence
i. allegations in relation to mr e
ii. the ‘camping trip’ incident – 4 march 2017
iii. the january 2020 allegation
c. the father’s anger
... it is an oxymoron to expect such possibilities to then be forensically proven on the balance of probabilities according to the civil standard of proof. by definition, possibilities are not, and could never be, probabilities. risks of harm are not susceptible of scientific demonstration or proof (cdj v vaj (1998) 197 clr 172 at [151]), but are instead postulated from known historical facts and present circumstances
d. exposure of the child to the parents’ negative views of each other
... [mr francis] and [ms l] did not react in anger but rather responded in a child -focussed matter. they further acknowledged that, however unwittingly, their behaviour had been towards [x] may not have been appropriate and expressed a desire to rectify their future behaviour.
the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
equal or substantial and significant time with each parent
section 65daa(1) is concerned with the reality of the situation of the parents and the child, not whether it is desirable that there be equal time spent by the child with each parent. the presumption in s 61da(1) is not determinative of the questions arising under s 65daa(1). section 65daa(1)(b) requires a practical assessment of whether equal time parenting is feasible.
additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give those views.
... [x] was also grieved that this was almost two (2) years away, and she was considerably upset by this. [x] both laughed and cried as she made light of the fact that she wished she was not nine (9) years old but 13 years old and hopeful that at this age, she could make her own parenting arrangements. [x] was wishing her childhood away. (emphasis added)
...while those considerations will be relevant in many cases, they are by no means the only issues that a trial judge must consider when considering a child's wishes. there are many factors that may go to the weight that should be given to the wishes of children and these will vary from case to case and it is undesirable and indeed impossible to catalogue or confine them in the manner suggested. ultimately it is a process of intuitive synthesis on the part of any trial judge weighing up all the evidence relevant to the wishes of the children and applying it in a common sense way as one of the factors in the overall assessment of the children's best interests.
the focus placed by the father upon the prescribed consideration stated in s 60cc(3)(a) tended to elevate the views expressed by a child to something approaching a decisive status. in some cases, it may be right, in the exercise of a primary judge's discretion, to accord the views expressed by a child such weight, but s 60cc(3)(a) does not require that course to be taken. they are but one consideration of a number to be taken into account in the overall assessment of a child's best interest
the nature of the children’s relationships with each of their parents and other significant persons in their lives
x’s relationship with mr e and ms f
the extent to which the children’s parents have taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in long-term decision making in relation to the children, to spend time and to communicate with the children
the extent to which each of the children’s parents have fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of a change in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect of a separation from a parent or other significant persons in their lives
the practical difficulty and expense associated with the children spending time and communicating with a parent, and whether that difficulty substantially affects the children’s right to maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of the children’s parents and any other significant person to provide for their needs, including their emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and their parents, and any other characteristics of the children the court thinks relevant
if the children are aboriginal or torres strait islander children
attitude to the child, and to the responsibility of parenthood demonstrated by each of the child’s parents

father’s overholding of x ther] i am not signing your documents for you to be her primary carer, is it your intention to withhold [x] from her mother, until your demands are met? [father] if you disagree with any specifics i’m happy to mediate through a professional mediator. [mr francis].
any family violence involving the children or a member of their family, and if a family violence order applies or has applied, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to further proceedings
