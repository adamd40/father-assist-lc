in relation to changing [x]’s name, it is likely to significantly impact [x]’s sense of his own identity to do that now, while he is most likely struggling with the grief [of the loss of living with his father and loss of contact with paternal family]... if the court accepts that the risk to [x] is likely to be significantly negative by retaining his name and being associated with his father’s criminal history, the additional identity challenges may be worth the possible risks of the change. however, [x] is likely dealing with significant psychological challenges at present and a further identity related challenge could cause him significant negative psychological problems either in the short term or the long term.[31]
