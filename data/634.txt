balance of probabilities

(2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.

... it should not be overlooked that the subdivision, partial sale and funded by that sale, development of the wife’s property, were each made possible by the wife bringing the property into the relationship and undertaking a joint venture with the husband, as well as the husband applying his funds to the enterprise.
since the husband has all of the wife’s bank statements it is submitted that the onus is upon him to establish the wife wasted or sequestered funds in some way during the relationship, not upon the wife to establish how each dollar was applied.

the stanford principle ] first, it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property... the question posed by s 79(2) [and/or section 90sm(3)] is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order.  ] the fundamental propositions that have been identified require a court have a principled reason for interfering with the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties to the marriage and whatever may have been their stated or unstated assumptions and agreements about property interest during the continuance of the marriage. [42] in many cases where an application is made for property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice by made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife...  ] in many cases where an application is made for property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice by made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife...
the preferred approach ] in hickey and hickey and attorney-general for the commonwealth of australia (intervener) [2003] famca 395, (2003) flc 93-143 at [39] the full court, in setting out what the case law revealed as the “preferred approach” to the determination of an application under s 79 of the act, referred to four inter-related steps, including that “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of ss. 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”. the full court did not purport to elevate the preferred approach as being mandatory, as was observed by a later full court in bevan & bevan [2013] famcafc 116, (2013) flc 93-545 at [61]- [63], [72]. however, adoption of that preferred approach is a means by which many of the mandatory factors in s 75(2) of the act, in particular paragraph (b) – the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties, paragraph (ha) – ability of a creditor to recover debt, paragraph (n) – the terms of any proposed order under s 79 of the act, can be considered, as these must be considered, in determining any adjustment pursuant to s 75(2) of the act. conversely, if the preferred approach is not adopted there must be a means discernible from the reasons to identify that these relevant mandatory s 75(2) factors have been considered, and how they have been brought into account, in the making of any s 75(2) adjustment...  ] the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application pursuant to the provisions of section 79. that approach involves four interrelated steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (“the other factors”) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

proving contributions
... in our view, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred in proceedings pursuant to the provisions of section 79 that moneys howsoever received by a party during the course of the parties’ cohabitation, are used by that party for the benefit of the family unit. such moneys, in those circumstances, thus constitute a financial contribution by the parties who received the moneys.
163. subsequently in jabour the full court held at paragraph 43,
“we consider that the decisions in baker and bilous indicate that the court in williams somewhat overstated the importance of the increase in value of a piece of property at the expense of “the myriad of other contributions that each of the parties has made during the course of the relationship” (williams at [26]).
the appropriate weighing of the financial contributions, amongst all forms of contribution, should be as those sums came in, rather than an attempted ‘tracing’ focussed solely on the [b street, suburb c property] construction...
“the proceedings before her honour were spread over four hearing days, due in the main to the legal practitioners' failure to address the real issues and to provide the trial judge with proper documentary evidence as to the nature and quantum of the parties' respective financial contributions to the marriage. in a marriage of four years, with no dependent children being involved on either side, it ought to have been apparent to the parties' legal advisers that each party's actual financial contribution to the marriage was the primary issue.”
it should not be overlooked that the subdivision, partial sale and funded by that sale, the development of the wife’s property, were each made possible by the wife bringing the property into the relationship and undertaking a joint venture with the husband, as well as the husband applying funds to the enterprise.
