my heart sank as i could see the familiar setting of our cars being broken into greeted me. unfortunately, this is a very common occurrence in [city b] and my home and our cars have been broken into before.
i did not know [x]’s passport was in his car and i don’t believe that was on [mr winfield’s] mind either... [mr winfield] certainly did not deliberately neglect to lock his car, we are well aware of the night-time activity and our area and [mr winfield] is quite protective of his car. [mr winfield] slipped up because he was distracted and tired.

consideration
in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interest of the child as the paramount consideration.   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   in relation to any views expressed by the child, the child is too young to express a view. (b) in relation to the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and any other persons, including a grandparent or other relative of the child, the child is in the primary care of the mother and spends time with the father. the child has a strong attachment to her mother and a close and developing relationship with the father. ms c, the father’s partner, gave unchallenged evidence that she and the child have a good relationship. (c) in relation to the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child is, to spend time and to communicate with the child, both parents seek to participate in making decisions about the child. however, the father and the mother are often unable to agree about important matters. i am satisfied that on occasions the father’s stated wish to be involved in decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child has been a smoke-screen for coercive or controlling behaviour. (ca) in relation to the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligation to maintain the child, the mother is subject to a child support assessment requiring her to pay child support to the father. i cannot see that this issue was addressed in the trial affidavits of the parties. however, in cross-examination the mother said she paid child support to the father. in response to my query about the application of the child support formula, counsel for the father said that the father had care of the child 38% of the time according to the assessment and that the father earned about $28,000 a year and the mother earned about $43,000 a year. this was conceded by the mother. counsel for the father said he would tender a copy of the relevant child support assessment but inadvertently failed to do so. however, the assessment does appear in the father’s tender bundle and, given the father’s counsel’s stated intention, i will receive that into evidence. the child support assessment provides for the mother to pay the father $29.48 a week. the father is registered educator and works as an educator. counsel for the father explained that his low income was a result of him working only about one day a week. the father said that he wished to be available to spend time with the child pursuant to the court orders but the order of 27 april 2021 would appear to provide for the child to spend two weekdays, monday and wednesday, with the father. this matter was not pursued further in cross-examination. however, i am satisfied that the mother has fulfilled her obligation to maintain the child and, indeed, she would appear to be responsible for most of the financial cost of caring for the child. while the father may have complied with his legal obligations as far as the child support assessment is concerned, it is less clear that he has fully used his earning capacity. (d) in relation to the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his parents, the mother proposes a significant change in the child circumstances, the effect of which has been discussed elsewhere in these reasons. (e) in relation to the practical difficulty and expense of the child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, as discussed above, the mother’s proposal will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with his father on a regular basis unless the father is able to relocate as well. the father says he will, albeit unwillingly, relocate to perth if the mother is permitted to do so. (f) in relation to the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs, the mother is able to provide for the child’s needs, including emotional and intellectual needs. the father’s repeated display of coercive or controlling behaviour demonstrates a lack of insight into the needs of the child and, consequently, the limits of his capacity to provide for those needs. (g) in relation to the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background of the child and of either of the child’s parents, there are no relevant matters. (h) in relation to if the child is an aboriginal or torres strait islander child, the child is not an aboriginal or torres strait islander child. (i) in relation to the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents, see (b), (c), (ca) and (f) above. (j) in relation to any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family, the father has alleged that the mother’s conduct in withholding the child after she became suspicious that the father may have sexually abused the child was coercive or controlling. i do not accept that allegation. i am satisfied that the mother’s response was genuine although, as she now concedes, ultimately unjustified. i have discussed the mother’s allegations of coercive or controlling behaviour by the father elsewhere. (k) family violence orders are not applicable in this case. (l) in relation to whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child, the court will attempt to make such an order. (m) in relation to any other relevant factors circumstance, there are no other relevant factual circumstances.   in relation to the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and any other persons, including a grandparent or other relative of the child, the child is in the primary care of the mother and spends time with the father. the child has a strong attachment to her mother and a close and developing relationship with the father. ms c, the father’s partner, gave unchallenged evidence that she and the child have a good relationship.
