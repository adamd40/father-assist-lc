within the family law context, those comments [in respect to the adequacy of reasons] should be seen as reinforced by the fact that the nature of the s 79 inquiry is, in essence, a broad discretionary assessment, which is neither an accounting nor mathematical exercise and which, effectively as a corollary, requires a "broad-brush approach".
