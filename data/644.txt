the court orders that:
ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
i need to bring to the attention of the court that i no longer have legal representation. i wish to seek a short adjournment to allow me time to source appropriate counsel. i also note that i was only served by email on tuesday and, given the very serious nature of the claims put forward by the applicant – alongside my neurological difficulty, which directly impacts executive functioning – i do require additional time to respond in a fulsome way and therefore seek a reasonable adjustment. i also wish to bring to the attention of the court that there is an interim family violence order in place which names [x] and myself as the protected person. if it would please the court and the applicant’s counsel, i’m also willing to present [x] to the local police station to affirm she is safe and well to ease any concern. thank you for your time and careful consideration in this sensitive matter.
