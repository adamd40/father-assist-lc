reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
i say the respondent has made many allegations against me all of which are denied. these are lacking any specificity so i can only respond in that i have never physically or sexually assaulted the respondent and i have never acted in a way to intimidate, threaten or control her. on occasion during arguments the respondent has become physically and verbally aggressive towards me, i have responded in self-defence where necessary. further i have never caused harm or neglect to [x] nor caused her to be at risk of any harm. i acknowledge that we have had numerous arguments and especially since [x] was born as i have been very concerned at the respondent’s inability to cope with parenting at the same time as her other issues including her mental health and job stresses. her behaviour towards [x] and me was often very scary and i did what i could to advocate for and protect [x].[5]
the nature of an interim hearing
family violence
violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.
issues to do with relocation
other issues
looks, raised voice, reckless driving (tailgating and going close to cars passing on passenger side) as well as by subtle threats via text message. the respondent has refused to assist with paying bills, left the house we were renting full of rubbish for me to dispose of at my own cost and left the storage locker we had full of junk for me to dispose of at my own cost. the respondent has mislead me about bank accounts and asked me to put in more money than required, she has also let loans default and made me financially dependent on her. the respondent has not let me have any freedom over buying clothes for my child or doing food shopping, she would watch over me and question me, asking to look over shopping carts before i purchase them and getting annoyed when i don’t run purchases by her first. the respondent has pressured me to continue fertility treatment, book a wedding venue and set a date for wedding. she has also pressured me to let her take our daughter on a long holiday despite it not being development age appropriate. the respondent has made light of the abuse and not taken my concerns seriously. she has not accepted responsibility for self or acknowledged past use of violence. the respondent has claimed that the abuse has not happened and would shift responsibility. the respondent has said that i am the cause and that if i was happier things would be okay. the respondent has threatened to break up with me and cause me to be afraid due to the way she looks at me and the mind games that she plays with me, in order to confuse and control me. the respondent controls who i see and talk to and as a result myself and our daughter have been left feeling isolated from friends and family. the respondent has violated my right to feel safe and have agency over thoughts, actions and decisions. the respondent has used coercion and gaslighting to manipulate me into agreeing to decisions most favourable to her. the respondent has picked and belittled me for the way that i do things including house work and child bearing. the respondent has continued to work from home when no longer necessary, ignoring my requess for privacy and time alone with our daughter. the respondent has consistently bullied and controlled me throughout the relationship to the point of me losing free will and agency through to coercive control. the respondent has caused me to feel fearful for our daughter’s physical and mental health. the respondent has blocked me from taking her to medical appointments and gaslighted me into not taking her for assessments for things such as adhd, asd and odd. the respondent has bullied and abused me to the point of mental exhaustion. incidents of family violence have increased and i am seeking an interim order for immediate protection.[12]   damus] disclosed a situation prior to the relationship ending, [ms damus] and the respondent engaged in a significant verbal argument whilst [ms damus] was holding [x] in her arms, [ms damus] reported [x] was heightened including screaming & crying due to the parental conflict.[13]
best interest & parental responsibility
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
conclusions
“[m]aternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents, obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement having been incurred.”[22]
