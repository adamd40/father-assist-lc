orders
the court orders that:
reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
the legal principles applicable
section 117 confers upon the court a broad discretion in relation to costs. that discretion is one which the court should not seek to fetter. as was pointed out by the high court in penfold v penfold:
it is an accurate description of s 117(1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the subsection is not paramount to s 117(2). as subs (1) is expressed to be subject to subs (2), the former must yield whenever a judge finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. subsection (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs.[4]
applicant’s submissions
respondent’s submissions
discussion
it refers to the manner in which each of the parties conducted the proceedings and if as a result of non-cooperation, obstructiveness or otherwise, one of the parties causes the proceedings to be unduly prolonged or made unduly expensive to the other side, clearly an order for costs would be warranted.
