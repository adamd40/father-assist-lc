the law
third, whether making a property settlement order is "just and equitable" is not to be answered by beginning from the assumption that one or other party has the right to have the property of the parties divided between them or has the right to an interest in marital property which is fixed by reference to the various matters (including financial and other contributions) set out in s 79(4). the power to make a property settlement order must be exercised "in accordance with legal principles, including the principles which the act itself lays down"[28]. to conclude that making an order is "just and equitable" only because of and by reference to various matters in s 79(4), without a separate consideration of s 79(2), would be to conflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles laid down by the act.

the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation, actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse’s present or future entitlements under the fund.
in our view it is clear from those comments that the majority in [c & c] (supra) was concerned with a consideration of actual contributions where they were ascertainable. the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation might be relevant in a defined benefits scheme whereas actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation might be relevant to an accumulation fund where in both cases the marriage was of short duration. however, in our view there is nothing said by the majority in [c & c] (supra) that would give any support for the application of some kind of a formula or that contributions to superannuation whatever the nature of the fund, should be treated in a different way from contributions to other property under s 79(4). this is so in our view whether the superannuation is considered as part of one pool of assets or in a separate pool.

as a statement of general principal, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances:   where one of the parties has embarked up on a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effected value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.
first, it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. so much follows from the text of s 79(1)(a) itself, which refers to “altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property”. the question posed by s 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order.
we observe that “notional property”, which is sometimes “added back” to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute “property of the parties to the marriage or either of them”, and thus is not amenable to alteration under s 79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage – and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that s 79(4) and in particular s 75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property.
there is no error committed per se in adjusting the parties’ actual property interests by a calculation involving notionally adding back into the pool sums which have been dissipated by the parties. we reject any suggestion that the decision of bevan & bevan [2013] famcafc 116, (2013) flc 93-545 – or, more particularly, the decision of the high court in stanford & stanford (2012) 247 clr 108 - is authority for any necessary contrary solution. some statements made by the high court may lead to the conclusion that references to “notional property” as have been referred to in decisions of this court and at first instance may need to be reconsidered. the decisions referred to seek to remind the court that, however the exercise of discretion might seek to deal with property that is said to be the subject of “add back”, proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property, and the question posed by s 79(2) as a separate inquiry from any adjustment to property interests by reference to s 79(4) if a consideration of s 79(2) reveals that it is just and equitable to alter existing interests in property.

what were the parties’ financial (direct and indirect) and non-financial (direct and indirect) contributions?
it is therefore necessary...[to] weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties.
in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred in proceedings pursuant to... s.79 [of the act] that monies howsoever received by a party during the course of the parties cohabitation are used by that party for the benefit of the family unit [and] ....thus constitute a financial contribution by the party who received the monies.
initial
in our opinion it is not so much a matter of erosion of contribution but a question of what weight is to be attached, in all the circumstances, to the initial contribution. it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. in the present case that use was a substantial contribution to the purchase of the matrimonial home.
during the relationship
post separation
what were the parties’ contributions to the welfare of the family, including those in the capacity of homemaker or parent?
non-disclosure nce it has been established that there has been a deliberate non-disclosure ... then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party... [t]he court’s jurisdiction to make an order going beyond the identified property arises once there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the party has not made a full disclosure of his or her assets.
this court has pointed out in a line of cases leading up to the relevant decision of the full court in black and kellner [1992] famca 2, (1992) flc 92-287, that it is the duty of a party involved in property proceedings in this jurisdiction to make a full disclosure of their financial affairs.
the obligation [of each party to make a full and frank disclosure] arises because of the necessity for the court in such proceedings to consider all aspects of the financial circumstances of each party, if there is non-disclosure, in the relevant sense, then the failure to disclosure undermines the whole process of adjudication of the proceedings in relation to financial matters, a finding of non-disclosure may, in appropriate cases, depending upon the circumstances, result in the other party being granted, without more, the relief sought.
what is the effect, if any, of any proposed order upon the parties’ earning capacity?
any adjustment under s 75(2) of the act?
a) the age and state of health of each of the parties,
b) the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment,
c) whether either party has the care or control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years,
d) commitments of each of the parties that are necessary to enable the party to support: i) himself or herself, and ii) a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain,
e) the responsibilities of either party to support any other person,
f) subject to subsection (3) the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under: i) any law of the commonwealth, of a state or territory or of another country, or ii)any superannuation fund or scheme, whether the fund or scheme was established, or operates, within or outside australia, and the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party,
g) where the parties have separated or divorced, a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable,
h) the extent to which the payment of maintenance to the party whose maintenance is under consideration would increase the earning capacity of that party by enabling that party to undertake a course of education or training or to establish himself or herself in a business or otherwise to obtain an adequate income,
ha) the effect of any proposed order on the ability of a creditor of a party to recover the creditor's debt, so far as that effect is relevant,
j) the extent to which the party whose maintenance is under consideration has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other party,
k) the duration of the marriage and the extent to which it has affected the earning capacity of the party whose maintenance is under consideration,
l) the need to protect a party who wishes to continue that party's role as a parent,
m) if either party is cohabiting with another person, the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation,
n) the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 79 in relation to: the property of the parties, or vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party,
naa) the terms of any order or declaration made, or proposed to be made, under part viiiab in relation to: a party to the marriage, or a person who is a party to a de facto relationship with a party to the marriage, or the property of a person covered by subparagraph (i) and of a person covered by subparagraph (ii), or of either of them, or vested bankruptcy property in relation to a person covered by subparagraph (i) or (ii),
na) any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the marriage has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the marriage,
o) any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account,
p) the terms of any financial agreement that is binding on the parties,
q) the terms of any part viiiab financial agreement that is binding on a party to the marriage,
the wording of section 79(1), itself, in my opinion clearly limits the application of the court’s power to property existing at the time of the hearing. in my opinion, section 79(1) does not give the court a power to order a settlement out of property which does not exist and could only be brought into existence by the exercise of an alleged borrowing capacity.
are the proposed orders just and equitable?
the court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.
whilst it may, as a matter of individual circumstance, be correct to say that the mere existence of disparity of wealth ought not of itself justify a settlement of property to one party at the expense of the other, it may often, in the overall circumstances of a case, call for further adjustment beyond that assessed on contributions alone, so that the final order is just and equitable...
