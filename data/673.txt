“[i]n considering whether the justice of a case requires some act done by a party to be taken into account under s. 75(2)(o), the court should, we think, have regard primarily to the existence or otherwise of any legal obligations, as between the parties, in relation to the doing of that act, and also, perhaps, to ordinary notions of justice and equity between the parties.”[21]
