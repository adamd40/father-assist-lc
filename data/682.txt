orders
the court orders that:
reasons for judgment
judge glass
statutory framework
proceedings alleged to be vexatious
mr ademis’ initiating application filed 17 april 2019
in my view, having regard to that chronology, and in particular the father’s history of filing applications and then failing to prosecute them, i am satisfied that he has abused the court’s processes. i am also satisfied that his conduct in making no less than three applications, causing them to be served and then discontinuing the proceedings is conduct that has harassed and annoyed the mother and likely caused her significant distress, particularly in the context of her suffering symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of her experience of family violence.
