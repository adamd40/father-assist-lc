parenting orders to be made
property
is it just and equitable that an order be made?
... is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.
assets, liabilities and financial resources as at the date of final hearing
contributions
section 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) /90sm(4)(a), (b) and (c) of the act
...weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties or provide for a transfer of property in specie in accordance with that assessment.
the judge must weigh up various areas of contribution. in a short marriage, significant weight might be given to a large capital contribution. in a long marriage, other factors often assume great significance and ought not be left almost unseen by eyes dazzled by the magnitude of recently acquired capital... what is important is to somehow give a reasonable value to all of the elements that go to making up the entirety of the marriage relationship.
...however, the task of assessing contributions is holistic and but part of a yet further holistic determination of what orders, if any, represent justice and equity in the particular circumstances of this particular relationship.

what orders are just and equitable
spousal maintenance
applicable law – spousal maintenance
a party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first-mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself ... having regard to any relevant matter referred to in section 75(2).
taken together, then, we would state the law as being that an award of spousal maintenance requires:
1. a threshold finding under section 72, 2. consideration of section 74 and section 75(2), no fettering principle that pre-separation standard of living must automatically be awarded where the respondent's means permit, and discretion exercised in accordance with the provisions of s 74, with 'reasonableness in the circumstances' as the guiding principle.
