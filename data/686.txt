and the court notes that:
res tempore reasons for judgment
judge o’shannessy
... there is a high level of conflict between [the father] and [the mother] which prevents them from developing a co-operative parenting relationship. prior to the separation, [the father] would have had ongoing concerns about [the mother] given her drug addiction. there are clearly unresolved issues from their relationship and separation. [the father] has no trust of [the mother] for genuine reasons in regard to her drug addiction. [the mother] alleged [the father] was violent which [the father] denied. these allegations would need to be tested in court. ... [the mother] acknowledged she had a ‘pain killer addiction’ as she referred to her addiction, but she then referred to it as ‘self-medicating’, she also acknowledged she attempted many overdose attempts as well as self-harming, for which she blames [the father] for all of this alleging he was violent which as noted above, [the father] denied. [the mother] also acknowledged that the children were at risk as a result of her addiction. [the mother] now claims that she is ‘off all pain killers’ which her mother helped her to do. on the other hand, [the mother] then provided a list of all the ‘pain killers’ she still takes so she contradicted herself by saying she is now off all ‘pain killers’ but then provided a list of the ‘pain killers’ she now takes. it is my view, that this leaves a concern as to what level of risk [the mother] still poses. [the mother] must have a psychiatric assessment and report before any consideration could be given for her spending time with [the child]. while [the mother] said that she now has webster packs from her pharmacy, there is still nothing preventing her from taking a week’s supply of prescribed medication. one of the prescribed medication [the mother] mentioned is lyrica, which i understand may sometimes cause addiction, with the risk being higher if the person has a substance use disorder (this information is available online), which is why it is very necessary for [the mother] to have a psychiatric assessment and report so the psychiatrist can assess [the mother] appropriately.
... [the mother] demonstrated a good understanding of her early childhood and adolescent difficulties...  phasis added)
... in making interim decisions the court will still often be faced with conflicting facts, little helpful evidence and disputes between the parents as to what constitutes the best interests of the child. however, the legislative pathway must be followed. 82. in an interim case that would involve the following: (a) identifying the competing proposals of the parties, (b) identifying the issues in dispute in the interim hearing, (c) identifying any agreed or uncontested relevant facts, (d) considering the matters in s 60cc that are relevant and, if possible, making findings about them (in interim proceedings there may be little uncontested evidence to enable more than a limited consideration of these matters to take place), (e) deciding whether the presumption in s 61da that equal shared parental responsibility is in the best interests of the child applies or does not apply because there are reasonable grounds to believe there has been abuse of the child or family violence or, in an interim matter, the court does not consider it appropriate to apply the presumption, (f) if the presumption does apply, deciding whether it is rebutted because application of it would not be in the child’s best interests, (g) if the presumption applies and is not rebutted, considering making an order that the child spend equal time with the parents unless it is contrary to the child’s best interests as a result of consideration of one or more of the matters in s 60cc, or impracticable, (h) if equal time is found not to be in the child’s best interests, considering making an order that the child spend substantial and significant time as defined in s 65daa(3) with the parents, unless contrary to the child’s best interests as a result of consideration of one or more of the matters in s 60cc, or impracticable, (i) if neither equal time nor substantial and significant time is considered to be in the best interests of the child, then making such orders in the discretion of the court that are in the best interests of the child, as a result of consideration of one or more of the matters in s 60cc, (j) if the presumption is not applied or is rebutted, then making such order as is in the best interests of the child, as a result of consideration of one or more of the matters in s 60cc, and (k) even then the court may need to consider equal time or substantial and significant time, especially if one of the parties has sought it or, even if neither has sought it, if the court considers after affording procedural fairness to the parties it to be in the best interests of the child.

famcafc 13 the majority (boland and thackray jj) discussed at [88] of their reasons the care necessary to be exercised in making findings in interim parenting proceedings. their honours said:
[88] in our view, findings made at an interim hearing should be couched with great circumspection, no matter how firmly a judge’s intuition may suggest that the finding will be borne out after a full testing of the evidence. 3] later, at [100] their honours amplified their comments and said:
[100] the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
