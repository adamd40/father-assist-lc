ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge o’shannessy ] [child [x]] attended a visit with [the father] on 9 july 2022. [child [y]] was at a friend's house for a sleepover and she had called [the father] earlier that week to inform him. after the visit, [child [x]] returned home and he was not his usual self. he was disengaged and did not want to speak about the visit with me. this is unusual for [child [x]]. he is generally a very happy talkative child. the following morning, [child [x]] asked me to come into his room as he had something to tell me. [child [x]] said that he does not want to go back to [the father]’s house. he said that during the day on the saturday, [the father] was driving erratically with him in the back seat. [child [x]] told me that [the father]'s friend [ms d] was in the car and they were discussing rape and that [ms d] was a 'rapist ' in front of him. i am aware that [ms d] was recently released from a period of incarceration as a result of charges including burglary, theft of guns, possessing a trafficable amount of firearms, two counts of possessing a firearm while a prohibited person, theft and committing an indictable offence while on bail. [the father]'s brother ... was the co-accused in these matters. [18] [child [x]] asked me what rape was. he said that they were 'going really fast ' in the car and he was scared. he said that [the father] and [ms d] were hanging out the car windows yelling 'fuck you copper dogs ' and sticking their middle finger up at them. [child [x]] was significantly distressed telling me these things. he further told me that later that night, [the father] left the house and said he was going to return with mcdonald's. [child [x]] said that [the father] did not come home ‘for hours’ and he was staggering into walls intoxicated. he said that [the father’s partner] was trying to help him walk and he began to yell and swear at her. he stood over her and screamed in her face calling her derogatory names like a 'bitch' and a 'slut'. [child [x]] told me that he was too scared to move from the couch and he sat there crying until [the father’s partner] carried [the father] to bed. [child [x]] told me that [the father] is often coming home intoxicated. at changeover the following day, [child [x]] said that [the father] told him 'what is said and seen here, stays here.’ [child [x]] told me that this was not the first time [the father] has said words to this effect. [19] i tried to console [child [x]] as best i could. it was clear that he was uncomfortable and upset by the situation. [child [x]] was crying and asked whether i would tell [the father] what he said to me. he is frightened of [the father] and what he may do to him.  ] [child [x]] asked me what rape was. he said that they were 'going really fast ' in the car and he was scared. he said that [the father] and [ms d] were hanging out the car windows yelling 'fuck you copper dogs ' and sticking their middle finger up at them.
