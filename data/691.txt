judge o’shannessy ] that [the child] constantly be referred to and enrolled at school and all activities by the surname that is registered on her birth certificate. the issue about her surname remains in dispute between the parties.
section 64b meaning of parenting order and related terms ... 2. a parenting order may deal with one or more of the following: ... (i) any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.   any aspect of the care, welfare or development of the child or any other aspect of parental responsibility for a child.  ] [the child] has frequently cried monday nights, and asked not to go to [the father’s] house on tuesday, since separation. in the past six months, her distress has increased in intensity and [the child] has been crying every monday night and tuesday morning, begging me on not to make her go to visit [the father] on tuesdays. [the child] states that the adults sit around and talk and ignore her, that she has nothing to do and that when they put her to bed they just say goodnight, turn the light off and close the door, she does not get tucked in, or a goodnight kiss or cuddle. she states she is scared at night alone in the dark, but she refuses to tell [the father] that. she says she cries herself to sleep, but tries to cry quietly into the pillow so that [the father] doesn't hear her. [46] since [the father] has been asking to have [the child] for a whole week in the school holidays [the child] has become more and more angry. the first time he asked, i told her that she might go to stay with her dad for a week in the school holidays and she immediately said 'no'. she explained it is too long, she does not want to be there for that long. i convinced her to stay for four nights, but she was really upset when she got home and told me it was too long. she said ‘i asked dad if i could call you and he just said no’.  ] since [the father] has been asking to have [the child] for a whole week in the school holidays [the child] has become more and more angry. the first time he asked, i told her that she might go to stay with her dad for a week in the school holidays and she immediately said 'no'. she explained it is too long, she does not want to be there for that long. i convinced her to stay for four nights, but she was really upset when she got home and told me it was too long. she said ‘i asked dad if i could call you and he just said no’.   during [the child]’s interview, she presented as a personable, confident and articulate child who seemed to express herself comfortably. she provided thoughtful comments about her situation...
... harmful conflict considerations  ] the contrast between [the child]’s expressed enjoyment of her time with her father and her warm relationship with him was in significant contrast to the information provided by [the mother]. [the child] appeared to confirm the father’s perspective of her spend time arrangements with him and their relationship. [25] [the father] stated that [the mother] had purposefully made false claims about [the child’s] views about her time and relationship with him, which might be the case, or not. it is feasible that, for whatever the reason, [the child] is not able to hold her father in a positive life in her mother’s household, and potentially she feels she needs to report negatively against him. situations where a child negatively reports against an otherwise well loved parent usually develops due to a number of complex factors. this may include, psychological disturbance in one or both parents, unresolved loss and grief about the parental separation by one or both parents, family of origin issues for one or both parents, long standing and protected parental discord and a lack of parental cooperation. a factor in this matter that might be impacting adversely on [the child’s] experience of being parented is that she has been given adult like responsibilities by [the mother] including to determine her spend time arrangements with [the father]. while asking a child’s opinion might appear to be child focussed behaviour, in reality, it can place a considerable emotional burden on the child and causes the child to become a significant player in the parental dispute and conflict, to their detriment. moreover, sometimes a child feels a need, for whatever the reason, to support one or other parent’s position on any given issue.  ] [the father] stated that [the mother] had purposefully made false claims about [the child’s] views about her time and relationship with him, which might be the case, or not. it is feasible that, for whatever the reason, [the child] is not able to hold her father in a positive life in her mother’s household, and potentially she feels she needs to report negatively against him. situations where a child negatively reports against an otherwise well loved parent usually develops due to a number of complex factors. this may include, psychological disturbance in one or both parents, unresolved loss and grief about the parental separation by one or both parents, family of origin issues for one or both parents, long standing and protected parental discord and a lack of parental cooperation. a factor in this matter that might be impacting adversely on [the child’s] experience of being parented is that she has been given adult like responsibilities by [the mother] including to determine her spend time arrangements with [the father]. while asking a child’s opinion might appear to be child focussed behaviour, in reality, it can place a considerable emotional burden on the child and causes the child to become a significant player in the parental dispute and conflict, to their detriment. moreover, sometimes a child feels a need, for whatever the reason, to support one or other parent’s position on any given issue.
... developmental considerations  ] children of [the child’s] age start to understand more about their place in the world and they generally pay more attention to friendships and teamwork and they want to be liked and accepted by friends. that [the child] understands that she is known by 3 different surnames depending on the setting and which parents she lives with is a concern and further demonstrates her exposure to the parental conflict and dispute. moreover, if [the child] constantly feels a need to keep things from one or other parent, or to directly tell untruths, there may be serious adverse impacts on her moral development and long term good adjustment.
parental understanding of the child’s needs  ] when [the mother] was provided with feedback about [the child’s] expressed views, she was visibly shocked and upset and she became a little teary. she appeared to be genuinely taken aback and confused about why [the child] had indicated a different view of her situation to the writer than was known to her. [the mother] appeared open to reflecting on whether the matter was more complex than she initially thought. [30] however, [the mother] later suggested that [the child] might have made false reports about her time and relationship with [the father] because she was aware that he would learn about her views and she wished to placate him. she further reported that [the child] wanted her surname changed to rafferty-lambert and that her views about that needed to be given considerable weight, displaying limited parental reflective capacity in this regard. [the mother] asked if the writer had asked [the child] about that, which she had not.  ] however, [the mother] later suggested that [the child] might have made false reports about her time and relationship with [the father] because she was aware that he would learn about her views and she wished to placate him. she further reported that [the child] wanted her surname changed to rafferty-lambert and that her views about that needed to be given considerable weight, displaying limited parental reflective capacity in this regard. [the mother] asked if the writer had asked [the child] about that, which she had not.
... (emphasis added)  ] in regards to the parental relationship, [the child] explained that her parents “don’t get along” and “school holidays, it’s the hardest time for all 3 of us”. [the child] stated, “whenever school holidays are coming up, it’s hard for me”. she explained that she feels pressured from both parents about her school holiday arrangements. [17] [the child] further added, “it[’]s just 2 weeks to go (until the upcoming december school holidays) and it’s not sorted” and she feels very worried about that. [the child] said that usually “it[’]s sorted” by this time as her father normally emails her mother 2 weeks before any school holiday period. that it has not been sorted out, [the child] said, “it’s a worry for me”.  ] [the child] further added, “it[’]s just 2 weeks to go (until the upcoming december school holidays) and it’s not sorted” and she feels very worried about that. [the child] said that usually “it[’]s sorted” by this time as her father normally emails her mother 2 weeks before any school holiday period. that it has not been sorted out, [the child] said, “it’s a worry for me”.  ] at this stage, the most immediate need for [the child] is that she be protected from the adult dispute. specifically, at this stage, [the child] would benefit from court orders that provide for clearly defined school holiday spend time arrangements with both parents, during the interim and over the longer term.   prior to the child impact report, [the mother]’s solicitor contacted vic ccs indicating that [the child] had expressed extreme concern and anxiety to her psychologist about her interview and had asked multiple times if she were allowed to have someone in the room with her as a support person, such as her mother, her psychologist or a close family friend. [the mother] re-stated this during her interview and suggested a support person be present. it was explained to [the mother] that [the child] would need to be interviewed separately and both parents were advised that [the child] would be supported and encouraged to participate by the writer but that there would no pressure placed on her to participate if she felt uncomfortable and did not wish to do so.  -020] changing a child’s name the law was originally set out in chapman and palmer ... and held that each case was to be dealt with in a way that would promote the welfare of the child. matters for consideration were: welfare of the child as the paramount consideration short and long-term effects of a change any embarrassment to the child any confusion of identity, and effect a change in name would/may have with the parent whose name the child bore in the marriage. additional factors were identified in beach and semmler (1979) flc 90-692, [1979] fcwa 1 to be: advantages both short and long-term in a change contact the parent has had with the child degree of identification with both the parents degree of identification with any new child, and parent’s wishes.
decisions in cases as chapman & palmer took place against the widely accepted conventions (it was never a rule of law) that on marriage the wife took the husband’s surname, and the children also took that surname.
