is it just and equitable that an order be made?
...is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.
section 90sm(4)
weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties or provide for a transfer of property in specie in accordance with that assessment: see aleksovski & aleksovski [1996] famca 111 at [50] (baker and rowlands jj) (“aleksovski”).
... the task of the court in proceedings under s.79 is not akin to an accounting exercise. the task is to examine the facts of each case carefully to decide what is appropriate and just and equitable in the circumstances. there cannot be expected to be a universal answer to that question on any given set of facts. it is of the essence of judicial discretion that different minds may comfortably arrive at different conclusions.

[1] the wife did not specify this amount but this figure is calculated working back from the other two figures which are not controversial. the wife’s evidence was her legal costs were in fact far in excess of this figure.
