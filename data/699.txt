summary of the mother’s case
summary of the father’s case and witnesses ] notwithstanding [the mother]’s counselling in the post-separation period, she has not provided a psychological evaluation or report concerning her mental health. how much [the father]’s alleged behaviour has impacted [the mother]’s adjustment to the separation is difficult to determine objectively and, by its nature, is usually a subjective experience. if the matter proceeds, the court may wish to consider a psychological or psychiatric evaluation of the parties to determine their personality functioning, mental health difficulties, and the impact of these factors on their parenting capacity.
evidence of mr k
interview with [the father] [13] [the father]’s logic and approach to problem-solving were somewhat reductive, which was apparent when discussing the estranged relationship with his children from a previous relationship. he was unable to articulate his reasoning for not informing his children of [the child]’s existence or vice versa. there was a tendency towards denial and avoidance when confronted with issues requiring a more integrated and sophisticated emotional response. consequently, he appears to have struggled in the post-separation period. albeit, he described becoming more accepting in recent times. [17] [the father] informed the writer he didn't want to separate and was willing to make changes to save the relationship. however, it became clear that [the mother] had psychologically and emotionally left the relationship, they were sleeping in separate rooms, and she wanted him to leave the house. he was initially reluctant to move out, but his lawyer advised against staying after [the mother] had implied a negative inference in her affidavit concerning [the child] sleeping in his bed. they entered into a 9/5 arrangement, and [the father] resolved to put all his energies and focus into his relationship with [the child]. in november 2020, they settled on an 8/6 structure for their final orders. [19] concerning paragraph 48, [the father] described witnessing the incident and hearing his sisters say hello to [the mother]. further, his sisters met with [the mother] for coffee after she complained about a lack of respect. [the father] notes his sisters had told [the mother] that their relationship could not be maintained at its previous levels. however, they offered continued support and help for [the mother] with [the child]. ... [21] concerning paragraph 58, [the father] acknowledged that [the child] sleeps in his bed. her bedroom is on the opposite side of the house, and she frequently complains of feeling anxious and scared at night. [the father] notes that [the child] co-slept with the parties during the marriage and continues to co-sleep with [the mother] in the post-separation period. [22] concerning paragraphs 60, 61 and 62, [the father] described a friendship with the maternal uncle, who had indicated he was aware of the circumstances precipitating the end of the marriage. he acknowledged confiding with the parents of [the child]'s school friend about the relationship breakdown. however, the parent in question then disclosed the information to the other parents at school. [the father] explained it was never his intention to undermine [the mother] or for the details to become public. in general, [the father] described [the child]'s [town c] school community as close-knit. there is significant gossip between the children's mothers at school drop-offs and pickups, and people have formed their own opinions. [23] notwithstanding the allegations, [the father] notes that [the mother] has a large circle of friends in the [town c] area, where she has resided for approximately 20 years. [the father] informed the writer he has experienced similar ignoring and rejection by [the mother]'s friends and acquaintances when he has come across them in the community. however, he believes that [the mother]'s expectations that family and friends should behave as if nothing has changed are unrealistic and naive. [the father] deposes that he has generally kept his communication with [the mother] on a civil and businesslike footing. [24] [the father] explained that, more recently, he felt he was recovering from the shock and dislocation of the separation. he has begun to feel more optimistic about his circumstances, particularly his increased parenting role with [the child]. in this context, [the father] gave a detailed overview of the deep and enduring relationships that [the child] has with extended family, friends, and sporting and community affiliations in the [town c] area that are intrinsically connected to him and his family. [25] [the father] is categorically opposed to [the mother]'s proposal for relocation. he believes that [the child] will be significantly psychologically and emotionally disadvantaged by the proposed reduction in their time together and the removal from her extended family, friendships and community. interview with [the mother] ... [27] [the mother] gave a similar description of the early relationship to that of [the father], [the father]’s approach to the relationship was intense and passionate, it was happy and harmonious, and they were both work-focused. however, in the years prior to the birth of [the child], [the mother] began to experience [the father] as "possessive and obsessive", and she attempted to leave the relationship on two occasions. [the mother] stated, "[the father] is intense. i didn't feel the relationship was equal. i felt like i was drowning". she described [the father] as a somewhat driven individual with fixed ideas and lacking in flexibility. [28] by way of example, [the father] avoided pursuing a relationship with his children from a previous relationship and refused to inform them of [the child]'s existence until 2019. he was resistant to information of difference around this and other issues. he rejected [the mother]'s attempts to persuade him and change his mind. [the mother] explained, “i was the one that had to tell [the child] about his kids. [the child] thinks the kids don 't want to have a relationship with her because of the way he managed it”. ... [31] [the mother] described the relationship deteriorating throughout 2019. she had undergone [an operation] and was anxious that [the father] would not step up to his responsibilities while she was incapacitated and in recovery. her fears concerning [the father]'s lack of support were confirmed by his behaviour after discharge from the hospital, and the maternal grandmother moved in to provide parenting support for [the child]. [the mother] stated, "i just felt let down. i knew it was over, mum came up and helped''. [32] [the mother] described the above events as the context for their deteriorating relationship. she subsequently made contact with an ex-boyfriend on social media, and they began a texting relationship after meeting at a funeral. [the mother] expressed a deep sense of regret and embarrassment concerning the text messages, the circumstances in which the relationship ended, and the hurt it had caused [the father]. ... [34] [the mother] believes that the 8/6 structure is counterintuitive to [the child]'s psychological and emotional needs. she is of the view that the arrangement is not representative of the primary caregiver role she continues to provide around the emotional, organisational, and practical support she gives to [the child] in the post-separation period. further, she is concerned that [the father]’s intense personality has led to a somewhat intrusive parenting approach. [the mother] believes that [the father] has become emotionally dependent on his relationship with [the child] in ameliorating his adjustment to the separation. [35] [the mother] reiterated the allegations concerning [the father]'s alleged post-separation undermining of her relationships with family and friends in the community. she described experiencing a general hostility from [the father] towards her in the post-separation period. [the mother] believes this behaviour has undermined the integrity of the shared care arrangement and is evidence of [the father]'s poor adjustment in the post-separation period. [36] by way of example, she described the paternal family ignoring and excluding her in public, causing [the child] to be confused and anxious. she alludes to numerous instances of [the father] being curt or openly hostile towards her when communicating around parenting matters. further, she alleges [the father] has actively undermined her reputation with friends and acquaintances in the community. [the mother] described [the father]'s behaviour as causing her considerable distress and mental anguish. her mental health has been significantly impacted by his alleged behaviours, which has made it difficult for her to continue living in [town c]. [the mother] has sought counselling to assist in managing her interactions with [the father] but now experiences feelings of anxiety when out in the community. she is concerned about the impact of her mental health on her parenting capacity with [the child]. [37] [the mother] explained that she is seeking to relocate to [town e] to be closer to the support of extended family in the [outer] suburbs of melbourne. she reports feeling isolated and unsupported in her current circumstances, and her friendship group has changed significantly due to the separation. [the mother] relies heavily on the maternal grandparents for childcare during holiday periods and when she is required to work in the melbourne area. .. [39] [the mother] acknowledged that [the father] would experience a period of adjustment after relocation. however, she is of the view that [the child] is psychologically and emotionally resilient and, with the right support, will make a successful adjustment to the move. she was somewhat vague and noncommittal concerning the move's potential impact on [the father]'s relationship with [the child]. [40] [the mother] notes that, notwithstanding the current arrangements, which have been in place since november 2020, she has been the primary caregiver to [the child]. despite the existing structure, [the mother] deposes that she is still the parent responsible for [the child]'s psychological and emotional support. she experiences [the father]'s alleged hostility and aggression towards her as intolerable and a drain on her mental health. [the mother] perceives the relocation as intrinsic to her mental health and well-being, which, in turn, impacts her parenting capacity with [the child]. ... interview with [the child] (aged nine) ... [42] [the child] attends [x] primary school and is in grade three, she gets on well with her teacher, and her peer relationships appear stable and positive, notwithstanding she has had difficulties with one particular child this year. [the child] plays extracurricular [sports] and has been involved with [sports] in the past. [43] the child]'s memories of family life were largely positive. she reports her mother did most of the parenting, her father worked long hours, and her parents rarely argued. she became aware of her parent's separation after reading a note she found on the kitchen table. her father has said little about the breakup, and her mother later explained that it was about adult issues and problems. [44] concerning her understanding of the separation, she stated, "i spoke with mum about the separation. she is the one i can talk to more easily. it's easier to talk about my feelings with mum". [the child] notes that she still relies on her mother for emotional support and the practical day-to-day care and organisation of her life. by way of example, her mother is still responsible for liaising with the school, her medical needs, doctor's appointments, and the organisational requirements around her extracurricular and social activities. [45] concerning her relationship with [the father], [the child] reports that she often worries about hurting her father's feelings. [the child] explained, "dad's feelings get hurt more easily. mum is better at looking after her own emotions. i can kinda read dad's emotions. i can tell when he 's angry or sad''. [the child] perceived her father as the parent most impacted by the separation and noted that [the father] had been angry with her mother about the "split up". [46] [the child] explained, "it was hard early on. it felt weird going to dads in the beginning. it felt more like home at mum's, it's not so bad now". [the child] indicated that her father had been significantly unhappy during the post-separation period and stated, "i've seen dad unhappy a lot. i feel like i need to make him happy by spending time with him and playing with him. mum doesn't make me feel like i have to make her happy. i think dad is still angry with mum". [47] however, [the child] indicated that her sense of stability in the relationship with her mother had been impacted by the relocation proposal. [the child] explained, "i feel stuck in the middle. mum is always talking about moving, it upsets me a lot. i will miss my friends, my dad, and the house we live in". [the child] began crying and appeared distressed and upset after expressing her opposition to the relocation. she could see no positive outcomes from the move and was adamant in her opposition to the relocation. [the child] informed the writer that her mother talks about the move to [town e] frequently, and she feels constantly upset by the prospect. [the child] stated, "i don't want to move, the moving thing is on my mind all the time. i've told mum i don't want to move". observations of the parties with [the child] .. [49] the observations of the parties with [the child] were unremarkable. [the child] moved between her parents without any sign of anxiety or apprehension and was relaxed and at ease in their care. both parties were sensitive to [the child]’s fatigue and potential triangulation in the dispute. evaluation [50] [the mother]'s proposal to relocate to [town e] is predicated on her lived experience in [town c] in the post-separation period and the need to be closer to family support. she reports feeling pressured into the current arrangement, which she believes does not reflect the parenting input of the parties during the relationship. [the mother] described the communication and cooperation between the parties as poor. she is of the view the current shared care arrangement is not in [the child]'s best interest. [the mother] alleges that [the father] has undermined her standing in the community and that he has behaved in a hostile and aggressive manner towards her. she perceives herself as having been left with fewer supports and social resources due to his behaviour, and her mental health has deteriorated correspondingly. [51] in the alternative, [the father] acknowledges struggling to adjust in the early days of the separation, but not to the extent described by [the mother]. he categorically denies the allegations of undermining and aggressive behaviour toward [the mother]. he is of the view that [the mother] has developed unrealistic expectations concerning her relationship with his family and friends. he has significantly increased his parenting input with [the child] in the post-separation period. he believes she will be psychologically and emotionally harmed by a diminution in their relationship and her removal from extended family, friends, and social networks. the post-separation relationship and arrangements [52] parental adjustment to separation is similar to the paradigm of grief and loss. the parties transition through a series of stages that are non-linear, usually uneven, and do not mirror each other's experiences. in most cases, the party that leaves the relationship has mentally prepared for and rehearsed the emotional upheaval that the separation precipitates. the adjustment process is well underway before the physical separation occurs. [53] the party left lags behind in the process, and the various stages of disorientation, grief, denial, anger, resignation, and later acceptance, occur out of sync with the other party's adjustment. this differential in adjustment often accounts for the early friction, anger, and high expressed emotion commonly associated with the post-separation period. the process can be impacted by the individual's personality structure, mental health difficulties, or other external variables outside their control. [54] prima facie, [the father] displays a somewhat rigid and reductive approach to problem-solving, particularly around issues concerning emotional, interpersonal and psychological aspects of his relationships. his early responses to the separation have been terse, blaming and lacking insight into his role in the relationship breakdown. he has struggled to manage his emotions and sought solace and support through personal disclosures to others concerning [the mother]'s behaviour. he displayed little insight into the impact of this behaviour on [the mother]'s relationships in the community and her interpersonal functioning. [55] by his own account, [the father] has struggled with his adjustment to the separation. he is perceived by [the child] as the parent most vulnerable and angry about the breakdown of the marriage. [the child]'s narrative suggests a porous boundary between father and child, and her focus on his happiness and mood is a somewhat inappropriate burden for a child of this age. [56] while the above issues do not reach the clinical levels of a maladaptive adjustment or family violence dynamic, they do call into question the appropriateness of the current arrangement. the 8/6 structure, to all intents and purposes, is a shared care arrangement, and the writer holds some concern about [the father]'s capacity to communicate and cooperate effectively in this context. [57] the research and literature on shared care describe the prerequisite conditions for optimal outcomes with this type of arrangement as, a high level of constructive communication and problem-solving, alignment of parenting values, and the ability of both parties to keep their disputes encapsulated. the goal is to provide a relatively seamless transition between households that enables the child to engage in their social, school and community relationships, uninterrupted and in the absence of parental conflict. [58] the conditions described above have not been apparent in the post-separation context to date. in the event that the court does not permit the relocation, it is the writer's view that a 9/5 arrangement would more accurately reflect [the child]'s primary attachment relationship with her mother, more clearly define the parenting roles, and be a more intuitive fit with her psychological and emotional needs at this current juncture in the post-separation period. however, a shared care arrangement should not be ruled out in the future if the post-separation context settles. [the mother]’s mental health difficulties [59] notwithstanding [the mother]'s counselling in the post-separation period, she has not provided a psychological evaluation or report concerning her mental health. how much [the father]'s alleged behaviour has impacted [the mother]'s adjustment to the separation is difficult to determine objectively and, by its nature, is usually a subjective experience. if the matter proceeds, the court may wish to consider a psychological or psychiatric evaluation of the parties to determine their personality functioning, mental health difficulties, and the impact of these factors on their parenting capacity. the impact of the relocation on [the father’s] relationship with [the child] [60] the father]'s belief that the relocation will significantly diminish his relationship with [the child] and that [the child] will be psychologically and emotionally disadvantaged is somewhat borne out in the research and literature in this area. children in this cohort tend to do worse on a variety of psychosocial measures into adulthood than children whose parents stay closely located after separation. depression, anxiety, and poorer educational and physical health outcomes are identified in the meta-analytical studies of children in this category. [61] under [the mother]'s proposal, [the father]'s access to [the child]'s social, educational, and recreational lives would be significantly diminished from its current levels. he would lose the continuity and day-to-day intimacy with the child he currently enjoys. the subsequent reduction in his contact and proximity to [the child] would increase his risk of becoming peripheral in her life. her friendships, social and sporting connections would inevitably become centred on the [town e] area and her mother's life in general. resilience factors to relocation [62] resilience factors to the diminution of the relationship with the non-moving parent are identified as, the child's developmental stage at the time of relocation, the level of attachment formation to the non-moving parent, commitment of the moving parent to maintaining the relationship, and the frequency and duration of the time spent with the non-moving parent after relocation. [the child]’s development age and stage [63] [the child] is at an age and stage of cognitive development that enables her to maintain a construct of the relationship with her father over space and time. this capacity can be further enhanced by telephone, facetime and regular midweek contact. attachment formation to the parties [64] the interviews and observations reveal that [the child] has a secure attachment with both parties. she was able to move between them without any sign of anxiety or apprehension and was relaxed and at ease in the company of both parents. [the child]'s attachment profile with [the father] would act as a protective factor in ameliorating the potential negative impacts of a reduction in his time. [65] the history of the relationship identifies [the mother] as the primary attachment figure for [the child]. this relationship would provide a psychological and emotional scaffold around [the child]’s adjustment to the relocation. given [the child]'s attachment profile with her parents, it is unlikely that her resistance to the move would be maintained at its current levels when she was settled and established in her new environment. commitment of the moving parent to maintaining [the child]’s relationships [66] [the father] has enjoyed substantial time with [the child] from the outset of the separation. there is nothing in the interviews or affidavit material to suggest that [the mother] has engaged in restrictive gatekeeping practices. she has supported [the father]'s relationship with [the child] in the post-separation period. her motivations for moving appear to be existential in nature concerning a change in her friendships, a sense of alienation in the [town c] area, and closer proximity to extended family supports. the frequency and duration of the time spent with the non-moving parent [67] the research and literature show that children do better on various emotional and psychological measures into adulthood, where they have successfully maintained a secure and nurturing relationship with both parents. substantial time is usually required if both parents are to maintain and develop their relationships with the child. this is more likely to occur when parents stay closely located after separation. [68] notwithstanding the extra holiday time offered by [the mother], her proposal represents a significant reduction in time and proximity for [the father]. given that the travel time from [town c] to [town e] is approximately one hour and 30 minutes (in light traffic) extending [the father]'s weekend time to the commencement of school on monday would be feasible. the fatigue issue for [the child] would be minor, given it would only occur once a fortnight. further, mid-week catch-up time could be considered given [the father]'s work flexibility. [69] in conclusion, the relocation of children is amongst the most difficult and complex issues addressed in the family law context. the dilemmas go beyond the usual family law parameters and encompass existential matters concerning freedom of movement and the right of the parties to exercise autonomy over their lives. only the court has the forensic capacity and mandate to address the full range of issues in their entirety. the analysis and recommendations in this report seek to provide a psychological framework for the court's decision-making around the parties' proposals which is reflected in the dual recommendations below. recommendations the writer respectfully recommends the following: in the event the court rejects the relocation: a) the parties have equal shared parental responsibility. b) [the child] to live with [the mother]. c) [the father] to spend time with [the child] each alternate weekend from the conclusion of school on friday until the commencement of school on monday, and each alternate wednesday from the conclusion of school until the commencement of school on friday.

credit of the parties ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... (citations omitted)  ] first, we question the nature of the credit findings and, more importantly, the need for many, if not all, of them to have been made in the first place. [88] this case involved, as his honour found, competing co-parenting arrangements where it was effectively conceded by the father that the child would continue to live with her mother. equally crucial, the proposals for the time that the child should have with her father were not significantly disparate. [89] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (“carlson”) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case: as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. to deny significant limitations in the capacity to use assessment of the demeanour of a witness as an entirely reliable guide to his or her truthfulness would be to deny the existence of plausible liars, or those who may be timid, uncertain or unconvincing, but nevertheless truthful, in relating events. moderation in this respect is also called for when it is recognised that adverse credit findings in arriving at a decision at first instance may present a significant hurdle to legitimate rights of review of that decision on appeal. these observations apply with at least equal, if not greater, force in parenting proceedings such as these in this court where the decision does not bring an end to the litigants’ relationship. these parties are, and will remain, the parents of d and k and adverse credit findings in this decision carry the inherent risk that, rather than bringing an end to long-standing conflictual issues, they may be embraced as vindication for the pursuit of further conflict in the future. moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide. [90] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.
standard of proof  in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.

section 61da presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders.   when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. (2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or   family violence.   when the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order. (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.   the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
... section 65dac effect of parenting order that provides for shared parental responsibility (1) this section applies if, under a parenting order:   2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child, and (b) the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long-term issue in relation to the child.   the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long-term issue in relation to the child.   the order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons. (3) the order is taken to require each of those persons: (a) to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and   to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and   to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.

[75] section 60b has been significantly amended including by the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) act (2006) (cth) which inserted at the commencement of s 60b the words “the objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by...” these words do no more than reinforce the relationship between s 60b and s 60cc and put beyond doubt that in relation to how a court determines what is in a particular child’s best interests, the facultative provisions are ss 60ca and 60cc and (where it applies) s 65aa. these words do not operate so as to elevate the role of s 60b beyond that envisaged by wacando. the same must be said about the court’s ability to take into account “any other fact or circumstance” that the court thinks is relevant (s 60cc(3)(m)). thus, in its current form, s 60b does no more than provide context, indicate the legislative intention or purpose of the part and otherwise operate as an aid to construction of the part and the act. it follows that we do not agree that the current s 60b can be used to change the ordinary and clear meaning of s 60cc or that where the s 60cc deliberations do not enable the court to determine whether or not a parenting order is in a child’s best interests, s 60b may be decisive. 76] the fact that at least one of the s 60b objects (s 60b(1)(b)) is replicated in s 60cc (s 60cc(2)(b)) reinforces the point that only one is facultative. [77] our interpretation is consistent with the manner in which subsequent to the 2006 amendments, seminal authorities such as goode v goode (2006) flc 9 3-286 and aldridge v keaton have approached part vii. the point being that the legislative pathway for the determination of applications for parenting orders is, as described in [82] of goode, that the court: considers the matters in s 60cc that are relevant, decides whether the presumption in s 61da that equal shared parental responsibility is in the best interests of the child applies, does not apply or it would be inappropriate to apply the presumption, if the presumption does apply, decides whether it is rebutted because application of it would not be in the child’s best interests, if the presumption applies and is not rebutted, consider making an order that the child spend equal time with the parents unless as a result of the application of s 60cc it is contrary to the child’s best interests, or impracticable, if equal time is found not to be in the child’s best interests, consider making an order that the child spend substantial and significant time with the parents, unless contrary to the child’s best interests as a result of consideration of one or more of the matters in s 60cc, or impracticable, if neither equal time nor substantial and significant time is considered to be in the best interests of the child, then making such orders that are in the best interests of the child, as a result of consideration of s 60cc, if the presumption is not applied or is rebutted, then making such order as is in the best interests of the child, as a result of consideration of one or more of the matters in s 60cc, and even then the court may need to consider equal time or substantial and significant time, especially if one of the parties has sought it or, even if neither has sought it, if the court considers after affording procedural fairness to the parties it to be in the best interests of the child.  9] the objects expressed in s 60b(1)(a) and (b) each find obvious reflection in the two “primary considerations” expressed in s 60cc(2) as follows: primary considerations (2) the primary considerations are: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. note: making these considerations the primary ones is consistent with the objects of this part set out in paragraphs 60b(1)(a) and (b). [110] section 15aa of the acts interpretation act 1901 (cth) provides: 15aa interpretation best achieving act’s purpose or object in interpreting a provision of an act, the interpretation that would best achieve the purpose or object of the act (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the act) is to be preferred to each other interpretation. ... [112] it follows that s 15aa (and equivalent provisions in state legislation) do not permit a court to ignore the actual words of a statute and a court is bound to give effect to clear language in a statute even if in the court’s opinion the result might be anomalous or unfair. [113] in this context there is ample authority for the general principle that courts are not at liberty to consider any word or sentence in legislation as superfluous or insignificant. prima facie, all words in a statute must be given some meaning and effect. [114] that principle has been held to be more compelling if the words or phrases used in the legislation have been added by amendment. in this respect it is instructive that within the amendments referred to (for example compare s 60b(2)(a) with (b)) there is a plain distinction even within the section between “parents” on the one hand, and “other people” on the other.   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  ] also as discussed in goode, the amending act introduced changes to the objects provision (s 60b(1) and the principles underpinning the objects (s 60b(2)). the objects and principles in s 60b “provide the context in which the factors in s 60cc are to be examined, weighed and applied in the individual case” (see goode at paragraph 10). section 60b(1)(a) is in the following terms:   the objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by: (a) ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, ... [our emphasis]   ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, ... [our emphasis]
... [108] we think it logical to examine the second major issue raised in this appeal by commencing our discussion with our consideration of s 60b and s 60cc(2)(a). sections 60b(1)(a), s 60b(2)(a) and (b) and s 60cc(2)(a) provide respectively:
section 60b (1) the objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by: (a) ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child,   ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child,
...
section 60b(2) (2) the principles underlying these objects are that (except when it is or would be contrary to a child's best interests): (a) children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives),   children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives),   children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives),
section 60cc(2) (2) the primary considerations are: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, ... [our emphasis]   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, ... [our emphasis]  9] the act does not contain a definition of “meaningful”, nor does it provide any specific criteria to assess how parents either have, or should have, a “meaningful involvement” in a child's life. it does not give guidance to the interpretation of the phrase “meaningful relationship”. [110] it is necessary we construe the language of the statute to determine whether the import of the legislation is clear without reference to extrinsic material. [111] the macquarie dictionary defines the adjective “meaningful” as “full of meaning, significant. significant is defined as “important, of consequence” [112] the shorter oxford english dictionary defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant ...” “significant” is defined as “having or conveying a meaning, expressive, suggesting or implying deeper or unstated meaning ... important, notable, consequential ...” [113] we turn first to the objects clause (s 60b(1)). the purpose of an objects clause is “to indicate the intended purpose of the legislation” (pearce, d c & geddes, r s, statutory interpretation in australia, 6th ed, lexis nexis, australia, 2006) the learned authors further note at 4.42... “objects clauses are used as an aid to the construction of words of legislation. gleeson cj referred to the legislative declarations of the objects of an act as giving practical content to abstract terms such as ‘reasonable’, ‘justification’ and ‘satisfactory’ in russo v aiello (2003) 215 clr 643 at 645”. [114] section 15aa of the acts interpretation act 1901 (cth) provides for a purposive construction of a statute. [115] the phrase “meaningful relationship” in the context of s 60cc(3)(a) has, not surprisingly, been considered in a number of decisions since the introduction of the amending act. in mazorski and albright [2007] famca 520, (2007) 37 fam lr 518 brown j, after setting out the definition of “meaningful” and “meaning”, said at paragraph 26:
what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.  6] kay j sitting in the appellate jurisdiction of the court as a single judge in godfrey and sanders (2007) famca 102 (an appeal involving an application by a mother to relocate) agreed with dessau j's exposition in m and s (formerly e) [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 of the effect of the amending act and said at paragraph 33:
the act sets out in s 60cc several matters for the court to consider in determining what is in the child's best interests but does not seek to mandate that any one or other matter becomes determinative in any particular case. for the purposes of this case the legislation requires that there be a primary consideration given to the benefit of the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents but it does not purport to prescribe how that meaningful relationship is best promoted in the circumstances of any one case.
and later at paragraph 36 said:
it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship. 7] bennett j discussed the terminology in g and c [2006] famca 994 and said the enquiry was a “prospective” one which requires a court to evaluate the extent to which a meaningful or significant relationship with both parents is going to be of advantage a child. ... [119] we conclude that the preferred interpretation of benefit to a child of a meaningful relationship in s 60cc(2)(a) is “the prospective approach” although, depending upon factual circumstances, the present relationship approach may also be relevant. we note however that s 60cc(3)(b) requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and his or her parents and other persons, including grandparents. if the interpretation we have set out in (a) above were exclusively applied, that interpretation would limit a court making appropriate orders in circumstances where a significant relationship had not been established between a child and a parent at the date of trial. ... [121] in coming to our conclusions we accept as appropriate the interpretation of “meaningful relationship” set out by brown j in mazsorski. consistently with our conclusions we also agree with the reasoning of bennett j in g & c. [emphasis added]  ] as another example, the principle of legality “requires that statutes be construed, where constructional choices are open, to avoid or minimise their encroachment upon rights and freedoms at common law” (momcilovic v the queen (2011) 245 clr 1 per french cj at [43]). [20] the law is not limited to the express words of the statute. [21] in relation to the present issue kirby j explained it in ams v aif: secondly, it is important to remember that in australia, whilst the welfare (or best interests) of the child are, by statute, the “paramount” consideration in the exercise of jurisdiction such as was invoked here, they are not the sole consideration. in this respect, the position in this country is different from that in canada. it more closely conforms to the language of the convention on the rights of the child. statutory instructions as to the paramountcy that is to be accorded to the child’s welfare or best interests are to be understood as they apply to a child living in australian society, normally in relationship with both parents and other members of its family. whilst the legislation considered in this case, and later statutory reforms, give the highest priority to the child’s welfare and best interests, that consideration does not expel every other relevant interest from receiving its due weight. in part, this is because (as the english courts recognised long ago) the enjoyment by parents of their freedoms necessarily impinges on the happiness of the child. but, in part, it is also because legislation such as fla 1975 and fca 1975 is enacted to take effect within a society of a particular character whose members enjoy a high measure of personal freedom, diminished only to the extent that the law obliges. (footnotes omitted)  ] before dealing with these grounds of appeal individually, it is worthwhile recalling the statements of principle proscribing the power to make orders which are, in effect, mandatory injunctions, forcing parents to live in places against their will so as to fulfil the statutory mandate to accord paramount importance to the children's best interests. [27] there is an inherent tension between, on the one hand, separated parents being able to establish new homes wherever they like and, on the other, their restraint by injunction from living too far apart to avoid any impingement of their children's ability to retain meaningful relationships with both parents. the conflict is between the best interests of the children to know and have regular personal contact with each parent and the interests of the parents to enjoy a high measure of freedom of movement which is not lost by reason only of their parental responsibility for the children (see ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 (“ams v aif”) at 196, 206, 207-208, 210). the tension at the intersection of those conflicting interests is even greater when an order is sought, not just to restrain one parent's move further away, but to compel the parent who has already moved away to return and establish a new residence closer to the other parent. [28] while the children's interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii of the act (ams v aif at 207, 225, 230, u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 ("u v u") at 282). parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children (see ams v aif at 223-224, 231-232, sampson and hartnett (no.10) [2007] famca 1365, (2007) flc 93-350, zanda & zanda [2014] famcafc 173, (2014) flc 93-607 at [132]- [136]). only when the children's welfare would be adversely affected must a parent's right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children's best interests (see u v u at 262).  ] it must be remembered that the family law act 1975 (cth), (“the act”) does not obligate a court to ensure a child maintains a meaningful relationship with both parents: mulvaney & lane [2009] famcafc 76, (2009) flc 93-404 at [89]. rather, the court must consider the benefit to a child of having such relationships. with respect to his honour, notwithstanding what was said in the mother’s papers, we do not consider he was in a position at the outset of the trial to form even a “preliminary” view concerning what benefit there might be to the child having a “meaningful relationship” with the father, or how that benefit ought be weighed with the many other factors the act requires be taken into account. ... [100] although we recognise kirby j was in the minority in the outcome in u v u, we nevertheless would adopt the following passage from his reasons: ... treating the wife's refusal to abandon her child and her expression of willingness (if necessary) to stay with the child in australia as an ‘alternative proposal’ requires, in effect, that parent to show ‘good’ or ‘compelling’ reasons to relocate, given that doing so will always make it more difficult (and in some cases virtually impossible) for physical contact between the other parent and the child to be maintained. such an approach stacks the cards unfairly against the custodial/residence parent ... ... [104] the only proper finding on the evidence here was that the mother did not “contemplate” living in perth any more than the father “contemplated” living in [town d]. it was therefore impermissible for the acting magistrate to proceed on the basis that the mother was “prepared” to continue living in perth. this does not necessarily mean that his honour could not make an order which assumed the mother’s continuing residence in perth. but just as that option was potentially available (if the mother’s primary proposal was not in the child’s best interests), then the option of making an order assuming the father’s capacity to move to [town d] was also available (presuming the father’s proposal to take on the full-time care of the child was not in her best interests). [105] we accept, as was said by gummow and callinan jj in u v u at [80] and [72] that “the court is not, on any view, bound by the proposals of the parties” and that “the parties in cases concerning the welfare of children do not define the issues”. however, as hayne j said in the same case (with the concurrence of gleeson cj and mchugh j): that is not to say that the family court is to embark upon some roving inquiry about the matter, unfettered by any regard for the evidence led and the matters which the parties seek to contest. due account must be taken of the fact that proceedings in the family court are conducted in a framework of adversarial procedure familiar to the common law. (i do not stay to consider how or to what extent that adversarial model has been modified by the act or rules of court made under it.) [106] having quoted this passage from u v u, the full court in d and sv [2003] famca 280, (2003) flc 93-137 said: even allowing for the caveat in the last sentence cited from hayne j, the court cannot manufacture an alternative proposal with respect to residence when one does not exist.  ] it is a now well established principle that, whilst some special requirements may apply, relocation cases are guided and judicial officers bound by the same legislative pathways as other parenting cases under the act. in other words, relocation is not to be treated as a discrete issue in the making of parenting orders (see morgan and miles [2007] famca 1230, (2007) flc 93-343 at paragraphs 72 to 73, palmer & hammer (no 2) [2011] famcafc 196 at paragraph 28). [48] a requirement in relocation cases is that judges faced with a parent wanting to relocate must consider the competing proposals of both parents (see palmer & hammer (no 2) paragraph 76, morgan and miles paragraphs 80 to 81). it is not simply a matter of comparing the relocating party’s proposal against the status quo and allowing or denying relocation. rather the court must consider each party’s proposal on its merits, in accordance with the prescribed legislative pathway. [49] the provisions of the act which form that legislative pathway have been reproduced at length by this court many times (taylor v barker [2007] fam ca 1236, (2007) 37 fam lr 461, morgan and miles (supra), adams & randall [2011] famcafc 204, (2011) flc 93-482). it is sufficient for current purposes to identify and summarise those sections contained in part vii of the act which govern decisions about children, and consider statements of the high court and of this court which guide their application in the context of relocation cases: section 60b – objects of part and principles underlying it section 60ca – child’s best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order section 60cc – how a court determines what is in a child’s best interests considerations relevant to relocation include: primary considerations: meaningful relationship with both parents additional considerations: nature of child’s relationship with parents and other persons extent to which parent has taken or failed to take opportunity to participate in decision-making, spend time and communicate likely effect of changes in child’s circumstances including effect on child of any separation from either parent, other child or other person with whom they have been living practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time and communication with a parent and whether that will substantially affect child’s right to maintain personal relations with both parents on a regular basis capacity of each parent and any other person to provide for the needs of the child section 61da – presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders section 65daa – court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances (where an order for equal shared parental responsibility has been made, and such time is in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable) subsection 65daa (5) – factors the court must have regard to in determining reasonable practicability: (a) how far apart parents live (b) parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for equal or substantial and significant time (c) parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing arrangements (d) impact arrangements would have on the child (e) such other matters the court considers relevant. [50] the legislation therefore requires multiple layers of consideration, but does not provide express guidance as to the order in which such matters are to be considered, or what weight is to be attached, other than to commence with the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and what follows from that decision. [51] the operation of the legislation in relocation cases has been expressly considered by the high court in mrr v gr (2010) 240 clr 461, an appeal from an order of a federal magistrate refusing to allow relocation. in joint reasons for judgment, the court (french cj, gummow, hayne, kiefel and bell jj) summarised the effect of the legislation and concluded that orders for equal or substantial and significant time are to be guided by the practical feasibility of such time, not merely its desirability....
if a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, the court must: (a) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (b) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (b) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.
... (c) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (d) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.”   consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (d) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.”   consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.”   if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.”  ] it is well settled that a trial judge must consider the competing proposals of the parties in accordance with the legislative pathway (sayer v radcliffe [2012] famcafc 209, (2012) 48 fam lr 298 at [48] (“sayer”)). at [49] of sayer, the full court summarises that legislative pathway which must, naturally, include a consideration of s 65daa(5) of the act.

matter referred to at (e) was not a live possibility at the end of the trial. however more significant is that, as ground 1 contends, it does not comply with the strictures of s 65daa, particularly as raised by the evidence. [18] the course of consideration required by s 65daa is indeed, as its language suggests, mandatory, and parties cannot by their conduct, absolve the court from adherence to its requirements: sayer v radcliffe [2012] famcafc 209, (2012) 48 fam lr 298 (somewhat ironically, an authority referred to by her honour at [21]). [19] in heaton v heaton [2012] famcafc 139, (2012) 48 fam lr 349 (“heaton”) at [37]–[38] the full court said: we regretfully conclude that his honour erred in his determination of the issue of equal shared time. by conflating the disparate issues of “best interests” and “reasonable practicability” the federal magistrate’s reasons for judgment do not demonstrate substantive, if not formal, adherence to the legislative pathway. as is apparent from a reading of them, with respect to his honour, his consideration of each issue was vitiated by its dependence upon conclusions or assumptions with respect to the other issue. his honour was required to first consider whether equal time was in the children’s best interests pursuant to s 60cc. if he concluded that it was, it was then necessary to consider the parties’ competing proposals and determine whether equal time was reasonably practicable. he did not do this. these errors are such that the appeal must succeed. as the high court said in mrr v gr [(2010) 240 clr 461], the determination of both of the questions in s 65daa(1) provide the source of jurisdictional power to make the order to which the section refers. it is not sufficient to argue that although his honour’s findings do not follow that “pathway” when read as a whole, inferentially, it may be said that he made the determinations required of him in s 65daa.
