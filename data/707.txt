i am strongly of the view that both parents are capable, diligent and responsible parents and each can separately meet [x’s] needs, including managing and monitoring his diet and other health needs. there is no indication that the father is or has been negligent with respect to [x’s] health.
furthermore, i am not prepared to share my child with other members of [mr fabina’s] family and would only agree to extensions of time that accommodate [x’s] bonding with his father. it would not be fair to me, as [x’s] mother and primary carer, if [x] is looked after by someone other than his father during [mr fabina’s] time.
that passage was put to the mother by ms treherne during cross examination and she was asked if that was still her view, to which the mother responded “no.” the mother indicated that she was now perfectly prepared to have the paternal grandmother collect the child from school and after school care. the mother also confirmed that she did not consider that the paternal grandfather presented any risk whatsoever to the child and confirmed that she would have no hesitation in leaving the child in the paternal grandfather’s care.   manalo] has always taken care of [x’s] physical needs. she is an attentive mother who will fight tirelessly if she thinks her son isn’t getting the attention he needs or deserves.
you don’t want to go to mummy, do you [x]? yeah i know! i wouldn’t want to go to her either” and “i know [x], you don’t want to go to mummy. i understand why. i don’t want you to go!
during cross examination the father agreed that he had said these words and when asked if he thought it was an appropriate thing to say in the child’s presence he responded, “yes. i never want him to go.” i then said to the father, “you do not want him to go, of course. but do you see that it is inappropriate to say so when x can hear you?” to which the father responded, “yes, i see.” i then said to the father, “you said a moment ago that it wasn’t appropriate thing to say,” to which the father responded “i see it now.”
the evidence of dr d
i was most disturbed to observe the mother speak openly and negatively about the father in the presence of [x] and to reference topics of conflict that were entirely unsuitable for a child.   his parents separated when he was an infant and it appears that he has been exposed to increasing conflict between the parents. x has had a very strong attachment relationship with his paternal grandparents, with whom he lived when he was an infant...i am strongly of the view that both parents are capable, diligent and responsible parents and each can separately meet x’s needs, including managing and monitoring his diet and other health needs. there is no indication that the father is or has been negligent with respect to x’s health. [1] (b) regrettably, despite their individual capabilities, i think that x is being exposed to increasing conflict between his parents...i think that x is heightened, sensitive and well aware of the conflict between his parents and that it is beginning to have an adverse effect on him, such as him becoming emotional at transition points. if the parents cannot rectify this situation, he will be at risk of a range of developmental, behavioural and psychological difficulties.[2] (c) in my view x has developed a positive, secure, and significant attachment relationship with mr fabina. although they have spent limited time together since separation, on observation, x appeared to be relaxed, at ease, playful and comforted in the care of his father. i observed that x sought proximity to mr fabina and sought physical affection and interaction. in fact, throughout the observation session, x sought to capture his father’s attention and mr fabina was kind and tender in his responses to x.[3] (d) i also observed that x had a strong connection with each of his paternal grandparents, although i would say that this was eclipsed by the connection he had with his father....i think that x has a very strong, significant, and sound emotional attachment to both his paternal grandparents...i also observed that x had a very strong emotional and loving connection with his paternal grandmother.[4] (e) i think that x has a strong, close and intense attachment relationship with his mother. x appeared to be familiar and comfortable with this mother and ms manalo appeared to care deeply for her son and dote on him, giving him attention and appropriate interaction.[5] (f) i also think that x is very close to his mother and sensitive and attuned to her reactions and responses. if the mother is able to role model appropriate emotional regulation and interpersonal relationship skills, then x will experience a solid capacity to manage his own emotions and cope with stress. on the other hand, if the mother exposes x to poor emotional regulation and hostile or aggressive interactions with others, he will be vulnerable to having his own problems with self-regulation and relationship conflicts. this is particularly acute because x is an only child and has an intense attachment relationship with his mother.[6] (g) at the time of this assessment, x was due to spend an extra period of time with his father. [the last progression of the 7 december 2020 interim orders by adding each alternate wednesday evening and full day thursday.] if this living arrangement were to continue, then i think that x would be able to maintain positive attachment relationships with all his family members. however, i do not think that in the long-term, if the time that x spends with his father does not progress beyond the current arrangement, then x will begin to resent the limitations on the time with his father. in my view x clearly loves his father, feels a strong bond in connection with him and seeks his attention and affection. i observed that x was reluctant to leave his father’s care, although was reassured when finding out that he would be seeing his father on the following day. i would also be concerned in the long-term with an arrangement where the father was not involved in the more routine aspects of x’s care, such as preparing him for preschool and school, taking him to his extracurricular activities and being involved in his medical and other care. x needs to know that both parents are trustworthy capable adults who exercised the normal parental responsibilities for him and who are capable of competent care. i am concerned that if the parenting arrangement does not allow for x to spend more time with his father across a range of activities, then x may partition in his own mind the different roles of each of his parents. i think that over time x may become resentful about this and in fact may blame his mother for the more limited time that he is spending with his father. [7] (h) the mother’s proposal is for a continuation of the status quo. it is her view that she is the parent who is better to manage x’s medical needs and it is for this reason that his time with his father should be limited. there is nothing in the material available to me or in the interviews are [sic] observations i conducted that suggests that the father is not entirely capable of caring for x’s medical needs.[8] (i) the father’s current proposal represents a complete reversal of the current living arrangements in so far as the father proposes that x lived primarily with him and spend time with his mother, one afternoon each week, and three nights per fortnight. the father proposes that in the alternative, that x spend a “week about” arrangement with each parent. in respect of the first proposal, i think that this would cause x a disruption to his only known pattern of care of living with his mother, who has been his primary carer. although he is developing a good capacity to separate will from his mother or more extended periods of time, and only 4 years of age, this proposal is a radical departure for x and would, in my view cause him significant distress. i do not think that he currently has the maturity to cope with such a sudden and lengthy separation from his mother without suffering from anxiety and separation distress. with respect to the second/alternative proposal, that x spend equal time between his parents, i also think that this would have some developmental challenges for x, at least in the first instance...i also do not think that he has the requisite maturity to suddenly shift to a pattern of being separated from his mother for 7 consecutive nights. having said that, i also think that over the next 12 – 18 months, x could develop an appropriate capacity to separate from his mother for more extended periods of time, provided that this occurred in a graduated, step -wise progression of time.[9] (j) i think that the mother has a mixed capacity to provide for x’s needs. on the one hand the mother has been vigilant and meticulous in attending to x’s health needs. she has devoted herself to ensuring that he has access to appropriate medical care and has researched various aspects of child development with a view to enhancing x’s developmental outcomes. the mother also appears to have provided x with a structure and organised household routine so that he has a good sense of predictability and structure. i also think that the mother loves x and intends the best for him. however, i think that the mother has a real lapse in her capacity to provide for x’s emotional needs. she has no understanding or capacity to accept the value and significance of x’s deep and meaningful connection with his father and paternal family. unfortunately, the mother has viewed these relationships as threatening, rather than enhancing x’s life and experience...regrettably, this failure of the mothers to understand x’s emotional connection to his father and paternal grandparents is, in my view, becoming transparent to x and will in time have an adverse effect on his emotional development.[10] (k) unfortunately...x has likely been exposed to the mother's inappropriate and hostile communication with others. this has a profound and negative effect on his own capacity to emotionally regulate. [11] (l) i think that the father has a very good capacity to provide for x and meet his needs, including his emotional and psychological needs...there was absolutely no indication that the father was negligent or lack detention or care to x’s needs, although he disagrees with the mother as to how to approach his diet. my reading of the material indicates that the father has sought to be involved in x’s medical care, has sought appropriate referrals for him and his diligent in his care of x.[12] (m) the mother has a very poorly developed capacity to facilitate x’s meaningful relationship with the father and paternal family. [here dr d made reference to the paragraph from the mother’s earlier affidavit quoted in the father’s first affidavit set out at paragraph 53 of these reasons] with respect to the father, i think that he has a good capacity to facilitate x’s relationship with his mother. overall, i think that the father and the paternal family have a very good capacity and willingness to facilitate x’s relationship with the mother. .[13] (n) at nearly 4 years of age, x is developing a more robust capacity to separate from each of his parents, without undue distress or disruption to his emotional development. this is compounded by the fact that x has been attending long-day care for several years and has developed the daily practice of forming attachment bonds with other adult caregivers and other children. having said that, he still does not have the requisite emotional maturity or cognitive capacity to cope with more extended periods of time away from either of his parents. i think that this is particularly so in the case of his mother. at the time of writing this report, x and only commenced spending overnight time away from his mother for 6 months. he appears to be coping very well with this and the time is about to progress. however, i think that at the current time, dramatic increases in time away from his mother, particularly involving multiple consecutive nights away, may lead to some aggressive behaviours and anxiety for x.[14] (o) i think that x is an astute, observant, and intelligent young child. he is highly aware of his parents’ animosity and it is beginning to have an adverse emotional effect on him. i think that x is beginning to feel responsible for his parents’ conflict.[15] (p) i am strongly of the view that the mother has no intention of facilitating a workable co-parenting relationship with the father the mother perceives herself as x’s authoritative parent and the father as peripheral to decision-making and foundational aspects of his care. i think that the mother has a challenging personality in so far as she may interpret others’ different views as threatening or invalidating her. she presents as emotionally overwhelmed with a tendency to regard herself as a victim. in reality, the mother is intelligent, resourceful, well-educated and highly capable. if the parents are to exercise joint parental responsibility, i think that they will need professional assistance to communicate and resolve matters of significance.[16]   regrettably, despite their individual capabilities, i think that x is being exposed to increasing conflict between his parents...i think that x is heightened, sensitive and well aware of the conflict between his parents and that it is beginning to have an adverse effect on him, such as him becoming emotional at transition points. if the parents cannot rectify this situation, he will be at risk of a range of developmental, behavioural and psychological difficulties.[2] (c) in my view x has developed a positive, secure, and significant attachment relationship with mr fabina. although they have spent limited time together since separation, on observation, x appeared to be relaxed, at ease, playful and comforted in the care of his father. i observed that x sought proximity to mr fabina and sought physical affection and interaction. in fact, throughout the observation session, x sought to capture his father’s attention and mr fabina was kind and tender in his responses to x.[3] (d) i also observed that x had a strong connection with each of his paternal grandparents, although i would say that this was eclipsed by the connection he had with his father....i think that x has a very strong, significant, and sound emotional attachment to both his paternal grandparents...i also observed that x had a very strong emotional and loving connection with his paternal grandmother.[4] (e) i think that x has a strong, close and intense attachment relationship with his mother. x appeared to be familiar and comfortable with this mother and ms manalo appeared to care deeply for her son and dote on him, giving him attention and appropriate interaction.[5] (f) i also think that x is very close to his mother and sensitive and attuned to her reactions and responses. if the mother is able to role model appropriate emotional regulation and interpersonal relationship skills, then x will experience a solid capacity to manage his own emotions and cope with stress. on the other hand, if the mother exposes x to poor emotional regulation and hostile or aggressive interactions with others, he will be vulnerable to having his own problems with self-regulation and relationship conflicts. this is particularly acute because x is an only child and has an intense attachment relationship with his mother.[6] (g) at the time of this assessment, x was due to spend an extra period of time with his father.

[the last progression of the 7 december 2020 interim orders by adding each alternate wednesday evening and full day thursday.] if this living arrangement were to continue, then i think that x would be able to maintain positive attachment relationships with all his family members. however, i do not think that in the long-term, if the time that x spends with his father does not progress beyond the current arrangement, then x will begin to resent the limitations on the time with his father. in my view x clearly loves his father, feels a strong bond in connection with him and seeks his attention and affection. i observed that x was reluctant to leave his father’s care, although was reassured when finding out that he would be seeing his father on the following day. i would also be concerned in the long-term with an arrangement where the father was not involved in the more routine aspects of x’s care, such as preparing him for preschool and school, taking him to his extracurricular activities and being involved in his medical and other care. x needs to know that both parents are trustworthy capable adults who exercised the normal parental responsibilities for him and who are capable of competent care. i am concerned that if the parenting arrangement does not allow for x to spend more time with his father across a range of activities, then x may partition in his own mind the different roles of each of his parents. i think that over time x may become resentful about this and in fact may blame his mother for the more limited time that he is spending with his father. [7] (h) the mother’s proposal is for a continuation of the status quo. it is her view that she is the parent who is better to manage x’s medical needs and it is for this reason that his time with his father should be limited. there is nothing in the material available to me or in the interviews are [sic] observations i conducted that suggests that the father is not entirely capable of caring for x’s medical needs.[8] (i) the father’s current proposal represents a complete reversal of the current living arrangements in so far as the father proposes that x lived primarily with him and spend time with his mother, one afternoon each week, and three nights per fortnight. the father proposes that in the alternative, that x spend a “week about” arrangement with each parent. in respect of the first proposal, i think that this would cause x a disruption to his only known pattern of care of living with his mother, who has been his primary carer. although he is developing a good capacity to separate will from his mother or more extended periods of time, and only 4 years of age, this proposal is a radical departure for x and would, in my view cause him significant distress. i do not think that he currently has the maturity to cope with such a sudden and lengthy separation from his mother without suffering from anxiety and separation distress. with respect to the second/alternative proposal, that x spend equal time between his parents, i also think that this would have some developmental challenges for x, at least in the first instance...i also do not think that he has the requisite maturity to suddenly shift to a pattern of being separated from his mother for 7 consecutive nights. having said that, i also think that over the next 12 – 18 months, x could develop an appropriate capacity to separate from his mother for more extended periods of time, provided that this occurred in a graduated, step -wise progression of time.[9] (j) i think that the mother has a mixed capacity to provide for x’s needs. on the one hand the mother has been vigilant and meticulous in attending to x’s health needs. she has devoted herself to ensuring that he has access to appropriate medical care and has researched various aspects of child development with a view to enhancing x’s developmental outcomes. the mother also appears to have provided x with a structure and organised household routine so that he has a good sense of predictability and structure. i also think that the mother loves x and intends the best for him. however, i think that the mother has a real lapse in her capacity to provide for x’s emotional needs. she has no understanding or capacity to accept the value and significance of x’s deep and meaningful connection with his father and paternal family. unfortunately, the mother has viewed these relationships as threatening, rather than enhancing x’s life and experience...regrettably, this failure of the mothers to understand x’s emotional connection to his father and paternal grandparents is, in my view, becoming transparent to x and will in time have an adverse effect on his emotional development.[10] (k) unfortunately...x has likely been exposed to the mother's inappropriate and hostile communication with others. this has a profound and negative effect on his own capacity to emotionally regulate.

with the mother. .[13] (n) at nearly 4 years of age, x is developing a more robust capacity to separate from each of his parents, without undue distress or disruption to his emotional development. this is compounded by the fact that x has been attending long-day care for several years and has developed the daily practice of forming attachment bonds with other adult caregivers and other children. having said that, he still does not have the requisite emotional maturity or cognitive capacity to cope with more extended periods of time away from either of his parents. i think that this is particularly so in the case of his mother. at the time of writing this report, x and only commenced spending overnight time away from his mother for 6 months. he appears to be coping very well with this and the time is about to progress. however, i think that at the current time, dramatic increases in time away from his mother, particularly involving multiple consecutive nights away, may lead to some aggressive behaviours and anxiety for x.[14] (o) i think that x is an astute, observant, and intelligent young child. he is highly aware of his parents’ animosity and it is beginning to have an adverse emotional effect on him. i think that x is beginning to feel responsible for his parents’ conflict.[15] (p) i am strongly of the view that the mother has no intention of facilitating a workable co-parenting relationship with the father the mother perceives herself as x’s authoritative parent and the father as peripheral to decision-making and foundational aspects of his care. i think that the mother has a challenging personality in so far as she may interpret others’ different views as threatening or invalidating her. she presents as emotionally overwhelmed with a tendency to regard herself as a victim. in reality, the mother is intelligent, resourceful, well-educated and highly capable. if the parents are to exercise joint parental responsibility, i think that they will need professional assistance to communicate and resolve matters of significance.[16]   the mother’s proposal is for a continuation of the status quo. it is her view that she is the parent who is better to manage x’s medical needs and it is for this reason that his time with his father should be limited. there is nothing in the material available to me or in the interviews are [sic] observations i conducted that suggests that the father is not entirely capable of caring for x’s medical needs.[8] (i) the father’s current proposal represents a complete reversal of the current living arrangements in so far as the father proposes that x lived primarily with him and spend time with his mother, one afternoon each week, and three nights per fortnight. the father proposes that in the alternative, that x spend a “week about” arrangement with each parent. in respect of the first proposal, i think that this would cause x a disruption to his only known pattern of care of living with his mother, who has been his primary carer. although he is developing a good capacity to separate will from his mother or more extended periods of time, and only 4 years of age, this proposal is a radical departure for x and would, in my view cause him significant distress. i do not think that he currently has the maturity to cope with such a sudden and lengthy separation from his mother without suffering from anxiety and separation distress. with respect to the second/alternative proposal, that x spend equal time between his parents, i also think that this would have some developmental challenges for x, at least in the first instance...i also do not think that he has the requisite maturity to suddenly shift to a pattern of being separated from his mother for 7 consecutive nights. having said that, i also think that over the next 12 – 18 months, x could develop an appropriate capacity to separate from his mother for more extended periods of time, provided that this occurred in a graduated, step -wise progression of time.[9] (j) i think that the mother has a mixed capacity to provide for x’s needs. on the one hand the mother has been vigilant and meticulous in attending to x’s health needs. she has devoted herself to ensuring that he has access to appropriate medical care and has researched various aspects of child development with a view to enhancing x’s developmental outcomes. the mother also appears to have provided x with a structure and organised household routine so that he has a good sense of predictability and structure. i also think that the mother loves x and intends the best for him. however, i think that the mother has a real lapse in her capacity to provide for x’s emotional needs. she has no understanding or capacity to accept the value and significance of x’s deep and meaningful connection with his father and paternal family. unfortunately, the mother has viewed these relationships as threatening, rather than enhancing x’s life and experience...regrettably, this failure of the mothers to understand x’s emotional connection to his father and paternal grandparents is, in my view, becoming transparent to x and will in time have an adverse effect on his emotional development.[10] (k) unfortunately...x has likely been exposed to the mother's inappropriate and hostile communication with others. this has a profound and negative effect on his own capacity to emotionally regulate. [11] (l) i think that the father has a very good capacity to provide for x and meet his needs, including his emotional and psychological needs...there was absolutely no indication that the father was negligent or lack detention or care to x’s needs, although he disagrees with the mother as to how to approach his diet. my reading of the material indicates that the father has sought to be involved in x’s medical care, has sought appropriate referrals for him and his diligent in his care of x.[12] (m) the mother has a very poorly developed capacity to facilitate x’s meaningful relationship with the father and paternal family. [here dr d made reference to the paragraph from the mother’s earlier affidavit quoted in the father’s first affidavit set out at paragraph 53 of these reasons] with respect to the father, i think that he has a good capacity to facilitate x’s relationship with his mother. overall, i think that the father and the paternal family have a very good capacity and willingness to facilitate x’s relationship with the mother. .[13] (n) at nearly 4 years of age, x is developing a more robust capacity to separate from each of his parents, without undue distress or disruption to his emotional development. this is compounded by the fact that x has been attending long-day care for several years and has developed the daily practice of forming attachment bonds with other adult caregivers and other children. having said that, he still does not have the requisite emotional maturity or cognitive capacity to cope with more extended periods of time away from either of his parents. i think that this is particularly so in the case of his mother. at the time of writing this report, x and only commenced spending overnight time away from his mother for 6 months. he appears to be coping very well with this and the time is about to progress. however, i think that at the current time, dramatic increases in time away from his mother, particularly involving multiple consecutive nights away, may lead to some aggressive behaviours and anxiety for x.[14] (o) i think that x is an astute, observant, and intelligent young child. he is highly aware of his parents’ animosity and it is beginning to have an adverse emotional effect on him. i think that x is beginning to feel responsible for his parents’ conflict.[15] (p) i am strongly of the view that the mother has no intention of facilitating a workable co-parenting relationship with the father the mother perceives herself as x’s authoritative parent and the father as peripheral to decision-making and foundational aspects of his care. i think that the mother has a challenging personality in so far as she may interpret others’ different views as threatening or invalidating her. she presents as emotionally overwhelmed with a tendency to regard herself as a victim. in reality, the mother is intelligent, resourceful, well-educated and highly capable. if the parents are to exercise joint parental responsibility, i think that they will need professional assistance to communicate and resolve matters of significance.[16]   the father’s current proposal represents a complete reversal of the current living arrangements in so far as the father proposes that x lived primarily with him and spend time with his mother, one afternoon each week, and three nights per fortnight. the father proposes that in the alternative, that x spend a “week about” arrangement with each parent. in respect of the first proposal, i think that this would cause x a disruption to his only known pattern of care of living with his mother, who has been his primary carer. although he is developing a good capacity to separate will from his mother or more extended periods of time, and only 4 years of age, this proposal is a radical departure for x and would, in my view cause him significant distress. i do not think that he currently has the maturity to cope with such a sudden and lengthy separation from his mother without suffering from anxiety and separation distress. with respect to the second/alternative proposal, that x spend equal time between his parents, i also think that this would have some developmental challenges for x, at least in the first instance...i also do not think that he has the requisite maturity to suddenly shift to a pattern of being separated from his mother for 7 consecutive nights. having said that, i also think that over the next 12 – 18 months, x could develop an appropriate capacity to separate from his mother for more extended periods of time, provided that this occurred in a graduated, step -wise progression of time.[9] (j) i think that the mother has a mixed capacity to provide for x’s needs. on the one hand the mother has been vigilant and meticulous in attending to x’s health needs. she has

overall, i think that the court should consider [x] spending a graduated pattern of increased time with his father, staged in a developmentally appropriate manner. in practical terms, i think that by the time he has completed one term of formal schooling [the conclusion of term 1 2023] he would be able to manage spending time with his parents in a week about arrangement. if the parents are unable to exercise a functional pattern of communication regarding [x’s] needs, then i would recommend that the court consider sole parental responsibility to the father. ... i think that if the mother were to have sole parental responsibility for [x], she would exclude the father and continue to denigrate him and reinforce a perception [to [x]] that he is incompetent or uncaring. i think that this would have a detrimental impact on [x] and his overall well-being.
mr finch: do you have any concerns going forward that the mother will withhold medical information from the father? [dr d]: no. mr finch: is that because the mother is meticulous? [dr d]: yes. mr finch: she is vigilant in relation to third parties providing food to [x]? [dr d]: absolutely.
the law
a discretionary judgment concerning the parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[22]
section 60cc - the primary considerations ] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.  ] the act sets out in s 60cc several matters for the court to consider in determining what is in the child’s best interests but does not seek to mandate that any one or other matter becomes determinative in any particular case. for the purposes of this case the legislation requires that there be a primary consideration given to the benefit of the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents but it does not purport to prescribe how that meaningful relationship is best promoted in the circumstances of any one case. and later, at paragraph 36 said: [36] it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.

section 60cc – the additional considerations.
any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views.
the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and the paternal grandparents.
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, to spend time with the child, and to communicate with the child.
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child.
the likely effect of any changes in the child circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his parents.
the practical difficulty and expense of the child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis.
the capacity of each of the child’s parents and the paternal grandparents to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant.
the attitude to the child, and the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents.
any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family.
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child.
parental responsibility
if the parents are unable to exercise a functional pattern of communication regarding [x]’s needs, then i would recommend that the court consider sole parental responsibility to the father...i think that if the mother would have sole parental responsibility for [x], she would exclude the father and continue to denigrate him and reinforce a perception [to [x]] that he is incompetent or uncaring. i think that this would have a deleterious impact on [x] and his overall well-being.
consideration of section 65daa – care of the child by the parents
would have some developmental challenges for [x], at least in the first instance. ... i also do not think that he has the requisite maturity to suddenly shift to a pattern of being separated from his mother for 7 consecutive nights.
dr d does, however, expressed the opinion that after a lead in period of 12 to 18 months the child could develop an appropriate capacity to separate from his mother for more extended periods of time, provided that lead in period had graduated, step-wise progressions of time for the child with his father.   immediately each tuesday from 4:30pm until 7:30pm, extending to each tuesday from 3:30pm to 7:30pm once the child starts school in 2023, (b) each alternate wednesday at 4:30pm until the following friday at 4:30pm, changing to end of school on wednesday until end of school on friday once a child starts school in 2023, (c) each alternate weekend from the end of school on friday until the start of school on monday, and (d) following from this, from the start of school attendance for term three in 2023 such time will increase to being from the end of school on wednesday until the start of school the following tuesday each alternate week.   each alternate wednesday at 4:30pm until the following friday at 4:30pm, changing to end of school on wednesday until end of school on friday once a child starts school in 2023, (c) each alternate weekend from the end of school on friday until the start of school on monday, and (d) following from this, from the start of school attendance for term three in 2023 such time will increase to being from the end of school on wednesday until the start of school the following tuesday each alternate week.   each alternate weekend from the end of school on friday until the start of school on monday, and (d) following from this, from the start of school attendance for term three in 2023 such time will increase to being from the end of school on wednesday until the start of school the following tuesday each alternate week.   following from this, from the start of school attendance for term three in 2023 such time will increase to being from the end of school on wednesday until the start of school the following tuesday each alternate week.
