when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.

whether an order altering property interests should be made
the assessment of contributions
put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79.
in s & s at [42], the full court acknowledged it may be possible for the court to draw an inference that family violence perpetrated by one party to a marriage may impact upon the contributions that the other party was able to make to the property of the marriage. at [45], the full court, quoting kennon, said that inference must be “obvious” or “very likely” (emphasis added).
the full court, in benson & drury at 80,141 [18], made it clear that the evidence of the nature of violence perpetrated against the victim may be such that, even without expert evidence, a trial judge undertaking appropriate forensic analysis might infer that the violence had a discernible impact on the victim, such that it made the victim’s contributions “significantly more arduous” than they ought to have been.
the wife being present on two occasions when the husband threatens to take his life
“that she, on two occasions, was present with him during times when he took steps preparatory to take his own life, and threatened to do so. he was twice taken by police to hospital, suffering some sort of acute psychotic episode, it would seem.”
being struck at night in bed causing injury
causing distress
being subjected to demeaning and abusive conduct
being exposed to the husband’s mental health issues: depression, ptsd, auditory hallucinations
w: what do you want to talk about? is it about the money you took from me? h: no fuck off. my son’s money is in here w: what money? the 280,000 that’s been absorbed by our nearly 8 year relationship? there is no more of your son’s money [mr j]”
“he barged in and i headed towards the back kitchen. he followed me screaming, insulting me and threatening to kick me out of the house. he was screaming words the effect of ‘get the fuck out of my house”.[45]
post separation contributions
the approach taken ] ...established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties’ respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the post separation period to the point of assessment...

w said will just fill in the job diary because he has to but doesn’t believe he can actually any kind of job..... w said his capacity should be ‘unfit’ w said [transport work] is no good because of back pain
hi.. please respect the fact that i do not wish anyone to appear at the property before i move out... in respect to this i’ll be advising the court, for my personal space involved in the vacating of the property. i will be employing a legal representative within the next week. unfortunately, i still live here and have rights. you will be hearing from my new lawyer soon.”
we have sought to assist you by arranging for the agents to do preliminary inspections on the same day. as previously advised the agents will attend with [mr j’s] representative on tuesday, 2 november 2021 between the hours of 1 pm and 4 pm. would you kindly confirm you allow access to the property on tuesday, 2 november 2021 between a aproximately 1 pm and 4 pm for two real estate agents and [mr j’s] representative in accordance with the orders....”
