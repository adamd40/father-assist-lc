background facts  in 1976, the father was born in china and he is, currently, 46 years of age. (b) in 1979, the mother was born in china and she is, currently, 43 years of age. (c) in 2006, the father and the mother married in china. (d) in 2013, x was born and he is, currently, 9 years of age. (e) in 2014, y was born and he is, currently, 8 years of age. (f) in october 2014, the father and the mother separated. (g) on 29 march 2016, the mother initiated property and parenting proceedings. (h) on 27 july 2016, final property and parenting orders were made, by consent, by judge monahan. (i) in august 2016, the father provided x’s passport to the mother, in accordance with her request, to enable her to take him to china. (j) in january 2017, the father provided x’s passport to the mother, in accordance with her request, to enable her to take him to china, although the mother said that this request referred to y. (k) in april 2017, the father and the mother divorced. (l) on 10 may 2019, the father requested y’s passport, which was then held by the mother, as he sought to take y to china to see his aunt who was seriously ill. the mother agreed that the father made that request but disputed that he had provided her with information about his aunt. (m) on 11 may 2019, the mother did not provide y’s passport to the father. (n) on 5 july 2019, the mother commenced these proceedings. (o) on 24 july 2019, the court ordered that the parties attend a child dispute conference with a family consultant nominated by the then child dispute section in the sydney registry of this court on 26 november 2019. a memorandum arising from that conference was, ultimately, prepared by ms d (“ms d”) on 28 november 2019. (p) in september 2019, the father provided x’s passport to the mother, in accordance with her request, to enable her to take him to china. (q) on 7 november 2019, the mother filed an amended initiating application. (r) in early 2020, the father said that he requested y’s birth certificate to open a bank account for y in accordance with a school requirement but the mother failed to provide it. the mother agreed that she did not provide the birth certificate but maintained that the purpose for the father’s request was not disclosed to her. (s) between december 2019 and january 2020, the father travelled to china, where his father was undergoing a medical procedure and the children remained in the mother’s care. the father was also subjected to covid-19 travel restrictions while in china and upon his return to australia. the mother agreed that the children had remained with her but maintained that the father had provided her with no information about his circumstances in china. (t) on 17 february 2020, the children returned to live with the father. the father said that he had then learnt that the mother had taken y to see dr e who had diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“adhd”) and had prescribed him dexamphetamine. (u) on 1 december 2020, the family report of dr c dated 27 november 2020 was released to the parties, as referred to in paragraph 5, above. (v) the father has resided at f street, suburb g. within the last week (before the hearing), he moved to a temporary location at h street, suburb j as he proposed to relocate to a property at k street, suburb l (“the k street, suburb l property”) when its settlement was to be effected in late august/early september 2022. the mother called for a copy of the front page of the purchase contract which was provided by the father (see exhibit “court 4”) which confirmed that he was the sole purchaser of that property. the court accepts that the mother was unaware of the father’s location with the children at either suburb j or of his proposed relocation to the k street, suburb l property. (w) the father had graduated from a university in china and described his occupation as company manager but his employment appeared to be in the technology sector in partial charge of the technical aspects of technology. the father, initially, reported that he had moved away from the technology sector as it had long hours and did not fit with his childcare responsibilities. the father gave evidence that he was, now, hopeful of a promotion within his employment to become a retail manager, rather than being a manager of only part of the store. the father, initially, described his employment as flexible and it would appear that that flexibility enabled him to drop off the children at school at 9.00am and drive to his employment at around 10.00am and leave his employment at 2.30pm to collect the children from school. the father’s evidence was that, if he obtained a promotion, he would need to work more hours in the day which would be from 9.00am to 6.00pm, monday to friday. he also considered that this would be of assistance, given his acquisition of the k street, suburb l property for $2,480,000.00 (as confirmed in exhibit “court 4”). notwithstanding this, the court accepts from the father’s evidence that he also retains some continuing flexibility from his employment with, as he described it, a good relationship with the boss of the workplace. no evidence was called from the father’s employer. mr macdiarmid sought to challenge the father with respect to his evidence about his potential promotion and asserted that the same had only been raised to “better” the father’s position. the father denied that assertion. in that regard, the court is of the view that, even accepting the father’s evidence, it still remained unclear as to whether any change in his working hours would impact on his work flexibility into the future. (x) the mother completed a diploma and described her occupation as a carer at employer m in suburb n, working full-time hours, being 5 days per week between 9.00am and 5.00pm, but on a permanent/part-time basis, and noted that her hours varied so that if she was required to pick the children up earlier, she would work later and that she would work increased hours prior to school holiday periods so that she could spend school holiday time with the children. the mother confirmed that she earnt, approximately, $1,200.00 per fortnight after tax, being $31,200.00 per annum and her mortgage and associated (council and strata levies) expenses totalled $3,000.00 per month, being $36,000.00 per annum, without regard to her living expenses. (y) the mother lives in a one (1) bedroom unit that she owns, subject to a mortgage, situated at o street, suburb p, near location q. (z) the children attend r school. x is, currently, in year 4 and y is, currently, in year 3. (aa) the father had arranged for x to sit an opportunity class test on 28 july 2022. the father suggested that if x was offered an opportunity class placement, he would propose that x be enrolled in either s school, which he considered was his first preference or t school. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s application for an opportunity class placement but considered that, if x was offered such a placement, she would consider the same and that she may be agreeable to s school but would need further time to consider the same. the court accepts, given the uncertainty surrounding these matters that no orders should be made referrable to schooling issues, as referred to in paragraph 15, above. the court notes that the father, in his written submission, understood, given the order for equal shared parental responsibility, that no orders ought to be made about the school the children were to attend, now or into the future. that was an appropriate position to adopt and he is given credit, in that regard.   in 1979, the mother was born in china and she is, currently, 43 years of age. (c) in 2006, the father and the mother married in china. (d) in 2013, x was born and he is, currently, 9 years of age. (e) in 2014, y was born and he is, currently, 8 years of age. (f) in october 2014, the father and the mother separated. (g) on 29 march 2016, the mother initiated property and parenting proceedings. (h) on 27 july 2016, final property and parenting orders were made, by consent, by judge monahan. (i) in august 2016, the father provided x’s passport to the mother, in accordance with her request, to enable her to take him to china.

(s) between december 2019 and january 2020, the father travelled to china, where his father was undergoing a medical procedure and the children remained in the mother’s care. the father was also subjected to covid-19 travel restrictions while in china and upon his return to australia. the mother agreed that the children had remained with her but maintained that the father had provided her with no information about his circumstances in china. (t) on 17 february 2020, the children returned to live with the father. the father said that he had then learnt that the mother had taken y to see dr e who had diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“adhd”) and had prescribed him dexamphetamine. (u) on 1 december 2020, the family report of dr c dated 27 november 2020 was released to the parties, as referred to in paragraph 5, above. (v) the father has resided at f street, suburb g. within the last week (before the hearing), he moved to a temporary location at h street, suburb j as he proposed to relocate to a property at k street, suburb l (“the k street, suburb l property”) when its settlement was to be effected in late august/early september 2022. the mother called for a copy of the front page of the purchase contract which was provided by the father (see exhibit “court 4”) which confirmed that he was the sole purchaser of that property. the court accepts that the mother was unaware of the father’s location with the children at either suburb j or of his proposed relocation to the k street, suburb l property. (w) the father had graduated from a university in china and described his occupation as company manager but his employment appeared to be in the technology sector in partial charge of the technical aspects of technology. the father, initially, reported that he had moved away from the technology sector as it had long hours and did not fit with his childcare responsibilities. the father gave evidence that he was, now, hopeful of a promotion within his employment to become a retail manager, rather than being a manager of only part of the store. the father, initially, described his employment as flexible and it would appear that that flexibility enabled him to drop off the children at school at 9.00am and drive to his employment at around 10.00am and leave his employment at 2.30pm to collect the children from school. the father’s evidence was that, if he obtained a promotion, he would need to work more hours in the day which would be from 9.00am to 6.00pm, monday to friday. he also considered that this would be of assistance, given his acquisition of the k street, suburb l property for $2,480,000.00 (as confirmed in exhibit “court 4”). notwithstanding this, the court accepts from the father’s evidence that he also retains some continuing flexibility from his employment with, as he described it, a good relationship with the boss of the workplace. no evidence was called from the father’s employer. mr macdiarmid sought to challenge the father with respect to his evidence about his potential promotion and asserted that the same had only been raised to “better” the father’s position. the father denied that assertion. in that regard, the court is of the view that, even accepting the father’s evidence, it still remained unclear as to whether any change in his working hours would impact on his work flexibility into the future. (x) the mother completed a diploma and described her occupation as a carer at employer m in suburb n, working full-time hours, being 5 days per week between 9.00am and 5.00pm, but on a permanent/part-time basis, and noted that her hours varied so that if she was required to pick the children up earlier, she would work later and that she would work increased hours prior to school holiday periods so that she could spend school holiday time with the children. the mother confirmed that she earnt, approximately, $1,200.00 per fortnight after tax, being $31,200.00 per annum and her mortgage and associated (council and strata levies) expenses totalled $3,000.00 per month, being $36,000.00 per annum, without regard to her living expenses. (y) the mother lives in a one (1) bedroom unit that she owns, subject to a mortgage, situated at o street, suburb p, near location q. (z) the children attend r school. x is, currently, in year 4 and y is, currently, in year 3. (aa) the father had arranged for x to sit an opportunity class test on 28 july 2022. the father suggested that if x was offered an opportunity class placement, he would propose that x be enrolled in either s school, which he considered was his first preference or t school. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s application for an opportunity class placement but considered that, if x was offered such a placement, she would consider the same and that she may be agreeable to s school but would need further time to consider the same. the court accepts, given the uncertainty surrounding these matters that no orders should be made referrable to schooling issues, as referred to in paragraph 15, above. the court notes that the father, in his written submission, understood, given the order for equal shared parental responsibility, that no orders ought to be made about the school the children were to attend, now or into the future. that was an appropriate position to adopt and he is given credit, in that regard.   in 2006, the father and the mother married in china. (d) in 2013, x was born and he is, currently, 9 years of age. (e) in 2014, y was born and he is, currently, 8 years of age. (f) in october 2014, the father and the mother separated. (g) on 29 march 2016, the mother initiated property and parenting proceedings. (h) on 27 july 2016, final property and parenting orders were made, by consent, by judge monahan. (i) in august 2016, the father provided x’s passport to the mother, in accordance with her request, to enable her to take him to china. (j) in january 2017, the father provided x’s passport to the mother, in accordance with her request, to enable her to take him to china, although the mother said that this request referred to y. (k) in april 2017, the father and the mother divorced. (l) on 10 may 2019, the father requested y’s passport, which was then held by the mother, as he sought to take y to china to see his aunt who was seriously ill. the mother agreed that the father made that request but disputed that he had provided her with information about his aunt. (m) on 11 may 2019, the mother did not provide y’s passport to the father. (n) on 5 july 2019, the mother commenced these proceedings. (o) on 24 july 2019, the court ordered that the parties attend a child dispute conference with a family consultant nominated by the then child dispute section in the sydney registry of this court on 26 november 2019. a memorandum arising from that conference was, ultimately, prepared by ms d (“ms d”) on 28 november 2019.

(x) the mother completed a diploma and described her occupation as a carer at employer m in suburb n, working full-time hours, being 5 days per week between 9.00am and 5.00pm, but on a permanent/part-time basis, and noted that her hours varied so that if she was required to pick the children up earlier, she would work later and that she would work increased hours prior to school holiday periods so that she could spend school holiday time with the children. the mother confirmed that she earnt, approximately, $1,200.00 per fortnight after tax, being $31,200.00 per annum and her mortgage and associated (council and strata levies) expenses totalled $3,000.00 per month, being $36,000.00 per annum, without regard to her living expenses. (y) the mother lives in a one (1) bedroom unit that she owns, subject to a mortgage, situated at o street, suburb p, near location q. (z) the children attend r school. x is, currently, in year 4 and y is, currently, in year 3. (aa) the father had arranged for x to sit an opportunity class test on 28 july 2022. the father suggested that if x was offered an opportunity class placement, he would propose that x be enrolled in either s school, which he considered was his first preference or t school. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s application for an opportunity class placement but considered that, if x was offered such a placement, she would consider the same and that she may be agreeable to s school but would need further time to consider the same. the court accepts, given the uncertainty surrounding these matters that no orders should be made referrable to schooling issues, as referred to in paragraph 15, above. the court notes that the father, in his written submission, understood, given the order for equal shared parental responsibility, that no orders ought to be made about the school the children were to attend, now or into the future. that was an appropriate position to adopt and he is given credit, in that regard.   on 29 march 2016, the mother initiated property and parenting proceedings. (h) on 27 july 2016, final property and parenting orders were made, by consent, by judge monahan. (i) in august 2016, the father provided x’s passport to the mother, in accordance with her request, to enable her to take him to china.

(l) on 10 may 2019, the father requested y’s passport, which was then held by the mother, as he sought to take y to china to see his aunt who was seriously ill. the mother agreed that the father made that request but disputed that he had provided her with information about his aunt.

(s) between december 2019 and january 2020, the father travelled to china, where his father was undergoing a medical procedure and the children remained in the mother’s care. the father was also subjected to covid-19 travel restrictions while in china and upon his return to australia. the mother agreed that the children had remained with her but maintained that the father had provided her with no information about his circumstances in china. (t) on 17 february 2020, the children returned to live with the father. the father said that he had then learnt that the mother had taken y to see dr e who had diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“adhd”) and had prescribed him dexamphetamine. (u) on 1 december 2020, the family report of dr c dated 27 november 2020 was released to the parties, as referred to in paragraph 5, above. (v) the father has resided at f street, suburb g. within the last week (before the hearing), he moved to a temporary location at h street, suburb j as he proposed to relocate to a property at k street, suburb l (“the k street, suburb l property”) when its settlement was to be effected in late august/early september 2022. the mother called for a copy of the front page of the purchase contract which was provided by the father (see exhibit “court 4”) which confirmed that he was the sole purchaser of that property. the court accepts that the mother was unaware of the father’s location with the children at either suburb j or of his proposed relocation to the k street, suburb l property. (w) the father had graduated from a university in china and described his occupation as company manager but his employment appeared to be in the technology sector in partial charge of the technical aspects of technology. the father, initially, reported that he had moved away from the technology sector as it had long hours and did not fit with his childcare responsibilities. the father gave evidence that he was, now, hopeful of a promotion within his employment to become a retail manager, rather than being a manager of only part of the store. the father, initially, described his employment as flexible and it would appear that that flexibility enabled him to drop off the children at school at 9.00am and drive to his employment at around 10.00am and leave his employment at 2.30pm to collect the children from school. the father’s evidence was that, if he obtained a promotion, he would need to work more hours in the day which would be from 9.00am to 6.00pm, monday to friday. he also considered that this would be of assistance, given his acquisition of the k street, suburb l property for $2,480,000.00 (as confirmed in exhibit “court 4”). notwithstanding this, the court accepts from the father’s evidence that he also retains some continuing flexibility from his employment with, as he described it, a good relationship with the boss of the workplace. no evidence was called from the father’s employer. mr macdiarmid sought to challenge the father with respect to his evidence about his potential promotion and asserted that the same had only been raised to “better” the father’s position. the father denied that assertion. in that regard, the court is of the view that, even accepting the father’s evidence, it still remained unclear as to whether any change in his working hours would impact on his work flexibility into the future. (x) the mother completed a diploma and described her occupation as a carer at employer m in suburb n, working full-time hours, being 5 days per week between 9.00am and 5.00pm, but on a permanent/part-time basis, and noted that her hours varied so that if she was required to pick the children up earlier, she would work later and that she would work increased hours prior to school holiday periods so that she could spend school holiday time with the children. the mother confirmed that she earnt, approximately, $1,200.00 per fortnight after tax, being $31,200.00 per annum and her mortgage and associated (council and strata levies) expenses totalled $3,000.00 per month, being $36,000.00 per annum, without regard to her living expenses. (y) the mother lives in a one (1) bedroom unit that she owns, subject to a mortgage, situated at o street, suburb p, near location q. (z) the children attend r school. x is, currently, in year 4 and y is, currently, in year 3. (aa) the father had arranged for x to sit an opportunity class test on 28 july 2022. the father suggested that if x was offered an opportunity class placement, he would propose that x be enrolled in either s school, which he considered was his first preference or t school. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s application for an opportunity class placement but considered that, if x was offered such a placement, she would consider the same and that she may be agreeable to s school but would need further time to consider the same. the court accepts, given the uncertainty surrounding these matters that no orders should be made referrable to schooling issues, as referred to in paragraph 15, above. the court notes that the father, in his written submission, understood, given the order for equal shared parental responsibility, that no orders ought to be made about the school the children were to attend, now or into the future. that was an appropriate position to adopt and he is given credit, in that regard.   on 10 may 2019, the father requested y’s passport, which was then held by the mother, as he sought to take y to china to see his aunt who was seriously ill. the mother agreed that the father made that request but disputed that he had provided her with information about his aunt. (m) on 11 may 2019, the mother did not provide y’s passport to the father. (n) on 5 july 2019, the mother commenced these proceedings. (o) on 24 july 2019, the court ordered that the parties attend a child dispute conference with a family consultant nominated by the then child dispute section in the sydney registry of this court on 26 november 2019. a memorandum arising from that conference was, ultimately, prepared by ms d (“ms d”) on 28 november 2019.

(w) the father had graduated from a university in china and described his occupation as company manager but his employment appeared to be in the technology sector in partial charge of the technical aspects of technology. the father, initially, reported that he had moved away from the technology sector as it had long hours and did not fit with his childcare responsibilities. the father gave evidence that he was, now, hopeful of a promotion within his employment to become a retail manager, rather than being a manager of only part of the store. the father, initially, described his employment as flexible and it would appear that that flexibility enabled him to drop off the children at school at 9.00am and drive to his employment at around 10.00am and leave his employment at 2.30pm to collect the children from school. the father’s evidence was that, if he obtained a promotion, he would need to work more hours in the day which would be from 9.00am to 6.00pm, monday to friday. he also considered that this would be of assistance, given his acquisition of the k street, suburb l property for $2,480,000.00 (as confirmed in exhibit “court 4”). notwithstanding this, the court accepts from the father’s evidence that he also retains some continuing flexibility from his employment with, as he described it, a good relationship with the boss of the workplace. no evidence was called from the father’s employer. mr macdiarmid sought to challenge the father with respect to his evidence about his potential promotion and asserted that the same had only been raised to “better” the father’s position. the father denied that assertion. in that regard, the court is of the view that, even accepting the father’s evidence, it still remained unclear as to whether any change in his working hours would impact on his work flexibility into the future. (x) the mother completed a diploma and described her occupation as a carer at employer m in suburb n, working full-time hours, being 5 days per week between 9.00am and 5.00pm, but on a permanent/part-time basis, and noted that her hours varied so that if she was required to pick the children up earlier, she would work later and that she would work increased hours prior to school holiday periods so that she could spend school holiday time with the children. the mother confirmed that she earnt, approximately, $1,200.00 per fortnight after tax, being $31,200.00 per annum and her mortgage and associated (council and strata levies) expenses totalled $3,000.00 per month, being $36,000.00 per annum, without regard to her living expenses. (y) the mother lives in a one (1) bedroom unit that she owns, subject to a mortgage, situated at o street, suburb p, near location q. (z) the children attend r school. x is, currently, in year 4 and y is, currently, in year 3. (aa) the father had arranged for x to sit an opportunity class test on 28 july 2022. the father suggested that if x was offered an opportunity class placement, he would propose that x be enrolled in either s school, which he considered was his first preference or t school. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s application for an opportunity class placement but considered that, if x was offered such a placement, she would consider the same and that she may be agreeable to s school but would need further time to consider the same. the court accepts, given the uncertainty surrounding these matters that no orders should be made referrable to schooling issues, as referred to in paragraph 15, above. the court notes that the father, in his written submission, understood, given the order for equal shared parental responsibility, that no orders ought to be made about the school the children were to attend, now or into the future. that was an appropriate position to adopt and he is given credit, in that regard.   on 7 november 2019, the mother filed an amended initiating application. (r) in early 2020, the father said that he requested y’s birth certificate to open a bank account for y in accordance with a school requirement but the mother failed to provide it. the mother agreed that she did not provide the birth certificate but maintained that the purpose for the father’s request was not disclosed to her. (s) between december 2019 and january 2020, the father travelled to china, where his father was undergoing a medical procedure and the children remained in the mother’s care. the father was also subjected to covid-19 travel restrictions while in china and upon his return to australia. the mother agreed that the children had remained with her but maintained that the father had provided her with no information about his circumstances in china. (t) on 17 february 2020, the children returned to live with the father. the father said that he had then learnt that the mother had taken y to see dr e who had diagnosed him with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (“adhd”) and had prescribed him dexamphetamine.

(aa) the father had arranged for x to sit an opportunity class test on 28 july 2022. the father suggested that if x was offered an opportunity class placement, he would propose that x be enrolled in either s school, which he considered was his first preference or t school. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s application for an opportunity class placement but considered that, if x was offered such a placement, she would consider the same and that she may be agreeable to s school but would need further time to consider the same. the court accepts, given the uncertainty surrounding these matters that no orders should be made referrable to schooling issues, as referred to in paragraph 15, above. the court notes that the father, in his written submission, understood, given the order for equal shared parental responsibility, that no orders ought to be made about the school the children were to attend, now or into the future. that was an appropriate position to adopt and he is given credit, in that regard.   the father had graduated from a university in china and described his occupation as company manager but his employment appeared to be in the technology sector in partial charge of the technical aspects of technology. the father, initially, reported that he had moved away from the technology sector as it had long hours and did not fit with his childcare responsibilities. the father gave evidence that he was, now, hopeful of a promotion within his employment to become a retail manager, rather than being a manager of only part of the store. the father, initially, described his employment as flexible and it would appear that that flexibility enabled him to drop off the children at school at 9.00am and drive to his employment at around 10.00am and leave his employment at 2.30pm to collect the children from school. the father’s evidence was that, if he obtained a promotion, he would need to work more hours in the day which would be from 9.00am to 6.00pm, monday to friday. he also considered that this would be of assistance, given his acquisition of the k street, suburb l property for $2,480,000.00 (as confirmed in exhibit “court 4”). notwithstanding this, the court accepts from the father’s evidence that he also retains some continuing flexibility from his employment with, as he described it, a good relationship with the boss of the workplace. no evidence was called from the father’s employer. mr macdiarmid sought to challenge the father with respect to his evidence about his potential promotion and asserted that the same had only been raised to “better” the father’s position. the father denied that assertion. in that regard, the court is of the view that, even accepting the father’s evidence, it still remained unclear as to whether any change in his working hours would impact on his work flexibility into the future. (x) the mother completed a diploma and described her occupation as a carer at employer m in suburb n, working full-time hours, being 5 days per week between 9.00am and 5.00pm, but on a permanent/part-time basis, and noted that her hours varied so that if she was required to pick the children up earlier, she would work later and that she would work increased hours prior to school holiday periods so that she could spend school holiday time with the children. the mother confirmed that she earnt, approximately, $1,200.00 per fortnight after tax, being $31,200.00 per annum and her mortgage and associated (council and strata levies) expenses totalled $3,000.00 per month, being $36,000.00 per annum, without regard to her living expenses.

(b) the parents agreed that the children should, primarily, live with the father during the school week and were in agreement with respect to the school holiday arrangements. (c) both parents wished to change the arrangements by which the children spent weekends with the mother. (d) the mother reported that she did not wish to have any “face-to-face” contact with the father and was proposing that her time with the children start from after school on friday. (e) the father said that he would like to spend some time with the children on the weekends. (f) both parents spoke at length about the various disputes they have had in relation to the children being able to travel to china with each of them. both parents appeared to propose that the children could travel overseas with the other parent during their allocated time with that parent in the school holidays. the father said he would like the mother to provide a detailed itinerary before she travels. the mother stated that she would like to ensure that the father did not travel to city v at the same time as her and the children and that, if he did, he did not contact her or her family whilst there. (g) the police had been involved several times in relation to the parents’ disputes and that, in relation to an incident which had occurred at a handover at suburb r station in december 2019, following the police being called, an interim apprehended domestic violence order (“advo”) was taken out for the mother’s protection which the father maintained was dismissed in may 2020 and the mother maintained she was unaware as to whether any advo was in place or not. (h) further, in early february 2020, the father had contacted the police requesting a welfare check on the children as he was then in self-quarantine, having returned from city v and the children were living with the mother and, it would appear, had not been to school for the first 2 weeks of term. the police went to the mother’s home where they found the children in good health but noted that the mother, her parents and the children were all residing in a one (1) bedroom unit. the mother stated that, at the time, she was very unsure about what would happen with covid-19 and had, therefore, not sent the children to school. the children returned to school shortly after the police visit. the father confirmed, in his oral evidence, that while he had been in china he had not contacted the mother nor the children, other than by way of a contact to his solicitor. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s predicament in china, as referred to in paragraph 40(s), above. (i) the father and the mother appeared to have minimal direct contact with each other at handovers. the mother appeared to wait on one side of the ticket barrier at suburb r station (which the court notes has now been occurring at suburb g station) and the father on the other side and the children then walk over to the mother at her side. (j) there was no indication that either parent feared that the other would physically harm them but they both appeared to be very wary about the other making allegations against them or claiming that they were in some way abusing the children. they both appeared to be in fear of receiving, what they perceived as, threating letters from the other’s solicitors. (k) no current risks of family violence were identified. however, it was clear that there have been a number of issues at hand over and it was recommended that the parents’ “face-to-face” interactions be minimised. (l) she confirmed that the mother, who worked as a carer, had taken y to see dr e, paediatrician, after she became concerned about y’s over-activity and difficulty with focus and after having spoken to y’s kindergarten teacher about these concerns. the mother confirmed that y had received medication for, approximately, one (1) month and then came off it, although dr c noted that it was unusual for children under the age of 6 years to be put on stimulant medication as the general recommendation was that the first step was to try a behavioural approach to changing a child’s behaviour before medication was considered. (m) the children advised that they never spoke to the other parent when they were away from them. (n) she did not identify any current significant issues with regards to the children’s safety and wellbeing resulting from either of the parent’s care of them. however, the children may be at risk of being exposed to further altercations between the parents at “face-to-face” hand over. (o) no issues were identified in relation to either parent’s use of alcohol or any other substances or their mental health. (p) she identified that the key issue identified in relation to the parenting arrangements was a lack of any constructive communication between the parents. (q) the parents appeared to have some very basic communication by text or email but generally did not appear to communicate with each other about the children’s needs. despite then having been separated for 6 years, they continued to communicate with each other through their solicitors. the communication difficulties included the father asserting that the mother did not confer with him over getting y diagnosed with adhd and the mother asserted that the father did not consult with her when he enrolled the children in the r school. the mother, however, confirmed that she did not appear to have an objection to the children going to the suburb r school because she regarded it as a school with a good reputation. (r) both parents referred to the stress engendered on them as a result of the protracted dispute and negative impact of the ongoing legal dispute on their mental wellbeing. (s) both parents considered that the children were doing well at school. while both parents spoke of y as being an able little boy, they described him as being active but that he did not apply himself to his studies as well as x. the court notes the father’s evidence that, in terms of the opportunity class assessment, he considered that y may have a better chance than x of being offered an opportunity class placement. dr c’s enquiry with y’s class teacher indicated that he was under-achieving due to his challenge with focusing on tasks. the class teacher was aware of y being prescribed with some medication. (t) both parents described a range of “out of school” activities, including music lessons (for x), various sporting activities and ‘pre uni’ coaching college. both children also went to coaching college in suburb g for several hours each friday and had chinese classes (at which the father helped out). both children reported that they did not like going to coaching because they were there for 3 hours. (u) the mother reported taking the children swimming but now said that they would stay at home a bit more and play with a puppy. (v) the children presented as having a strong bond with each other. they reported rarely, if ever, seeing their parents talk or being together. the children said that their parents now had no contact with each other at handovers and they had not had the experience of both the mother and the father attending together at an event at school or at one of their extra-curricular activities. (w) neither of the children expressed any desire to change the way they spend time with the mother or with the father. (x) both children spoke positively about their relationships with the mother and with the father. (y) both children presented as having a warm and affectionate relationship with the mother and the father and moved between them without any evident distress or anxiety.   the parents agreed that the children should, primarily, live with the father during the school week and were in agreement with respect to the school holiday arrangements. (c) both parents wished to change the arrangements by which the children spent weekends with the mother. (d) the mother reported that she did not wish to have any “face-to-face” contact with the father and was proposing that her time with the children start from after school on friday. (e) the father said that he would like to spend some time with the children on the weekends. (f) both parents spoke at length about the various disputes they have had in relation to the children being able to travel to china with each of them. both parents appeared to propose that the children could travel overseas with the other parent during their allocated time with that parent in the school holidays. the father said he would like the mother to provide a detailed itinerary before she travels. the mother stated that she would like to ensure that the father did not travel to city v at the same time as her and the children and that, if he did, he did not contact her or her family whilst there. (g) the police had been involved several times in relation to the parents’ disputes and that, in relation to an incident which had occurred at a handover at suburb r station in december 2019, following the police being called, an interim apprehended domestic violence order (“advo”) was taken out for the mother’s protection which the father maintained was dismissed in may 2020 and the mother maintained she was unaware as to whether any advo was in place or not. (h) further, in early february 2020, the father had contacted the police requesting a welfare check on the children as he was then in self-quarantine, having returned from city v and the children were living with the mother and, it would appear, had not been to school for the first 2 weeks of term. the police went to the mother’s home where they found the children in good health but noted that the mother, her parents and the children were all residing in a one (1) bedroom unit. the mother stated that, at the time, she was very unsure about what would happen with covid-19 and had, therefore, not sent the children to school. the children returned to school shortly after the police visit. the father confirmed, in his oral evidence, that while he had been in china he had not contacted the mother nor the children, other than by way of a contact to his solicitor. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s predicament in china, as referred to in paragraph 40(s), above. (i) the father and the mother appeared to have minimal direct contact with each other at handovers. the mother appeared to wait on one side of the ticket barrier at suburb r station (which the court notes has now been occurring at suburb g station) and the father on the other side and the children then walk over to the mother at her side. (j) there was no indication that either parent feared that the other would physically harm them but they both appeared to be very wary about the other making allegations against them or claiming that they were in some way abusing the children. they both appeared to be in fear of receiving, what they perceived as, threating letters from the other’s solicitors. (k) no current risks of family violence were identified. however, it was clear that there have been a number of issues at hand over and it was recommended that the parents’ “face-to-face” interactions be minimised. (l) she confirmed that the mother, who worked as a carer, had taken y to see dr e, paediatrician, after she became concerned about y’s over-activity and difficulty with focus and after having spoken to y’s kindergarten teacher about these concerns. the mother confirmed that y had received medication for, approximately, one (1) month and then came off it, although dr c noted that it was unusual for children under the age of 6 years to be put on stimulant medication as the general recommendation was that the first step was to try a behavioural approach to changing a child’s behaviour before medication was considered. (m) the children advised that they never spoke to the other parent when they were away from them. (n) she did not identify any current significant issues with regards to the children’s safety and wellbeing resulting from either of the parent’s care of them. however, the children may be at risk of being exposed to further altercations between the parents at “face-to-face” hand over. (o) no issues were identified in relation to either parent’s use of alcohol or any other substances or their mental health. (p) she identified that the key issue identified in relation to the parenting arrangements was a lack of any constructive communication between the parents. (q) the parents appeared to have some very basic communication by text or email but generally did not appear to communicate with each other about the children’s needs. despite then having been separated for 6 years, they continued to communicate with each other through their solicitors. the communication difficulties included the father asserting that the mother did not confer with him over getting y diagnosed with adhd and the mother asserted that the father did not consult with her when he enrolled the children in the r school. the mother, however, confirmed that she did not appear to have an objection to the children going to the suburb r school because she regarded it as a school with a good reputation. (r) both parents referred to the stress engendered on them as a result of the protracted dispute and negative impact of the ongoing legal dispute on their mental wellbeing. (s) both parents considered that the children were doing well at school. while both parents spoke of y as being an able little boy, they described him as being active but that he did not apply himself to his studies as well as x. the court notes the father’s evidence that, in terms of the opportunity class assessment, he considered that y may have a better chance than x of being offered an opportunity class placement. dr c’s enquiry with y’s class teacher indicated that he was under-achieving due to his challenge with focusing on tasks. the class teacher was aware of y being prescribed with some medication. (t) both parents described a range of “out of school” activities, including music lessons (for x), various sporting activities and ‘pre uni’ coaching college. both children also went to coaching college in suburb g for several hours each friday and had chinese classes (at which the father helped out). both children reported that they did not like going to coaching because they were there for 3 hours. (u) the mother reported taking the children swimming but now said that they would stay at home a bit more and play with a puppy. (v) the children presented as having a strong bond with each other. they reported rarely, if ever, seeing their parents talk or being together. the children said that their parents now had no contact with each other at handovers and they had not had the experience of both the mother and the father attending together at an event at school or at one of their extra-curricular activities. (w) neither of the children expressed any desire to change the way they spend time with the mother or with the father. (x) both children spoke positively about their relationships with the mother and with the father. (y) both children presented as having a warm and affectionate relationship with the mother and the father and moved between them without any evident distress or anxiety.   both parents wished to change the arrangements by which the children spent weekends with the mother. (d) the mother reported that she did not wish to have any “face-to-face” contact with the father and was proposing that her time with the children start from after school on friday. (e) the father said that he would like to spend some time with the children on the weekends. (f) both parents spoke at length about the various disputes they have had in relation to the children being able to travel to china with each of them. both parents appeared to propose that the children could travel overseas with the other parent during their allocated time with that parent in the school holidays. the father said he would like the mother to provide a detailed itinerary before she travels. the mother stated that she would like to ensure that the father did not travel to city v at the same time as her and the children and that, if he did, he did not contact her or her family whilst there.

(l) she confirmed that the mother, who worked as a carer, had taken y to see dr e, paediatrician, after she became concerned about y’s over-activity and difficulty with focus and after having spoken to y’s kindergarten teacher about these concerns. the mother confirmed that y had received medication for, approximately, one (1) month and then came off it, although dr c noted that it was unusual for children under the age of 6 years to be put on stimulant medication as the general recommendation was that the first step was to try a behavioural approach to changing a child’s behaviour before medication was considered. (m) the children advised that they never spoke to the other parent when they were away from them. (n) she did not identify any current significant issues with regards to the children’s safety and wellbeing resulting from either of the parent’s care of them. however, the children may be at risk of being exposed to further altercations between the parents at “face-to-face” hand over. (o) no issues were identified in relation to either parent’s use of alcohol or any other substances or their mental health. (p) she identified that the key issue identified in relation to the parenting arrangements was a lack of any constructive communication between the parents. (q) the parents appeared to have some very basic communication by text or email but generally did not appear to communicate with each other about the children’s needs. despite then having been separated for 6 years, they continued to communicate with each other through their solicitors. the communication difficulties included the father asserting that the mother did not confer with him over getting y diagnosed with adhd and the mother asserted that the father did not consult with her when he enrolled the children in the r school. the mother, however, confirmed that she did not appear to have an objection to the children going to the suburb r school because she regarded it as a school with a good reputation. (r) both parents referred to the stress engendered on them as a result of the protracted dispute and negative impact of the ongoing legal dispute on their mental wellbeing. (s) both parents considered that the children were doing well at school. while both parents spoke of y as being an able little boy, they described him as being active but that he did not apply himself to his studies as well as x. the court notes the father’s evidence that, in terms of the opportunity class assessment, he considered that y may have a better chance than x of being offered an opportunity class placement. dr c’s enquiry with y’s class teacher indicated that he was under-achieving due to his challenge with focusing on tasks. the class teacher was aware of y being prescribed with some medication. (t) both parents described a range of “out of school” activities, including music lessons (for x), various sporting activities and ‘pre uni’ coaching college. both children also went to coaching college in suburb g for several hours each friday and had chinese classes (at which the father helped out). both children reported that they did not like going to coaching because they were there for 3 hours. (u) the mother reported taking the children swimming but now said that they would stay at home a bit more and play with a puppy. (v) the children presented as having a strong bond with each other. they reported rarely, if ever, seeing their parents talk or being together. the children said that their parents now had no contact with each other at handovers and they had not had the experience of both the mother and the father attending together at an event at school or at one of their extra-curricular activities. (w) neither of the children expressed any desire to change the way they spend time with the mother or with the father. (x) both children spoke positively about their relationships with the mother and with the father. (y) both children presented as having a warm and affectionate relationship with the mother and the father and moved between them without any evident distress or anxiety.   further, in early february 2020, the father had contacted the police requesting a welfare check on the children as he was then in self-quarantine, having returned from city v and the children were living with the mother and, it would appear, had not been to school for the first 2 weeks of term. the police went to the mother’s home where they found the children in good health but noted that the mother, her parents and the children were all residing in a one (1) bedroom unit. the mother stated that, at the time, she was very unsure about what would happen with covid-19 and had, therefore, not sent the children to school. the children returned to school shortly after the police visit. the father confirmed, in his oral evidence, that while he had been in china he had not contacted the mother nor the children, other than by way of a contact to his solicitor. the mother maintained that she was unaware of the father’s predicament in china, as referred to in paragraph 40(s), above. (i) the father and the mother appeared to have minimal direct contact with each other at handovers. the mother appeared to wait on one side of the ticket barrier at suburb r station (which the court notes has now been occurring at suburb g station) and the father on the other side and the children then walk over to the mother at her side.

(s) both parents considered that the children were doing well at school. while both parents spoke of y as being an able little boy, they described him as being active but that he did not apply himself to his studies as well as x. the court notes the father’s evidence that, in terms of the opportunity class assessment, he considered that y may have a better chance than x of being offered an opportunity class placement. dr c’s enquiry with y’s class teacher indicated that he was under-achieving due to his challenge with focusing on tasks. the class teacher was aware of y being prescribed with some medication. (t) both parents described a range of “out of school” activities, including music lessons (for x), various sporting activities and ‘pre uni’ coaching college. both children also went to coaching college in suburb g for several hours each friday and had chinese classes (at which the father helped out). both children reported that they did not like going to coaching because they were there for 3 hours.

primary considerations
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
in applying the considerations set out in the subsection (2), the court is to give greater weight to the consideration in paragraph 2(b). see s.60cc(2a) of the act.   approved the interpretation that a “meaningful relationship” is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child (citing mazorski v albright [2007] famca 520, per brown j and mccall v clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 per the full court), and (b) concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), and (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), and (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders (2007) famca 102 per kay j and chamness v hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.
abuse, in relation to a child, means: (a) an assault, including a sexual assault, of the child, or (b) a person (the first person) involving the child in a sexual activity with the first person or another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly, as a sexual object by the first person or the other person, and where there is unequal power in the relationship between the child and the first person, or (c) causing the child to suffer serious psychological harm, including (but not limited to) when that harm is caused by the child being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, or (d) serious neglect of the child. family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful.   an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or (d) repeated derogatory taunts, or (e) intentionally damaging or destroying property, or (f) intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, or (g) unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member’s family, of his or her liberty.   overhearing threats of death or personal injury by a member of the child’s family towards another member of the child’s family, or (b) seeing or hearing an assault of a member of the child’s family by another member of the child’s family, or (c) comforting or providing assistance to a member of the child’s family who has been assaulted by another member of the child’s family, or (d) cleaning up a site after a member of the child’s family has intentionally damaged property of another member of the child’s family, or (e) being present when police or ambulance officers attend an incident involving the assault of a member of the child’s family by another member of the child’s family.   the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(a) of the act is: (i) supportive of the position that as much time as possible with both parents is in the children’s best interests. the court accepts that the children have a meaningful relationship with both parents. the court does not accept that the orders proposed by the mother and the independent children’s lawyer would put the meaningful relationship existing between the children and both of their parents at risk. the proposal of the independent children’s lawyer and the mother sees a regular involvement with the father on 2 weekends each term, which has the potential for his meaningful relationship with the children to be maintained and developed. (b) the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(b) of the act is inapplicable on the facts of this case, given that the orders sought by the parties do not contemplate supervision and, otherwise, provide for reasonable time to be spent to the effect that the competing proposals do not suggest that the children are in need of protection from anything.   supportive of the position that as much time as possible with both parents is in the children’s best interests. the court accepts that the children have a meaningful relationship with both parents. the court does not accept that the orders proposed by the mother and the independent children’s lawyer would put the meaningful relationship existing between the children and both of their parents at risk. the proposal of the independent children’s lawyer and the mother sees a regular involvement with the father on 2 weekends each term, which has the potential for his meaningful relationship with the children to be maintained and developed.   the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(b) of the act is inapplicable on the facts of this case, given that the orders sought by the parties do not contemplate supervision and, otherwise, provide for reasonable time to be spent to the effect that the competing proposals do not suggest that the children are in need of protection from anything.
additional considerations any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child's views,
“there are many factors that may go to the weight that should be given to the wishes of the children and these will vary from case to case and it is undesirable and indeed impossible to catalogue or confine them in the manner suggested. ultimately it is a process of intuitive syntheses on the part of any trial judge weighing up all the evidence relevant to the wishes of the children and applying it in a common sense way as one of the factors in the overall assessment of the children’s best interests".  the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child's parents,   and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:  to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  ) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  i) to communicate with the child,   the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child, the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from: (i) either of his or her parents,   or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living, the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, the capacity of: (i) each of the child's parents, to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs  any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs, the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child's parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant. if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child: (i) the child's right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and (ii) the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right,  the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family,  if a family violence order applies, or has applied, (be it final, interim, contested or consented to) to the child or a member of the child’s family-any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:  the nature of the order, (ii) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  ) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  i) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  ) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,   any other relevant matter,  whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
reasonably practicability of ‘spending time’  how far apart the parents live from each other, and the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and  the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and such other matters as the court considers relevant
other parenting matters
those additional matters will then appear as subparagraphs 14.5 to 14.8 of order 14. the court accepts that those matters provide for information which is likely to lead to a greater degree of comfort in the non-travelling parent which has the potential to minimise any parental conflict, itself, in the best interests of the children.
