the approach to applications under s.90sm
... in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4). (emphasis in original)
the four step approach
the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application brought pursuant to the provisions of s.79. that approach involves four inter-related steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing. secondly, the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly, the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), (the other factors) including, because of s 79(4)(e), the matters referred to in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case ....   identify the assets owned by the parties, jointly or separately, and the liabilities to which the parties are subject, jointly or separately, (b) take into account the contributions made by each party, (c) take into account the so called “future factors”, and then (d) determine what order, if any is just and equitable.   take into account the contributions made by each party, (c) take into account the so called “future factors”, and then (d) determine what order, if any is just and equitable.   take into account the so called “future factors”, and then (d) determine what order, if any is just and equitable.   determine what order, if any is just and equitable.
the assets and liabilities
contributions
a. initial contributions
b. contributions during the relationship
c. contributions post separation
the s.90sm(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g) and the s.90sf(3) factors
whether it is just and equitable to alter the parties’ property interests
what order is just and equitable?  neither party contributed very much at the commencement of the relationship, (b) the parties’ contributions during the relationship were more or less equal, albeit of different types, (c) the wife has the care of the parties’ young child, (d) the husband is in arrears of child support and could be expected to not pay child support in the future, and (e) the husband has a greater earning potential than the wife, not least because the wife works part-time due to her child care responsibilities.   the parties’ contributions during the relationship were more or less equal, albeit of different types, (c) the wife has the care of the parties’ young child, (d) the husband is in arrears of child support and could be expected to not pay child support in the future, and (e) the husband has a greater earning potential than the wife, not least because the wife works part-time due to her child care responsibilities.   the wife has the care of the parties’ young child, (d) the husband is in arrears of child support and could be expected to not pay child support in the future, and (e) the husband has a greater earning potential than the wife, not least because the wife works part-time due to her child care responsibilities.   the husband is in arrears of child support and could be expected to not pay child support in the future, and (e) the husband has a greater earning potential than the wife, not least because the wife works part-time due to her child care responsibilities.   the husband has a greater earning potential than the wife, not least because the wife works part-time due to her child care responsibilities.
