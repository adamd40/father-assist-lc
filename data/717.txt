contempt applications
criminal contempts are acts or omissions that have a tendency to interfere with or undermine the authority, performance or dignity of the courts of justice or those who participate in their proceedings. although criminal contempts take many forms, their characteristic attribute is an interference with the due administration of justice either in a particular case or as part of a continuing process. defiance of the court or its procedures, publication of matters scandalising the court, actions calculated to prejudice the fair trial of a pending case, threats to parties or witnesses and misconduct within the court are examples of criminal contempts.[6]
application filed 20 december 2018
during the proceedings in the federal circuit court of australia - family law division case file mlc4941/2014 and the application in a case for departure from child support assessment (filed 11 november 2014), the respondent father had: repeatedly, knowingly and deliberately made false statements on his sworn affidavits, court submissions and financial statements to mislead this court. repeatedly, knowingly and deliberately suppressed and/or omitted critical and relevant evidence and facts on his sworn affidavits, court submissions, financial statements and undertakings to disclose to mislead this court. repeatedly, knowingly and deliberately suppressed and/or omitted critical and relevant evidence and facts on his sworn affidavits, court submissions and financial statements to mislead this court. repeatedly, knowingly and deliberately contravened his obligations for full and frank disclosure on financial statements, on sworn affidavits and submissions and to this court in breach of rule 13.01, 13.02, 13.03. 13.04 and 13.14 (a)(ii) of the family law rules 2004.
her honour, despite concluding that [mr cousins] had not contributed and maintained our children appropriately, had then made an erroneous discretionary judgement [sic] to dismiss the application for departure from child support assessment and cost orders, due to [mr cousins]’s alleged deliberate omission/suppression of his true and accurate income and salary and that of his wife, [mrs cousins].[8]
“[i]t is difficult to envisage a case where failure to comply with orders for disclosure could be said to involve a flagrant challenge to the authority of the court or where an established failure to fully disclose could be other than a contravention covered by part xiiia of the act and not part xiiib.”[10]
so much is consistent with a conclusion that the availability of other remedies for ms peake’s complaints renders them incapable of sustaining a finding of contempt.
application filed 3 july 2019
application filed 1 july 2022
despite my multiple emails, [mr cousins] refused to comply with orders of this honourable court. he did not comply for court orders of 19 january 2022, 25 february 2022 and 23 may 2022.[17]
on or around 10 june 2022, [[mr cousins]] (by way of victoria police) filed his further and better particulars in the magistrate courts for his application to vary the final fivo filed on 11 february 2022, with publication and dissemination of confidential family law documents including but not limited to, mentions of justices’ names, privileged lawyers’ correspondence, listing of family law proceedings and family reports, in alleged breach of s121 of the family law act 1975.[19] [[mr cousins’]] statements provided to victoria police on 10 february 2022 and for my arrest on 11 november 2021, also contained lies, false statements, swearing and alleged breach of s121 of the family law act 1975.[20]
