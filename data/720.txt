chronology of events:
the parents’ relationship:
the assault of 16 january 2013:
i said: “i am gunna give you five seconds cunt before i clout ya.” [mr snyder] then let go of [ms argyle’s] neck. i said: “what the fuck is going on?” [mr snyder] said: “she won’t give me my car keys.” by this stage, i observed other neighbours had exited their properties to see what was going on. i did not observe [mr snyder] to have any obvious injuries. i then said to [ms argyle] words to the effect of: “where’s his keys? give the silly cunt his keys back so he can fuck off.” [ms argyle] then threw [mr snyder’s] keys to him and he left. shortly thereafter, [ms argyle’s] parents and brother arrived. i recall letting them know what had happened and then going back home, as i considered [ms argyle] was safe with them.

the law:
best interests: ] ...to analyse carefully the evidence led on behalf of the mother in relation to the impact that allowing the child supervised time with the father would have on her caregiving capacity. for present purposes however it may be accepted that there would need to be very cogent evidence that, to use the language of the full court in marra & marra, the mother’s caregiving capacity would be discernibly impaired by any order that the child have time with the father (see re andrew, at 83,201) for such an order not to be made. ultimately, as the full court has consistently observed, the lodestar is the welfare and best interests of the child, which principle now finds statutory expression in s 60ca of the act: re andrew, 83,199. [1] the primary judge’s reference to the need for “very cogent evidence” should be read as meaning no more than the fact that a parent asserting that a child should spend no time with the child’s other parent should be in a position to prove, by adducing evidence of sufficient weight, the basis of their contention to the reasonable satisfaction of the court. in that context, for a tribunal of fact to be satisfied, on the balance of probabilities, of the existence of a fact, it must feel an actual persuasion of the existence of that fact: see briginshaw v briginshaw [1938] hca 34, (1938) 60 clr 336 (per dixon j), helton v allen [1940] hca 20, (1940) 63 clr 691 at 712 (per mctiernan j), nguyen v cosmopolitan homes [2008] nswca 246 at [44] (per mcdougall j).
subsequent authorities, however, confirm that it is an error to assume that, in each and every case where a parent is concerned about the safety of a child in the other parent’s care, the court will infer that there is an unacceptable risk that the concerned parent’s parenting capacity will be adversely impacted. to do so risks elevating those fears to an extent that it overshadows the totality of considerations set out in section 60cc of the act. in particular, as noted by the primary judge, it does not give the concerned parent a right of “veto” over whether the child should have time with the other parent. (my emphasis)
if the court does not find that a parent represents an unacceptable risk of harm, it may nonetheless take into account anxiety on the part of the other parent arising from a genuine, but not necessarily rational, belief that a parent represents such a risk of harm. in such a case, the other parent’s belief must be genuinely held. if it is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the belief would clearly be open to doubt. however, where such a belief is genuinely held, if the child spending time with a parent would sufficiently erode the other parent’s capacity to properly care for the child, then that may of itself mean that the ensuing detriment to the child determines that it is in their best interests not to spend time with or communicate with the parent. further, where the history of abuse, violence or like behaviour between two parents means that any continued interaction between them would similarly erode the resident parent’s capacity to care for the child, the need for peace and tranquillity in their household may be a more compelling need for the child and hence might also justify an order prohibiting the other parent from spending time or communicating with the child.
