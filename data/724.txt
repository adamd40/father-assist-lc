reasons for judgment
judge obradovic:
legal principles
it is now well established principle that whilst some special requirements may apply, relocation cases are guided and judicial officers are bound by the same legislative pathways as other parenting cases under the act. in other words relocation is not to be treated as a discrete issue in the making of parenting orders ... a requirement in relocation cases is that judges faced with a parent wanting to relocate must consider the competing proposals of both parents ... it is not simply a matter of comparing the relocating party’s proposal against the status quo and allowing or denying relocation. rather the court must consider each party’s proposal on its merits, in accordance with the prescribed legislative pathway. (references omitted)
20. ...it is well established that the proposed relocation of children to a geographically distant place should be considered as just one of the proposals for the children’s future living arrangements, rather than as a discrete issue (taylor and barker [2007] famca 1236, (2007) flc 93-345 at 81,912). 21. the mother’s desire to relocate overseas with the children was but one factor which would influence the primary judge’s determination about proper parenting orders for the children. while the mother did not lose her right to enjoy a high measure of freedom of movement merely because of her parental responsibility for the children (ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 at 196, 206–208 and 210), her desire to relocate potentially conflicted with the children’s interest to know and have regular contact with the father. the mother’s position at trial was that she would not leave australia without the children (at [197]), so her right to the freedom of mobility had to yield if their interests, being the paramount consideration, would be harmed by the international relocation (u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 at 262). it is well recognised that, other than in instances of abusive relationships, children benefit from the development of good relationships with both parents (u v u at 285–286, m v m (1988) 166 clr 69 at 76 and 78). 22. section 60cc of the act prescribes the mandatory considerations which must be factored into the overall decision as to how the children’s best interests will be served. more specifically for present purposes, s 60cc(3)(j) of the act required the primary judge to consider the occurrence of any family violence involving the children or any family member as a pertinent factor in formulating the orders which would promote the children’s best interests.
