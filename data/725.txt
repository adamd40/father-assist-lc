26.1 following an assessment on 10 december 2010 the child was diagnosed as having an overall global developmental delay falling within the mild rage, with particular difficulties in language and social communication. it was noted that the child presented at the observation with features keeping with an autism spectrum disorder (language delay, poor eye contact, and tendency to play on his own). it was recommended that the child’s preschool apply for additional funding to increase the child’s support, that the child increase his preschool days, and a follow up observation occur in the following months. it was also recommended that the child continue speech pathology and attend occupational therapy, and have a follow up with [dr f] and a [dr l]. 26.2 following an assessment on 25 august 2011 the child was diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. this was based on his level of eye contact, facial expression and gesture to regulate social interaction and compensate for his language delays. it was recommended that the parties access fahcsia funding, speech therapy and other early intervention services. the parties were recommended to apply for a carer’s allowance, continue the inclusion of the child’s preschool and to continue consulting with [dr f]. 26.3 the child was again seen on 22 october 2012, 15 november 2012 and 29 november 2012. it was noted that results from testing and observations suggested his intellectual abilities were not within the disability range but that he would still struggle with his same aged peers. the dsu opined that the child’s past social engagement and behaviour might have been influenced by his parents’ separation. it was noted that his current skills suggest strengths in areas that are unexpected for children with autism. it was recommended that the child would be old enough to go to school the following year but that it would be better for him to start in 2014. speech and language assessment for the child was recommended prior to the child starting school. the dsu also recommended the child commence school in a mainstream class and that there be consistency of routines and discipline strategies across home environments. 26.4 a fourth assessment was undertaken over august and october 2013. the child was diagnosed with a speech and language disorder. this assessment showed low average nonverbal thinking skills and extremely low verbal thinking skills. the dhs recommended that the child obtain an eye review (due to recent continued rubbing of his eyes), ongoing consultation with [dr f], continued speech and occupational therapy, and ongoing psychological help to assist the child adapt to changes in his family life and develop resilience and confidence at school.
since the 2015 orders  klaric] approached me this morning regarding the court order explaining that with the new term the weekly cycle for pickup and delivery to school resets back to cycle 1 for week 1. so term 4 week 2 will be cycle 2. however, [ms varga] believes week 2 to be cycle 3 and insists that she will pick him up every thursday and [mr klaric] is wrong conference call with [ms n] and [ms varga] did not clear up matters. contacted legal branch and was advised that since both parents share custody either parent can collect him and the court order must be worked out by them. if there is a confrontation between both parties at school, we should ask them both to leave for 5 minutes and only one return when they have done so. if neither or both return, explain the school will contact facs or the police.   klaric] and [ms varga] are still in disagreement as to when the 4 week custody cycle begins as stated in the court order. both parents are unable to work this out. consequently, [x] was not picked up form school...

thank you for your letter regarding [x], a now 12 year 8 month old boy who i haven’t seen since 2015. i saw him today with both of his parents and both separately, but not [x] separately. the consultation was assisted by a psychometric assessment looking at his educational ability and iq score done in may this year by [ms g], educational psychologist. his cognitive assessment would suggest that he will struggle and require a lot of support in any educational environment. overall, his iq is in the borderline range and his learning is in the borderline range, and explaining to his parents today how important it is to maintain a good level of support at school both at school and at home to keep him out of the disability range is very important... again, given his iq and his educational ability a lot of work will need to be put in in all environments to assist him with his progress. current concerns medically are his weight, particularly truncal obesity and stretch marks and the possibility of associated insulin resistance ... he is good at sport ad enjoys [sports] once or twice a week, but he doesn’t do a lot by way of incidental exercise. his father is focussed on keeping him happy and resilient but his mother would like him to be further supported educationally and in a sporting sense. ... in association with his truncal obesity, there is borderline hypertension at a bmi of 28. his blood pressure today was 132/96. his weight 95.7 kg, his height 185 cm ... ... i have sent him off for standard bloods... i will see him again in 6 months to see how things are going in terms of his weight, his bmi and his pubertal status, and the recommendations that have been made for dietetic review, podiatrist review, and additional learning support at school should be adhered to.
there is a suggestion after speaking with [x] only moments ago that you shall not drop him off at [mr j’s] [[mr j]] office tomorrow morning so that i may spend time and see [x] for his birthday. i have organised such a beautiful day for him! please ensure that you do. i am so over this, you constantly cause unnecessary stress, anxiety, worry and disappointment for me and my family time and time again. not to mention what this erratic behaviour does to [x]. all this is extraordinary to say the least. i am looking forward to seeing my darling [x] for his birthday.   had a follow up appointment with [dr f] this wednesday 17 march and i have just been informed this morning by [w] paediatrics that you cancelled the appointment without communicating with me prior to doing so. please remember [x] has a mother and that is me, i am not dead [mr klaric] and i have a say with what happens with [x] especially when it comes to his learning, development, health and wellbeing. i am so disappointed with your actions, this was an important follow up with [dr f] which we cannot get back. please may i also ask you not to bad mouth [dr f] to [x] instead you should be taking on board [dr f]’s recommendations ie not allowing [x] extensive time to sit on the playstation instead encourage more exercise activities and reviewing his diet. both of which remain unchanged. further discussions about these issues needed to be had with [dr f] on wednesday as you cannot continue to compromise [x]'s health and future. appointments with [dr f] are hard to obtain and as a result we cannot see her again until wednesday 21 july at 2.30pm. under no circumstances are you to cancel this appointment.   has been invited to a very special birthday after school on wednesday afternoon. he has expressed a desire to go and to not miss out on this? it is scheduled at 4.30pm to 7.30pm. it is a [sports activity themed] birthday party which includes 16 boys from his school and he really wants to go. i have spoken to the father of the birthday boy and he has paid for [x] to participate in the event and all the boys are so excited. so you can imagine how excited [x] is as well? can you please support our son to participate and we can re-schedule the [dr f] appointment?
...we had a follow up appointment with [dr f] on the 17 march which you cancelled on the morning of the appointment, without my knowledge and without re-scheduling it. i made another appointment on the day you cancelled, new appointment shall be on 21 july at 2.30pm. this is an important follow up with [dr f]. please do not cancel this appointment, it is in [x]'s best interest to go. this appointment holds priority over other events such as birthday parties, which is the reason you cancelled the last appointment...
... ... [x] easily worked up and frustrated - most of this directed towards his mother. unable to give specific details as to what exactly had happened. physically easily agitated. loud voice, waving arms. happy at school. mildly worried about covid-19, misses friends. happy that he is going to local school with friends - "imagine if i had to go to mum's school,... that would have been terrible". [x] and i mainly focussed on some strategies to reduce frustration and also multiple perspective taking. when given the option not to see his mother, [x] says "no that wouldn't be fair because she is my mum". [x] found it hard to see things from different point of views - became defensive, and interpreted that i was not believing his narrative. determined that his mother just 'cared about herself' and dad 'does everything'. despite this later in the session, able to talk positively about time and activities spent with mum. ... (as per the original)
... [x] reported that he had an incident with his mother during the school holidays that resulted in the police being called. he has decided that at present he does not want any contact with his mother. discussed [x]'s current sense of well being and who he can talk to etc when he is anxious. [x] states that generally he is coping well with online learning and has maintained contact with his friends.
... 55 whilst at the park, i received a call from [constable z] at 11.18am. constable [z] appeared confused as to why the father called him, i to was confused as to what was going on. i started to worry and thought that something had happened at my home as the constable thought we were there and mentioned something about [x] talking to someone on the phone. i responded with words to the effect, "oh yes x was speaking to his grandfather when we were at home but we are at the park now". the constable then proceeded to say we have received a call from your ex­ husband. i asked why? about what? he asked is everything ok? i responded words to the effect, "everything is absolutely fine. i don't understand what is going on". whilst speaking to the officer [x] approached me and started to overhear the conversation. the officer then proceeded to ask if we at some stage could come to [suburb m] police station just to make sure you're ok. i said yes of course. when i got off the phone [x] started to look worried and scared. he asked me "who i was on the phone with?" i replied, "the police". [x] then asked, "mum am i going to get into trouble?" i said " [x] no not at all, you have done nothing wrong". i was not sure as to what was going on and why the father called the police. after leaving the park i proceeded to go to seven eleven petrol station to get petrol it was upon returning to the car that i noticed that [x] was on his phone. [x] told me that his father called him and asked him to put his phone on locator. i then asked him why? [x] replied, "dad is coming here". i had no idea as to why the father was coming and why he was trying to interfere in my time. i called the number which the police officer earlier on called me from. i wasn't sure if it was the same constable as i spoke to previously but i proceeded to explain what was going on and that the father is trying to collect my son and i don't know why. the officer said words to the effect, "turn off the locator immediately and we can either send for police there or leave". i told the officer that i would go home which i did. when driving home [x] asked me again if he was going to get into trouble. i assured x you haven't done anything wrong. why is dad trying to pick me up? i have no idea. close to home i decided to stop at the petrol station to grab some bread, i asked x to come with him, i then noticed [x] started walking the other direction i said to [x] where are you going? he didn't answer i then walked his way. he entered a pizza shop and started getting really worried. [x] asked the lady if she could call the father. the father told this lady that he was coming there. i quickly then ran to the car to grab my phone and called [suburb m] police station to have the police come. the father arrived before the police and i asked "what is going on? why did you call the police this morning?" he said because i heard you say on the phone "i am going to kill you". i was shocked by this allegation and said to the father, words to the effect, "what are you talking about? i did not say that. that is not true. neither of us spoke to you [mr klaric] ". i was unsure as to why [mr klaric] would say this when we did not speak over the phone, i have not spoken to [mr klaric] over the phone for years. then i heard [x] repeat what [mr klaric] had said about me. i asked [x] "why did you repeat this [x] ?" [x] responded "dad said you did”.   per the original)
...approximately 2 hours later, [x] telephoned me and said words to the effect of “mum said she is going to hang onto me until next wednesday”. i could hear the respondent saying “i’m going to kill you” to [x] because he called me. i then rang [suburb m] police station and reported the situation. the police told me they would go to the house and then rang me back to say they could not find the respondent or [x]. a woman then rang me on a landline after about another hour from a pizza shop in [suburb m] and said “your son has run away from his mother and has asked me to call you” and put [x] on the phone. i said, “stay there, don’t move, i’m coming to get you”. i could then hear the respondent who had parked up the road from the pizza shop yelling at [x] “come here, what are you doing?” [x] said “leave me alone”. the woman from the pizza shop then came back on the phone to me and said “i’m ringing the police”. i drove straight from my workplace to [suburb m]. the police then attended the pizza shop with 2 paddy wagons and arrived about 10 minutes after i arrived. the respondent was still yelling. three female police officers took the respondent away from the scene while the male police officers spoke with me and [x] separately and then told me to take [x] home after he had expressed a wish to police to go home with me. (as per the original)
...about 11:00am on friday the 9th of july 2021, the father contacted police regarding the victim contacting him and wanting to talk and hearing the mother yelling in the background. the victim kept telling the father to pick him up as he didn't want to spend any more time with his mother as she lied to him. the mother picked up the victim and informed him that instead of dropping him off on the weekend, she was in fact keeping the victim until wednesday. police believe the victim and the mother potentially suffer some form of mental health and are unable to communicate at a usual level. the mother was out with the victim and the victim continued to update the father where they were so that the father could come and get him as he didn't want to remain with the mother. eventually the father caught up with the two at i love pizza on [suburb m] road where a verbal argument between the two erupted inside of the store. according to staff at the pizza shot , the mother was quite loud and yelling about it is her weekend to spend with the victim, however, the victim wanted nothing to do with her and wanted to go home with the father. police spoke to all parties and told the victim that if he wishes to go home with his father that he could and there would be no issues. the victim left the location with his father and police informed the mother that due to what the victim wanted, he was allowed to go with the father. the mother continued to argue with police and began making tit for tat allegations about the father and his alledged aggression. the mother was explained that if she wishes to see the victim that she will need to continue with the current family law court proceedings of which police cannot enforce. however, police did inform the mother that police were in fact stating that this weekend, the victim is to stay with the father due to de escalating the situation that has occurred this weekend about custody. the mother continued to make allegations and contacted several police stations as police informed her that no advo was being applied for on her behalf due to the situation not requiring one. several police stations including 14 have informed her that no advo will be applied for in this situation. the mother then began to make allegations of historical domestic incidents which 14 informed her that if she wishes to report them they would have to be reported as a separate incident, and due to the circumstances, the current incident would be taken into account for credibility...

[x] is feeling positive about the arrangement...
thank you for your letter regarding [x], a now 14 year 2 month old boy who i haven't seen since september 2020. for various reasons the planned follow up appointment after that consultation was not attended. general well-being bloods and chromosomal studies were though promptly attended to as requested after the appointment in 2020. you do have the results in his file. pleasingly his detailed genetic studies returned normal results. of note though were abnormal lipid studies with a raised cholesterol, tg and ldl. bloods were done because [x]'s bmi was in a well above a healthy weight range (28). there was no increase in insulin on fasting bloods. his bmi today has edged up to 28.5. it is time to get a dietician and/or a personal trainer involved in meal planning, dietary advice, regular weight measurements and an exercise program to address his weight and abnormal lipid profile. because of the complex parent dynamics. [x]'s eating and weight needs to be monitored externally and regularly until his bmi comes into the normal range. i will make some recommendations about health professionals who might take on this role and provide a referral. i saw [x] on his own, his father and mother on their own but separately, and all three together. i am trying to maintain some objectivity around caring for [x]. i have known him since preschool when he was diagnosed with a pervasive developmental disorder. he has an iq in the borderline (slow-learner) range without additional specific learning disabilities. he is in year 8 at d school. i have spoken to [mr ac] to gain further information regarding [x]'s academic progress, the support he receives and the provisions he has for exams. [mr ac] forwarded [x]'s term 1 progress report for my file. he is in a class with targeted learning support by a special needs teacher with remedial tuition across all subjects for 20 periods a fortnight with occasional slso support in addition. he receives the provisions of small group supervision and extra time (5 minutes every 30 minutes) for exams. attendance for this term is 83%. [x] is reported to be well behaved with rare minor misdemeanours. he requires support to stay on task to complete work. he is reported to tend to rush through work in science. he is distractable. by definition children with borderline intellectual ability require repetition and support to learn. his mother would prefer that he is educated in a more focused and supportive environment than where he is currently. speaking to [x] on his own today he is happy at his current school and would prefer not to change schools. his mother emphasised today that she believed [x]'s best outcome would come through improving his educational support. [x]'s father acknowledges that his strengths are in practical subjects such as tech and woodwork and this is where he will settle in the longer term. there is a lot to take into account when considering moving schools at this stage of [x]'s education. he is reported to have quite a few friends at his current school. [mr ac] did confirm that there had been some social issues with perceived bullying which had been addressed by the school deputy principal and may have been related to [x] misreading social cues. [x] would like to be involved in team sport. he has played [sports] in the past but is considering [sports]. he would be at an advantage in his age group given his size. team sport would mean regular training and games which would be good for [x]'s physical fitness and weight control, not to mention sleep although this is reasonable at present. team sport also means that he would have to commit to the sport with regular attendance so not to let his team down. [x] has a large appetite. take away food is an exception rather than the rule. he is exposed to cigarette smoke at his father's house. on examination today [x] was generally well. his weight 111.9kg and his height 198cm. bp was down compared to previously at 113/69, heart rate 79/min and regular. pubertal staging was tanner 4. prosody was direct and volume loud. his mother was concerned that he had been coached in what he should say to me but i did independently corroborate what he told me with what his father told me separately, thus i would consider that there was validity to what i was told about what food was eaten at home, how often takeaway was eaten etc. [x] will need his fasting bloods rechecked six months after he commences his dietary/exercise program. i am happy to arrange this. i will see him again as necessary.

...wanted to share historic information re mother. reported instances of mum: hitting him in the head when he was younger not collecting him from school when he was younger calling the police on dad when he and dad were enjoying a holiday at queensland theme parks sc acknowledged that this must have been difficult for l and his father. l reported having more control now and a great relationship with dad. l reported that he has moved 12 x since he was a child and that mum would like him to attend [v school]. l reported having a children’s lawyer and has supervised visits with his mother. general reports of mental health concerns in relation to his mother... (as per the original)   was distressed at school today following a delivery of donuts from his mother [ms varga]. [x] was called to the office to accept the delivery. he opened the card that read “happy halloween my beautiful boy!!!! love you so much xxxxx” and he immediately scrunched the card in a ball and threw it in the bin. [x] proceeded to tell office staff he did not want the donuts. the office staff alerted me to [x]'s upset and i asked him to come and have a chat to make sure he was okay. [x] then stated he wanted nothing to do with his mother. the reason he gave for this was that the last time he saw her (september) she was engaged in a road rage incident in her car. he said that he asked her to stop and she turned her anger on him and slapped him across the face twice. he said he got out of the car in the middle of the city and called his dad on his mobile phone to collect him. he talked about his mother trying to take him away from his father and wanting him to change schools which he did not want to do. he repeatedly states he wants nothing to do with his mother. an e-report regarding this incident has been made to the dcj (ref no: ...). (as per the original)
expert evidence
i asked [ms varga] to reflect on the ongoing conflict with the father and why she thought they had not been able to resolve conflict. she said she thinks it is because the father interferes with her time with [x] unnecessarily. she said the father involves [x] unnecessarily and give [x] anxiety and stress. she described the father as being the cause of unnecessary conflict. ... i asked the mother how she felt she had contributed to eth conflict with the father [a propos of the incident on 6 june 2021]. she said “i don’t think i’ve done anything to contribute to the conflict”. she said she is not sure why the father is doing this but the conflict needs to stop.”
given the length of the history of the dispute, i asked [mr klaric] why he thought that he and the mother were still in conflict with one another. he said “i have tried and tried to resolve it. i’m at the point where i don’t know what path to take anymore. he said in the past he had worked very hard to “take the high road” and had “stayed silent so many times”. he said that initially he thought he should just do whatever [ms varga] demanded, but that even when he tried this approach, she continued to be critical and derogatory. he said that the mother would “blackmail” him and say things such as “you won't see your son”, “i will ruin you” and “i will make sure your friends hate you”. he said he still does not understand what he has done for the mother to be so revengeful towards him. ... i asked [mr klaric] to reflect on his own behaviour in the conflict with the mother. he said “i have had some monumental arguments with her”. he said that in general they had “terrible arguments”. he was said there were times when he “couldn’t get a word in” and he was “cut off and abused”. i asked the father specifically about some of the language and behaviour he had engaged in. he agreed that the language in text messages he had sent the mother was “horrendous”. he agreed that he used inappropriate language. he agreed that he had called the mother “psycho” and described her as having mental problems and used other offensive terms to describe her. he said that when they have arguments, “they get personal” and he can “get the point where i can't take any more of it”. over the last two years, [mr klaric] told me that the mother has “just stopped communication” and consistently tells him that he is “blocked”. he said that even if he has engaged in neutral or positive communication, such as saying thank you to the mother, “she just wants to fight and argue”.
with respect to [x]’s psychological health, [ms varga] noted that he is very anxious because “his father constantly involves him in problems.”  e father] acknowledged that [x] had been adversely affected by conflict. he sometimes wonders whether [x]'s cognitive delays had been caused by the parental conflict or at least made worse by it. ... overall, [mr klaric] said that he thinks that [x] has been “pummelled by the family law system”. he said that “it has never been about [x] not seeing his mother”. he said that his strongest first instinct is “to protect our child.” he said [x] “comes straight to me for comfort”. he said, “i’m pretty sure he loves her a lot and wants to have a relationship with her”. he said that despite everything that happened between them that “ [x] has still been keen to go back and see his mum. he still loves her and wants to have a mother”. however, he said that [x] has been worn out by the conflict. he described himself as fatigued and said “i don’t know what we are still fighting for”.   varga] arrived later in the day, and i was able to observe her with [x]. although there was a great deal of initial awkwardness, [x] politely greeted his mother. [ms varga] was positive with [x]. she affectionately greeted him and hugged and kissed him. although [x] was not terribly enthusiastic, he accepted his mother’s affection. at several points, [ms varga] affectionately stroked [x]'s hair and he tried to brush this off and appeared mildly irritated. ... i asked [x] what his mother could do to improve their relationship. he said “for me to be able to call dad” when he was with his mother. i asked [ms varga] what [x] could do to improve their relationship and she said, “that when i am with you that your dad respects the time we have and doesn’t interfere in that time”. i observed that [x] had become very upset at this comment and was looking away quite tearfully.
throughout the observation, [mr klaric] was patient, attentive and kind towards [x]. i noted that he allowed [x] to speak to me independently, and from time to time encouraged [x]'s prosocial skills. for example, at one point after i had asked a question [x] was looking towards his father and [mr klaric] encouraged [x] to respond directly to me, which he did. at another point, [mr klaric] corrected [x] as he had used a swear word, and [x] complied with his father's direction. [mr klaric] was verbally affectionate towards [x], referring to him as “mate”.   and his father told me about his paternal grandmother who lives with them. [x] refers to her as “bubba”. he said that she speaks a mixture of english and [language ah]. he said that his grandmother is “very protective” of him, which can be “annoying” at times. he gave the example of his grandmother hovering over him in the kitchen without understanding he can do things independently and will not hurt himself. [x] thought that his father was “not too strict”. there was general discussion about the rules at home. [mr klaric] told me that [x] is a very tidy sort of person who takes great care in ensuring his room is impeccable. [x] agreed and said that he liked his things a particular way. [x] spoke openly and positively about his mother. he also spoke very positively about his uncle [mr j] [[mr j]], explaining that his uncle had been able to take him to [sports games]. he also pointed out that his uncle lives nearby [to my offices in the city].   he said he wants his mother to try to understand that he wants to be able to see her when he wants. he said that there had been so many problems over the years. he said that he does not understand “why we can’t communicate”. he said that things can go well for a period and then “something always goes wrong” between them and “there are always fights”. ... [x] spoke about feeling caught in a never-ending conflict with his parents. he said, “mum thinks that dad tells me lies about her and that dad is brainwashing me”. he said, “i argue back and i say, ‘it’s not true’”. he said he normally keeps quiet about things he has done with his father. he said that he thought that his father does not speak to his mother. [x] said that his relationship with his mother “frustrates me”. he said, “she can be a really good mum” and acknowledged that there had been things he had done with his mother which had been fun. he said, “i want her to support me” and “not be rude with me”. he said that his mother did not support him playing [sports] near his home and with his friends. he said he wanted to play [sports] with his “mates”. [x] was able to describe some positive experiences with his mother. he said that they used to go to some sporting events together and they supported [af team] last year. he said that he also had fun with his mother at the pool and [sports] and that he loves going to the beach. i asked [x] about spending time with his mother again. he gave mixed views. he said “i am not going near her without supervision” but then said that he wished his mother could come out to near where he lives. he said that he would like his mother to come and walk his dog with him. he went into a lot of detail about how the dog might manage this [i.e. whether the dog would jump all over his mother]. he said that he would also prefer his mother to come to the oval with him or go to his favourite fishing spot. [x] spoke very positively about his father. he said that his father generally does not speak about or to his mother. he said that his father can be annoying at times but that he appreciated that his father always organised things to do which he liked. he spoke about holidays, afternoon activities and sports. [x] said that the main difference [between his parents] is that his father tries to understand him whereas his mother always argues with him and wants things her way.
unfortunately, [x] has lived with constant parental conflict from his earliest life. in my view both his mother and father have utterly failed to protect him from their adult conflict and have continued a trajectory of aggression, and an inability to restrain themselves from high levels of conflict in front of [x]. [x]has been exposed to ongoing high levels of conflict between his parents and has become even further embroiled in their dispute. the parents have had conflict at [x]'s school, after school care, extracurricular activities and with health professionals. on numerous occasions the police have been involved to adjudicate their disputes. it appears that there are few places where [x] has experienced any sustained respite from his parents’ conflict.
in my view [x] has a fragile and volatile relationship with his mother. i have no doubt that [x] loves his mother and at times they have enjoyed a very close and intimate emotional bond. at certain times, i think that [x] enjoys the intimacy he has with his mother and regards her as capable of being loving, caring, and devoted to him. however, the relationship is very volatile and at other times [x] regards his mother as high conflict, embroiling him in the dispute with his father and placing him in a loyalty bind. i think that at times [x] has been embarrassed by his mother and found her to be a high conflict person. ... as [x] has become older, he does have a slightly better capacity to manage conflict and to avoid dramatic and unsafe scenarios. he is also much more likely to seek help when he conflicts with his mother. on the one hand, i think that there are minimal risks to his physical safety in the care of his mother but on the other hand, i think that it is likely that he will continue to behave aggressively towards his mother at times and that his mother does not have the requisite capacity to defuse and de-escalate these situations. ... ...there is some ongoing risk of [x] being exposed to psychological harm in spending time with his mother. however, this risk is mediated somewhat by [x]'s age, independence and capacity for help seeking. it also must be weighed against [x]'s desire to see and spend time with his mother.
... [x] has a very close relationship with his father, although it is a relationship that is characterised by high degree of dependence. in part, i think this is because of [x]'s age, personality, and overall global developmental delay. in general, i think that the father has provided [x] with positive affection, support, and managed to assuage [x]'s anxieties. however, i think that there has been an enormous blind spot in the father's parenting, insofar as he has involved [x] in the parenting proceedings and has been relatively unrestrained with his disdainful and times offensive comments about the mother. i think that the net effect is that [x] is very emotionally dependent on his father and wants to check many things with his father whenever he is feeling anxious or uncertain or unable to handle any situation. ... i do not think that [x] is exposed to any specific psychological harm in spending time with his father, aside from the concerns i expressed previously about the father's conflict with the mother, the father's denigration of the mother and the father's involvement of [x] in the dispute between the parents.
on the one hand, i think the mother has a very good capacity to provide for [x]'s needs including his emotional and intellectual needs. when [x] was younger it was very clear that the mother was highly motivated to ensure that he had every opportunity to improve his learning, social and physical outcomes. the mother has made special efforts to ensure that [x] has had multiple opportunities to address his learning needs and has availed herself of proper advice with respect to his needs. however, despite these strengths, the mother's lack of emotional regulation and poor communication with others has meant she has come into conflict with many professionals involved in [x]'s care. ... so, despite her good intentions, the mother's personality, behaviour and emotionality has meant that she has exposed [x] unnecessarily to high conflict situations and has been an extremely poor role model of positive communication and conflict resolution. as mentioned previously, i think that the mother also has a very limited capacity to regulate her emotions and have any insight into how she is perceived by others. this is extremely regrettable in circumstances where [x] himself has a great deal of vulnerability with respect to language and communication and needs the best exemplars of adult behaviour. not only is [x] at direct risk of being involved in constant arguments and situations of extreme emotional intensity, but he has also received very poor role modelling of appropriate adult behaviour.
i have mixed views about the father's capacity to provide for [x]'s needs including his emotional and intellectual needs. on the one hand, i think that the father has a very good capacity to be positive and encouraging of [x]. the father has focused on [x]'s strengths and does provide him with nurturing and reassurance. i think that [x] feels comfortable with his father and feels supported and well regarded. however, i am also mindful that the father has been less vigilant to some aspects of [x]'s care and has not always prioritised his urgent health and learning needs. i am very concerned that [x] has not returned to see [dr f], despite strong recommendations that she made to both parents more than 12 months ago... the father also, in his interview with me, appeared to minimise the significance and severity of [x]'s global developmental delay. in his affidavit of the father said, “ [x] is progressing well at school and is an average student”. this is completely at odds with all the diagnostic testing and professional opinion as to [x]'s abilities and special needs. whilst i understand that the father may be primarily motivated to view [x] in a positive light, the reality is that [x] needs considerable assistance with reading, learning, managing peer interactions and addressing the concerns with respect to his diet and weight. if these issues are not prioritised then [x] faces a range of physical, intellectual, and psychological risks. it is critically important that these needs are addressed appropriately. as mentioned previously, i think that there are also times when the father has failed to regulate his emotions and has exposed [x] inappropriately to adult conflict. the father has admitted that on a few occasions he has engaged in high levels of conflict with the mother, spoken to her appallingly and that he has done so in the presence of [x]. i note my review of some of the father's emails to the mother where he uses foul and disrespectful language to describe the mother. in the past the father has been physically threatening towards the mother in front of [x]. this represents very poor role modelling to [x] and causes him increased anxiety and distress and represents the father’s failure to prioritise [x]'s need for protection from conflict.
...if [x] were to spend substantially more time with his mother, then he would be at greater risk of anxiety and volatile and high conflict episodes. i think that [x] has an emotional dependence on his father that would mean that extended periods of time away from his father would cause him some distress and emotional regression. having said that, i think that there would also be a deleterious impact on [x] if he were to be estranged from his mother and maternal family on ongoing basis. despite the conflict and the risks, [x] loves his mother and appears to have some very positive relationships with maternal family members which are important to his sense of identity, stability, and psychological health.
i do not think that there is any utility in prohibiting [x] from contacting either of his parents, given his age and autonomy with his mobile telephone. however, i do think the parents both need a predetermined strategy in the case that [x] telephones his father when he is in the care of his mother. it may be the case that [ms g] can assist [x] [and communicate this to the parents] in having an expectation or understanding that although he may contact his father when he is in the care of his mother, that his mother will keep him safe and that his father will not subsequently contact the mother or involve himself in any conflict between [x] and his mother. it may be the case that [x] needs another neutral person to be able to contact in situations where he is concerned about escalating conflict with his mother. his uncle [mr j] [[mr j]], for example, may be able to perform such a role.
...[x] receives great benefit from having access to neutral therapeutic support with [ms g]. he has considerable needs with respect to his peer relationships, learning needs and dealing with the unrelenting family conflict. to that end, i think that he has established a very positive therapeutic relationship with [ms g] and that he should continue to have access to her support throughout his adolescent years. at a minimum, i think that [x] should see [ms g] each school term and more regularly if the need arises or as recommended by [ms g], or [x]'s school staff.   varga] told me that long terms she thinks [x] should attend a private school. she said she no longer thinks that [v school] is the right school but that [k school] would be a good school. she said that her brother has made enquiries and there are spaces at [k school]. she said she thinks that the peer interactions at a private school such as [k school] would be more positive for [x] and that a private school would be able to support his special needs. she said this would allow [x] to become independent and reach his full potential.
...however, he did say that he knows that his mother wants him to go to [v school]. he said that his mother had taken him there and to a lot of other schools. he said, “it never ended”. he said that he did not like [v school] because it seemed like a school that was very strict. he said that he loves his current school. he went on to say that his mother did not seem to like the principal of his primary school. [x] said that he has tried to tell his mother that he does not want to go to [v school] but that she does not seem to accept it. ... [x] said that he really likes his school. he said that he is “really happy there”. he said that he feels that he is mostly doing well academically. he described himself as “in the middle”. he said that there are some classes he loves, such as woodwork and pdh and other classes he does not like as much. he thought he had coped very well with having all the different teachers and showed me an app he had used to colour code his timetable. [x] said, “mum thinks the school is not helping me” and “mum hates it” but that he really wants to stay there.
...the reality is that whatever the merits of any school are, these will be completely eclipsed if [x] becomes embroiled in further conflict. the other important fact is that [x] is very happy at his current school, has settled into the peer relationships of high school and has no desire to change school. it would be very difficult under these circumstances to have him move from the only school he has known and to disrupt his established peer and learning relationships in the middle of high school.   having regard to the volatility in his relationship with the mother, x will benefit from the opportunity of a relationship with his mother, rather than the relationship being framed as an obligation within the orders, (b) x would be assisted by having the opportunity to spend day-only time with the mother on a non-sport day of alternate weekends. a few half day visits would allow x to more comfortably transition to a full day. block time in the school holidays was premature for the forthcoming summer holidays but could be considered next year, (c) x’s school, extra-curricular and medical environments need to be free of parental conflict for x so that he can concentrate on the task at hand and the social or other interactions that are occurring for him, (d) the mother’s attendance at the school on 31 october 2022, to which x reacted badly, illustrated that the mother lacked insight. the expert characterised the effect of x’s anxiety on his capacity to learn as an interfering variable. that is, some anxiety assists with better learning outcomes but there is a point at which it becomes unproductive. to ensure x’s school is a safe space for him, there should be a prohibition on parents attending the school unless it is part of a planned event and that, if a parent attends the school, there should be a prohibition on the other attending at the same time as these things are likely to produce anxiety in x: (e) x would be exposed to a high risk if both parents attend sporting events for x at the same time because of the anxiety that would produce for him, (f) there is no basis to expect that the risk posed by parental conflict will abate and that there is no realistic prospect of effective intervention in this regard, (g) the expert was uncertain of x’s current views about spending time with the mother because she has not spoken to him for a year and there is a current cessation of x spending time with her, (h) in terms of whether it is better to make positive orders or orders that are based on x’s views, the expert was concerned that non-compliance with positive orders may escalate parental conflict, place pressure on the father-son relationship and, if x were made to do something against his views, could result in a volatile or potentially violent interaction with the mother, which would expose x to a “whole different world of trouble”. on the other hand, orders that are based on x’s views would unfairly put pressure on x. the expert agreed that a better formulation would be to express times in the orders that would signal to x what responsible adults think are in his best interests and requiring the father to use his best endeavours to encourage x to take up the opportunity to spend time with the mother, (i) the court could have greater confidence in the father’s capacity to facilitate x’s relationship with the mother than the reverse. her assessment of x was that he had not been “alienated” from his mother. this was based on the fact that x could provide a balance view about the mother, (j) x has little capacity to self-soothe and, at times when he is heightened, needs an adult to help him calm down, rather than to argue back in a “battle for the truth”. an example of this was the “sunscreen incident” described at page 40 of the expert’s report. the expert opined that adolescents are generally vulnerable in this area but x is especially vulnerable given his cognitive delay. when x is heightened, he needs time to calm down as he views his situation in black and white terms. once calm, there may then be an opportunity for repair and recovery. the expert illustrated this by reference to the occasions where x has refused to see the mother after a volatile event and it has taken several weeks or months before he is ready to re-engage with her, (k) x has excellent relationships with his maternal uncle and maternal grandmother. these relationships, if fostered by the father, can provide benefits to x including the assurance that there are people who care for him, form part of his identity, and can be a “gateway” for x to take up the opportunity to have meaningful time with the mother, (l) of the father’s attention to x’s diet and medical advice, including that blood tests that were due in september 2022 have not been conducted, the expert opined that a well-engaged parent would have ensured this occurred on time. the expert opined that the father has demonstrated a passive approach to x’s health which reflects poorly on him, (m) the mother is more aware of x’s health needs and has been rightfully concerned about x’s diet, exercise, obesity, and learning needs. there may be utility in the parents sharing parental responsibility for health as a way of keeping the father accountable, given the mother has been more diligent in this regard but expressed no concluded opinion, (n) x’s relationship with his father is a major strength for x. while the expert was critical of the father in many ways, such as passivity relating to health care, the father is nurturing of x and keeps him calm. x has experienced too much involvement with the court, police and bystanders which has negatively affected x. the expert opined that x needs privacy in his adolescence, (o) x does not have any problematic behavioural issues, based on her own interactions with him and third party sources such as school records. that said, x has limitations in his own ability to emotionally regulate, hence the need for calm parenting. the need to set behavioural boundaries for x was not a priority in the circumstances. the greater need is for x to remain calm, relatively free of anxiety and to give him respite from parental conflict, (p) the expert was unable to make any firm recommendations about x’s telephone communication with the mother other than ensuring the x is always free to telephone his father when in his mother’s care. if x is unable to call his father at those times, he may feel trapped, which will be counterproductive to his relationship with the mother, (q) x’s current school is adequately meeting his special needs, (r) year 9 is a difficult year to change school because there are established social groupings at that time. usual school entry points for high school are year 7 and year 11. x is settled and happy where he is and that is a “big asset” for him. further, it is very difficult to move a child’s schooling against their wishes as an unhappy child may refuse to go to school. even if x is not getting the best learning at his current school, this is outweighed by other benefits to x which should not be lost in favour of the perceived advantage of a different school, and (s) changeover is a point of vulnerability and risk for x as the parents may come into contact and conflict. x would feel better supported and more likely to visit his mother if the father drives him to the mother at the start of the time and collects him at the end of the time.   x would be assisted by having the opportunity to spend day-only time with the mother on a non-sport day of alternate weekends. a few half day visits would allow x to more comfortably transition to a full day. block time in the school holidays was premature for the forthcoming summer holidays but could be considered next year, (c) x’s school, extra-curricular and medical environments need to be free of parental conflict for x so that he can concentrate on the task at hand and the social or other interactions that are occurring for him, (d) the mother’s attendance at the school on 31 october 2022, to which x reacted badly, illustrated that the mother lacked insight. the expert

uncle and maternal grandmother. these relationships, if fostered by the father, can provide benefits to x including the assurance that there are people who care for him, form part of his identity, and

x’s health which reflects poorly on him, (m) the mother is more aware of x’s health needs and has been rightfully concerned about x’s diet, exercise, obesity, and learning needs. there may be utility

relationship with his father is a major strength for x. while the expert was critical of the father in many ways, such as passivity relating to health care, the father is nurturing of x and keeps him calm. x has experienced too much involvement with the court, police and bystanders which has negatively affected x. the expert opined that x needs privacy in his adolescence, (o) x does not have any problematic behavioural issues, based on her own interactions with him and third party sources such as school records. that said, x has limitations in his own ability to emotionally regulate, hence the need for calm parenting. the need to set behavioural boundaries for x was not a priority in the circumstances. the greater need is for x to remain calm, relatively free of anxiety and to give him respite from parental conflict, (p) the expert was unable to make any firm recommendations about x’s telephone communication with the mother other than ensuring the x is always free to telephone his father when in his mother’s care. if x is unable to call his father at those times, he may feel trapped, which will be counterproductive to his relationship with the mother, (q) x’s current school is adequately meeting his special needs, (r) year 9 is a difficult year to change school because there are established social groupings at that time. usual school entry points for high school are year 7 and year 11. x is settled and happy where he is and that is a “big asset” for him. further, it is very difficult to move a child’s schooling against their wishes as an unhappy child may refuse to go to school. even if x is not getting the best learning at his current school, this is outweighed by other benefits to x which should not be lost in favour of the perceived advantage of a different school, and (s) changeover is a point of vulnerability and risk for x as the parents may come into contact and conflict. x would feel better supported and more likely to visit his mother if the father drives him to the mother at the start of the time and collects him at the end of the time.   x’s school, extra-curricular and medical environments need to be free of parental conflict for x so that he can concentrate on the task at hand and the social or other interactions that are occurring for him, (d) the mother’s attendance at the school on 31 october 2022, to which x reacted badly, illustrated that the mother lacked insight. the expert characterised the effect of x’s anxiety on his capacity to learn as an interfering variable. that is, some anxiety assists with better learning outcomes but there is a point at which it becomes unproductive. to ensure x’s school is a safe space for him, there should be a prohibition on parents attending the school unless it is part of a planned event and that, if a parent attends the school, there should be a prohibition on the other attending at the same time as these things are likely to produce anxiety in x: (e) x would be exposed to a high risk if both parents attend sporting events for x at the same time because of the anxiety that would produce for him, (f) there is no basis to expect that the risk posed by parental conflict will abate and that there is no realistic prospect of effective intervention in this regard, (g) the expert was uncertain of x’s current views about spending time with the mother because she has not spoken to him for a year and there is a current cessation of x spending time with her, (h) in terms of whether it is better to make positive orders or orders that are based on x’s views, the expert was concerned that non-compliance with positive orders may escalate parental conflict, place pressure on the father-son relationship and, if x were made to do something against his views, could result in a volatile or potentially violent interaction with the mother, which would expose x to a “whole different world of trouble”. on the other hand, orders that are based on x’s views would unfairly put pressure on x. the expert agreed that a better formulation would be to express times in the orders that would signal to x what responsible adults think are in his best interests and requiring the father to use his best endeavours to encourage x to take up the opportunity to spend time with the mother, (i) the court could have greater confidence in the father’s capacity to facilitate x’s relationship with the mother than the reverse. her assessment of x was that he had not been “alienated” from his mother. this was based on the fact that x could provide a balance view about the mother, (j) x has little capacity to self-soothe and, at times when he is heightened, needs an adult to help him calm down, rather than to argue back in a “battle for the truth”. an example of this was the “sunscreen incident” described at page 40 of the expert’s report. the expert opined that adolescents are generally vulnerable in this area but x is especially vulnerable given his cognitive delay. when x is

vulnerable in this area but x is especially vulnerable given his cognitive delay. when x is heightened, he needs time to calm down as he views his situation in black and white terms. once calm, there

weeks or months before he is ready to re-engage with her, (k) x has excellent relationships with his maternal uncle and maternal grandmother. these relationships, if fostered by the father, can

and third party sources such as school records. that said, x has limitations in his own ability to emotionally regulate, hence the need for calm parenting. the need to set behavioural boundaries for x
