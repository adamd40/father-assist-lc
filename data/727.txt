the relevant legal principles
these rights, and the right of freedom of mobility of a parent, only defer to the paramount consideration of a child’s best interests where those interests would be so adversely affected as to justify such interference, and then the interference is legitimate only to the extent that it is necessary to avoid such adverse effects.   the best interests of the children are the paramount, but not the sole consideration, (b) the person seeking to move does not need to provide compelling reasons for the relocation sought, (c) the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the children's best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children's best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the person seeking to move does not need to provide compelling reasons for the relocation sought, (c) the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the children's best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children's best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the children's best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children's best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children's best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children's best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.
in some cases, the determination of "best interests" may well mean that one party's choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child's "best interests" being served by orders which do not give one parent "optimal" arrangements or outcomes.
a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.
parental responsibility
the considerations pursuant to section 60cc of the act   the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents, and (b) the need to protect children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
meaningful relationship
protection from harm
the additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to those views
the nature of the children’s relationship with each of their parents and other significant persons in their lives
the extent to which the children’s parents have taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in long-term decision making in relation to the children, to spend time and to communicate with the children
the extent to which each of the children’s parents have fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of a change in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect of a separation from a parent or other significant persons in their lives
from the writer's perspective such a move would be detrimental to the children's relationship with [mr montague], remove them from their current community connections and would likely adversely impact upon the children's wellbeing. as such, it was considered that [x] and [y] should remain in sa [south australia] and their relationships with [ms elliott] and [mr montague] be supported and encouraged.
the practical difficulty and expense associated with the children spending time and communicating with a parent, and whether that difficulty substantially affects the children’s right to maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of the children’s parents and any other significant person to provide for their needs, including their emotional and intellectual needs
whilst [ms elliott] maintained that the children's development had been compromised by their experiences of neglect and abuse, the writer noted that in meeting with the children they did not present with developmental or social issues.
minimal concerns were raised about [ms elliott's] care of [x] and [y] and it appeared that they were excited to spend time with her and responsive to her care. (as per the original)
of note was that whilst [ms elliott] was keen to act as the primary carer for the children, it appeared that she struggled to consider the impact this may have on the children's relationship with [mr montague] or recognise the role he had played in the children's lives more recently. instead, she appeared keen to reinforce the concerns she held about his care and his interactions with the children.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and their parents, and any other characteristics of the children the court thinks relevant
if the children are aboriginal or torres strait islander children
attitude to the child, and to the responsibility of parenthood demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
whilst upset by [ms elliott's] past behaviours, it was noted that [mr montague] did not appear to overly denigrate [ms elliott] and he repeatedly stated the importance of the children maintaining a relationship with her. overall, [mr montague] impressed as a father who was trying to ensure his children's safety whilst also wishing to provide them with ongoing connections to their main carers.
any family violence involving the children or a member of their family, and if a family violence order applies or has applied, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order   elliott] reported that over time, [mr montague] became "worse" towards her and started physically assaulting her. for example, [ms elliott] recalled that on one occasion when she accidentally brushed [mr montague]'s leg, he retaliated by allegedly grabbing her by the throat and giving [ms elliott] a "black eye". she further noted that when she was in bed there were "plenty" of times [mr montague] used to "choke" her. due to the location of the incidents, [ms elliott] reported that at the time she "didn't know whether it was real or a dream" and she became "scared" of [mr montague] as he had the "ability to be very nice and horrid".   elliott's] current version of events appeared to contradict multiple discussions she had with other professionals, during which she appeared to minimise concerns about her relationship with [mr montague] and spoke about positive attributes.
according to [mr montague], [ms elliott] became more controlling over "everything" in their lives including criticising him for the way he folded laundry, his time in the toilet and who he was talking to on his phone. alongside this, [mr montague] reported that [ms elliott] verbally abused him "everyday" and no matter what he did, he was "verbally attacked". specifically, [mr montague] recalled being repeatedly put down, sworn at and physically assaulted, including recalling an incident in which [ms elliott] "kicked" him in the back of the "calves and hit" him in the back of the head, when he returned to the bedroom. [mr montague] further noted that at the time, [ms elliott] told him to "shut the fuck up you cunt, if you wake [x], i'll kill you".
