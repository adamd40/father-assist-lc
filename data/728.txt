1.4 “the c trust trading as town b resort”.
in summary, the property can only be assessed in its current state as a large rural-zoned beachfront reserve lot with future potential for rezoning subject to extensive studies and council approval.
the site has been identified and accepted by council as a future medium density zone. this new zoning will come into effect in the new lep which at this stage may occur in 2023. the new zoning provides significant development opportunity for the provision of medium density housing in a unique beachfront location. such medium density development could occur by conversion of the existing tourist units to a residential use, or complete redevelopment of the site to provide a new medium density development. such locations available for development of the [sic] nature are becoming very rare in coastal beachfront location [sic] in new south wales. in our opinion the future development potential significantly increases the value of the land. given the current zoning of the land is rural, it would not be unexpected that the site could realise a land value increase of between 250 - 400 % when the new medium density zoning comes into effect.
weighing the merits of the application
the court does not consider that the offer makes any difference to the outcome of the husband’s application to re-open the evidence.
