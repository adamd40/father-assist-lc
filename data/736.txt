reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
the wife’s evidence
i now know that [mr pender] was living well beyond his means, spending a lot of money on overseas travel, both for work and also for pleasure, visiting family and friends in the usa. i did not know how much he was spending as he was managing all of our accounts at the time.[7]
the wife’s current situation
for the purpose of determining a current lump sum value of the payments under the pension plan, i have treated the payments as if they were pension payments being made from an australian superannuation fund and valued them under the relevant factors and approach on that basis. this means that i am applying the economic and mortality assumptions that are used in the australian family law system. i regard this approach as providing an objective estimate of the present day value of the pension payments. i have interpreted the information from the payment slip that the total monthly pension payment of us $5,440.81 is comprised of: us $4,685.00 fixed monthly retirement benefit, and us $755.81 variable monthly retirement benefit.[8]
the nature of an undefended hearing
the legal principles applicable
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[20]
as a result of those matters, the court’s approach to s 79/s90sm may be less compartmentalised than what a strict or unthinking adherence to four (or three) “steps” might otherwise reveal. the task is essentially holistic, is it just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the particular relationship or marriage under consideration to make an order and, if so, its terms must similarly meet that criteria. of course, holistic though the approach is, it must be referenced to what the act requires and care must be taken to ensure that the court’s reasons make that clear.[21]
where the court has determined that it is just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79(2) or s 90sm(3) and there is clear evidence that one party has engaged in conduct and, but for that conduct, the legal and equitable interests of a party or the parties (or the value of those interests) would have be significantly greater, justice and equity may require recognition of the unfairness inherent in those circumstances in the terms of the orders to be made. how might that be recognised? first, consistent with existing authority, it can be recognised pursuant to s 75(2)(o) (cf s 90sf(3)(r)) (see, for example, omacini & omacini [2005] famcafc 104, (2005) flc 93-218, browne & green [1999] famca 1483, (1999) flc 92-873 and cerini). secondly, it might be contended that it might be recognised within the assessment of contributions. this court has long eschewed the notion of “negative contributions” (see, for example, antmann & antmann [1980] famca 64, (1980) flc 90-908). nevertheless, it might be argued that the “non-dissipating party” can be seen to have made a disproportionally greater indirect contribution to the existing legal and equitable interests (for example to their preservation) if it is established that, but for the other party’s unilateral dissipation, those existing legal and equitable interests would have been greater or had a greater value. the assessment of the circumstance under discussion is, ultimately, a matter of discretion (see, for example, cerini at [46] and townsend at 81,654). equally, however, authority dictates that it will be “the exception rather than the rule” (cerini at [46]) that a direct dollar adjustment equivalent to the amount of the alleged dissipation of the pool is made to the otherwise entitlement of a party. it may be that aspects of the erstwhile treatment of legal fees pre-stanford (see, for example, chorn & hopkins [2004] famca 633, (2004) flc 93-204) will require further consideration in an appropriate case. importantly, of course, as has been emphasised in many authorities including those cited above, not every dissipation by a party can be seen to involve an affront to justice and equity, again the circumstances of the individual relationship must be assessed.[24]
two fundamental premises emerge from omacini and the authorities preceding it. first, ‘adding back’ is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not ‘exceptional’ justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is ‘a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct’ than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.
