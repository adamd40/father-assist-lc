reasons for judgment
judge morley:
property
parenting
it is positive that both parents agree that [x] should continue to live with [mr chao] and remain in his primary care. it seems that [x] would benefit from spending time that is more frequent with his mother given that they were observed to share a positive relationship. at [xâ€™s] age, time should be more frequent rather than long blocks of time. it may be beneficial for [x] to spend weekend time with [ms jingyi], for example, each alternate weekend to allow for more quality time between [x] and his mother.
