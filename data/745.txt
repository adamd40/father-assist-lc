legal principles
the principles which, in my view, should apply in such cases are that the court should have regard to any earlier order into the reasons for material on which that order was based. it should not lightly entertain an application to reverse an earlier custody order. to do so would be to invite endless litigation... change is an ever present factor in human affairs. therefore, the court would need to be satisfied by the applicant that... there is some changed circumstance which will justify such a serious step, some new factor arising or, at any rate, some factor which was not disclosed at the previous hearing which would have been material.
nevertheless, there are significant changes that occur and which do require a court to reconsider decisions previously made. whether in a particular case a court should be willing to embark upon another hearing concerning the child and parent, or whether to do so would itself be demonstrably contrary to the best interests of the child, is a decision to be made in each particular case. how is that decision to be made? the court must look at: (1) the past circumstances, including the reasons for the decision and the evidence upon which it was based. (2) whether there is a likelihood of orders being varied in a significant way, as a result of a new hearing. (3) if there is such a likelihood, the nature of the likely changes must be weighed against the potential detriment to the child or children caused by the litigation itself. thus, for example, small changes may not have sufficient benefit to compensate for the disruption caused by significant re-litigation.
the father’s identification of changed circumstances ] while as is often the case the truth of the matter lies somewhere in the middle of the accounts provided by the parties, influenced by differing perspectives and perception it was nonetheless, concluded by the writer that [ms kaplan] appears to have misrepresented to a large degree the history of [mr kaplan]'s behaviour and her current degree of co-operation and encouragement of the relationship between the children and [mr kaplan]. further to this it does appear that there is a high degree of denigration and negativity relayed to the children about [mr kaplan] and notwithstanding her statements at interview with the writer, it appears more likely that [ms kaplan] has actively sought to remove [mr kaplan] from the children's lives and seeks to undermine the relationship between them. [85] while a change of primary caregiver does not appear in the children's best interests at this time, there needs to be a very strong consideration and therefore message provided to [ms kaplan] that should the current style of interactions and blocking of the relationship between the children and [mr kaplan] continue that: firstly, the impact upon the children's wellbeing is likely to be profoundly damaging and secondly, would likely result in serious consideration of a change of primary residence for the children on the basis that a significant and substantial relationship with both parents is in the children's best interests. should [ms kaplan]'s encouragement and facilitation of the relationship not change [mr kaplan] is more likely and better able to actively co-facilitate the relationship between the children and [ms kaplan] than [ms kaplan] has been doing.  ] while a change of primary caregiver does not appear in the children's best interests at this time, there needs to be a very strong consideration and therefore message provided to [ms kaplan] that should the current style of interactions and blocking of the relationship between the children and [mr kaplan] continue that: firstly, the impact upon the children's wellbeing is likely to be profoundly damaging and secondly, would likely result in serious consideration of a change of primary residence for the children on the basis that a significant and substantial relationship with both parents is in the children's best interests. should [ms kaplan]'s encouragement and facilitation of the relationship not change [mr kaplan] is more likely and better able to actively co-facilitate the relationship between the children and [ms kaplan] than [ms kaplan] has been doing.
