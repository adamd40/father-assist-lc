the court orders until further order:

reasons for judgmentex tempore
judge t. young
background
...landed between the edge of the safety sleeper as she was spinning. her foot stayed in one position while her body continued rotating, which caused her to fall down on the mattress.
running around dancing this morning and fell into her bed. she stayed in her floor bed and then, when trying to get up, there was pain.
dancing and unwitnessed. foot stuck in rail.
“[mr b] broke me, [mr b] scary.”
the child is described as non-verbal in some material, but it appears that she is able to verbalise to some degree. it is noteworthy that the child did not make any complaint about mr b to any third party such as dr d, the radiographer, or the doctor at c hospital on 10 march 2022. i am not persuaded that this further evidence should tip the weight in favour of a finding of an unacceptable risk of harm.
