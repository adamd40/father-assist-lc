the relevant law
standard of proof  in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.
reliability & credibility ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events...  tations omitted)  ] first, we question the nature of the credit findings and, more importantly, the need for many, if not all, of them to have been made in the first place.
...  ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (“carlson”) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case: as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. to deny significant limitations in the capacity to use assessment of the demeanour of a witness as an entirely reliable guide to his or her truthfulness would be to deny the existence of plausible liars, or those who may be timid, uncertain or unconvincing, but nevertheless truthful, in relating events. moderation in this respect is also called for when it is recognised that adverse credit findings in arriving at a decision at first instance may present a significant hurdle to legitimate rights of review of that decision on appeal. these observations apply with at least equal, if not greater, force in parenting proceedings such as these in this court where the decision does not bring an end to the litigants’ relationship. these parties are, and will remain, the parents of d and k and adverse credit findings in this decision carry the inherent risk that, rather than bringing an end to long-standing conflictual issues, they may be embraced as vindication for the pursuit of further conflict in the future. moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide. [90] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.  ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.
section 4 interpretation "major long-term issues" , in relation to a child, means issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about:   the child's education (both current and future), and (b) the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.
to avoid doubt, a decision by a parent of a child to form a relationship with a new partner is not, of itself, a major long-term issue in relation to the child. however, the decision will involve a major long-term issue if, for example, the relationship with the new partner involves the parent moving to another area and the move will make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with the other parent. section 4ab definition of family violence etc. (1) for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family (the family member ), or causes the family member to be fearful.

... section 61da presumption of equal shared parental responsibility when making parenting orders (1) when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. (2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   family violence.   when the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order. (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. section 65daa court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances equal time (1) subject to subsection (6), if a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child's parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, the court must: (a) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (b) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents. ... substantial and significant time (2) subject to subsection (6), if: (a) a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child's parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, and (b) the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents,   consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (b) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child's parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, and (b) the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents,   the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents,
the court must: (c) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (d) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.   consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (d) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.   consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.   if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.
... (3) for the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend substantial and significant time with a parent only if:   the time the child spends with the parent includes both:  days that fall on weekends and holidays, and (ii) days that do not fall on weekends or holidays, and (b) the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in: (i) the child's daily routine, and (ii) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child, and (c) the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:  ) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child, and (c) the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant. reasonable practicality (5) in determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child's parents, the court must have regard to:   how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   such other matters as the court considers relevant.

15aa interpretation best achieving act’s purpose or object in interpreting a provision of an act, the interpretation that would best achieve the purpose or object of the act (whether or not that purpose or object is expressly stated in the act) is to be preferred to each other interpretation. 1] in mills v meeking dawson j in the high court provided the following explanation of the effect of the equivalent victorian provision as follows:
...the literal rule of construction, whatever the qualifications with which it is expressed, must give way to a statutory injunction to prefer a construction which would promote the purpose of an act to one which would not, especially where that purpose is set out in the act. ... the requirement that a court look to the purpose or object of the act is thus more than an instruction to adopt the traditional mischief or purpose rule in preference to the literal rule of construction. the mischief or purpose rule required an ambiguity or inconsistency before a court could have regard to purpose ... the approach required by s 35 needs no ambiguity or inconsistency, it allows a court to consider the purposes of an act in determining whether there is more than one possible construction. ... section 35 requires a court to construe an act, not to rewrite it, in the light of its purposes. (footnotes omitted) 2] it follows that s 15aa (and equivalent provisions in state legislation) do not permit a court to ignore the actual words of a statute and a court is bound to give effect to clear language in a statute even if in the court’s opinion the result might be anomalous or unfair. [113] in this context there is ample authority for the general principle that courts are not at liberty to consider any word or sentence in legislation as superfluous or insignificant. prima facie, all words in a statute must be given some meaning and effect. [114] that principle has been held to be more compelling if the words or phrases used in the legislation have been added by amendment ...

[our emphasis]  9] the act does not contain a definition of “meaningful”, nor does it provide any specific criteria to assess how parents either have, or should have, a “meaningful involvement” in a child’s life. it does not give guidance to the interpretation of the phrase “meaningful relationship”. [110] it is necessary we construe the language of the statute to determine whether the import of the legislation is clear without reference to extrinsic material. [111] the macquarie dictionary defines the adjective “meaningful” as “full of meaning, significant. significant is defined as “important, of consequence”.  0] it is necessary we construe the language of the statute to determine whether the import of the legislation is clear without reference to extrinsic material. [111] the macquarie dictionary defines the adjective “meaningful” as “full of meaning, significant. significant is defined as “important, of consequence”.  1] the macquarie dictionary defines the adjective “meaningful” as “full of meaning, significant. significant is defined as “important, of consequence”.  4] section 15aa of the acts interpretation act 1901 (cth) provides for a purposive construction of a statute. [115] the phrase “meaningful relationship” in the context of s 60cc(3)(a) has, not surprisingly, been considered in a number of decisions since the introduction of the amending act. in mazorski & albright [2007] famca 520, (2007) 37 fam lr 518 brown j, after setting out the definition of “meaningful” and “meaning”, said at paragraph 26:  5] the phrase “meaningful relationship” in the context of s 60cc(3)(a) has, not surprisingly, been considered in a number of decisions since the introduction of the amending act. in mazorski & albright [2007] famca 520, (2007) 37 fam lr 518 brown j, after setting out the definition of “meaningful” and “meaning”, said at paragraph 26:
what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one ... 6] kay j sitting in the appellate jurisdiction of the court as a single judge in godfrey & sanders (2007) famca 102 (an appeal involving an application by a mother to relocate) (observed)agreed with dessau j’s exposition in m & s (formerly e) [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 of the effect of the amending act ... and later at paragraph 36 said:
... even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship. 7] bennett j discussed the terminology in g & c [2006] famca 994 and said the enquiry was a “prospective” one which requires a court to evaluate the extent to which a meaningful or significant relationship with both parents is going to be of advantage a child.  1] in coming to our conclusions we accept as appropriate the interpretation of “meaningful relationship” set out by brown j in mazsorski. consistently with our conclusions we also agree with the reasoning of bennett j in g & c.
...to the maximum extent, consistent with the best interests of the child.  ] as another example, the principle of legality “requires that statutes be construed, where constructional choices are open, to avoid or minimise their encroachment upon rights and freedoms at common law” (momcilovic v the queen (2011) 245 clr 1 per french cj at [43]).  ] the law is not limited to the express words of the statute. [21] in relation to the present issue kirby j explained it in ams v aif: secondly, it is important to remember that in australia, whilst the welfare (or best interests) of the child are, by statute, the “paramount” consideration in the exercise of jurisdiction such as was invoked here, they are not the sole consideration. ... whilst the legislation considered in this case, and later statutory reforms, give the highest priority to the child’s welfare and best interests, that consideration does not expel every other relevant interest from receiving its due weight. in part, this is because (as the english courts recognised long ago) the enjoyment by parents of their freedoms necessarily impinges on the happiness of the child. but, in part, it is also because legislation such as fla 1975 and fca 1975 is enacted to take effect within a society of a particular character whose members enjoy a high measure of personal freedom, diminished only to the extent that the law obliges.  tnotes omitted)
...to the maximum extent, consistent with the best interests of the child
is used. i do not disregard this aspect of the objects of part vii of the act, but i am guided by the many observations of the full court which bind me.  ] there is an inherent tension between, on the one hand, separated parents being able to establish new homes wherever they like and, on the other, their restraint by injunction from living too far apart to avoid any impingement of their children’s ability to retain meaningful relationships with both parents. the conflict is between the best interests of the children to know and have regular personal contact with each parent and the interests of the parents to enjoy a high measure of freedom of movement which is not lost by reason only of their parental responsibility for the children (see ms v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 ... at 196, 206, 207-208, 210). the tension at the intersection of those conflicting interests is even greater when an order is sought, not just to restrain one parent’s move further away, but to compel the parent who has already moved away to return and establish a new residence closer to the other parent. [28] while the children’s interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii of the act (ams v aif at 207, 225, 230, u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 ... at 282). parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children (see ams v aif at 223-224, 231-232, sampson and hartnett (no.10) [2007] famca 1365, (2007) flc 93-350, zanda & zanda [2014] famcafc 173, (2014) flc 93-607 at [132] - [136]). only when the children’s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent’s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children’s best interests (see u v u at 262).  ] while the children’s interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii of the act (ams v aif at 207, 225, 230, u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 ... at 282). parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children (see ams v aif at 223-224, 231-232, sampson and hartnett (no.10) [2007] famca 1365, (2007) flc 93-350, zanda & zanda [2014] famcafc 173, (2014) flc 93-607 at [132] - [136]). only when the children’s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent’s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children’s best interests (see u v u at 262).  ] it must be remembered that the family law act 1975 (cth), (“the act”) does not obligate a court to ensure a child maintains a meaningful relationship with both parents: mulvaney & lane [2009] famcafc 76, (2009) flc 93-404 at [89]. rather, the court must consider the benefit to a child of having such relationships. ...  0] although we recognise kirby j was in the minority in the outcome in u v u, we nevertheless would adopt the following passage from his reasons: ... treating the wife's refusal to abandon her child and her expression of willingness (if necessary) to stay with the child in australia as an ‘alternative proposal’ requires, in effect, that parent to show ‘good’ or ‘compelling’ reasons to relocate, given that doing so will always make it more difficult (and in some cases virtually impossible) for physical contact between the other parent and the child to be maintained. such an approach stacks the cards unfairly against the custodial/residence parent ...  4] the only proper finding on the evidence here was that the mother did not “contemplate” living in perth any more than the father “contemplated” living in [town d]. it was therefore impermissible for the acting magistrate to proceed on the basis that the mother was “prepared” to continue living in perth. ... [105] we accept, as was said by gummow and callinan jj in u v u at [80] and [72] that “the court is not, on any view, bound by the proposals of the parties” and that “the parties in cases concerning the welfare of children do not define the issues”. however, as hayne j said in the same case (with the concurrence of gleeson cj and mchugh j): that is not to say that the family court is to embark upon some roving inquiry about the matter, unfettered by any regard for the evidence led and the matters which the parties seek to contest. due account must be taken of the fact that proceedings in the family court are conducted in a framework of adversarial procedure familiar to the common law. (i do not stay to consider how or to what extent that adversarial model has been modified by the act or rules of court made under it.)

even allowing for the caveat in the last sentence cited from hayne j, the court cannot manufacture an alternative proposal with respect to residence when one does not exist. ] it is a now well established principle that, whilst some special requirements may apply, relocation cases are guided and judicial officers bound by the same legislative pathways as other parenting cases under the act. in other words, relocation is not to be treated as a discrete issue in the making of parenting orders (see morgan and miles [2007] famca 1230, (2007) flc 93-343 at paragraphs 72 to 73, palmer & hammer (no 2) [2011] famcafc 196 at paragraph 28). [48] a requirement in relocation cases is that judges faced with a parent wanting to relocate must consider the competing proposals of both parents (see palmer & hammer (no 2) paragraph 76, morgan and miles paragraphs 80 to 81). it is not simply a matter of comparing the relocating party’s proposal against the status quo and allowing or denying relocation. rather the court must consider each party’s proposal on its merits, in accordance with the prescribed legislative pathway.  ] a requirement in relocation cases is that judges faced with a parent wanting to relocate must consider the competing proposals of both parents (see palmer & hammer (no 2) paragraph 76, morgan and miles paragraphs 80 to 81). it is not simply a matter of comparing the relocating party’s proposal against the status quo and allowing or denying relocation. rather the court must consider each party’s proposal on its merits, in accordance with the prescribed legislative pathway.  ] it is well settled that a trial judge must consider the competing proposals of the parties in accordance with the legislative pathway (sayer v radcliffe [2012] famcafc 209, (2012) 48 fam lr 298 at [48] (“sayer”)). at [49] of sayer, the full court summarises that legislative pathway which must, naturally, include a consideration of s 65daa(5) of the act.  ] in [this] case that would involve the following:   identifying the competing proposals of the parties, (b) identifying the issues in dispute in [this] hearing, (c) identifying any agreed or uncontested relevant facts, (d) considering the matters in s 60cc that are relevant and, if possible, making findings about them ...
