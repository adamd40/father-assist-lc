on the 23rd of november 2022, about 8:00pm [x] required to urgently use the toilet. the defendant took [x] to the bathroom to use the toilet, where [x] missed the toilet and urinated on the tiles of the bathroom. the defendant open hand slapped [x] on the left side of her buttocks leaving a visible handprint and welt from the assault. the assault was witnessed by [y], the older sister of [x], who was in the bathroom when the incident occurred.
it says that:
about 3.15pm [mr mattias] picked up the pinops from school in [suburb b]. upon picking the pinop’s up [x] begun to complain about her buttocks stating she was in pain. [mr mattias] asked what had happened and [y] stated that [x] was struck by the defendant. [mr mattias] located a large handprint and welts on the left side of [x]’s buttocks. [mr mattias] captured photos of the marks. on the 24th of november 2022, [mr mattias] dropped the pinop’s off to school where [x] continued to complain of pain. [mr mattias] later returned to the pinop’s school about 11:00am and spoke with the school principal and captured another photo of the injury. the injury was still visible and the photo’s depict red handprints. further bruises have formed where the assault occurred on [x]. [mr mattias] attended [suburb b] police station to report the matter to the police. due to family court orders and recent allegations of assault, police hold concerns for the pinop’s. police believe that a provisional apprehended domestic violence order is necessary for the pinops safety and to reduce the escalation of any further offences.
the father relies upon those facts. the father also says that there are further marks including some marks on the little girl’s shoulder blade.
