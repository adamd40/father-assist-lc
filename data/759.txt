the history of the parties parenting arrangements evidence a recurring pattern of conflict disruptive to the stability and happiness for the children. this is clearly not in the interests of the children..... whether or not there is truth in the allegations about physical discipline, there seems to be an increasing rift in [the elder child]’s relationship with his mother and step-father. the cause of this cannot presently be determined. it is predictable given the history since at least 2018, that there will be ongoing difficulties between these parties. the veracity of each parent's account has never been tested nor determined by a court. until that occurs, there is a strong likelihood that each party will continue to promote their own causes in a manner that is highly dysfunctional to the children. the contents of the css report and social work notes overwhelmingly demonstrate adverse impact on the children from the parties’ behaviours. neither party has fully engaged with the recommendations in the child inclusive memorandum, but instead have chosen a litigious pathway. there has been delay in instigating family therapy, delay in undertaking parenting programs and the court has received no information about the father engaging in the caring dad's program or progress of the mother engaging in family violence counselling. although i was informed that the father had sought out psychological counselling, i was told that there is delay in accessing that on the [region d]. i am doubtful that the course urged upon me by the icl will prevent the children from being exposed to ongoing conflict due to the dysfunction in co-parenting......equally, i am not persuaded to make the orders sought in the father’s application in the case. i am gravely concerned that there is a clear pattern of repeat allegations by the mother against the father and by the father against the mother. i do not know to what extent [the elder child] is manipulating the situation. i have reviewed the materials filed in the 2018 proceedings, they contain reports that the mother was subjected to family violence, but i have limited evidence of that to date before me. similarly the allegations relating to the father’s drug use and mental health are unsubstantiated at this stage. interestingly, the allegations made against the mother presently were similar in 2018.

the father’s evidence  he does variable contract work earning between $100 and $400 per week and otherwise relies on centrelink as his primary source of income,[24] (b) a typical day involves the elder child and him getting up at 7:30am, the elder child having opportunity for breakfast and getting ready for school. they leave home around 8:10am and he drops the elder child at school at around 8:40am. he then returns home and does work or housework as required and sometimes has a nap as he is not a great sleeper. he used to drive to town h to collect the elder child from school, but that has changed as he now gets a bus home,[25] (c) he persisted in obtaining information about how the elder child can get a bus home because of the cost of him making two return trips to the school each day. the investigations and enquiries took months, and he was pretty frustrated by the misinformation which he had been given during this process,[26] (d) he considers the mother has positive values such as being compassionate, has a good regime, is personable or effervescent, bubbly, strict and firm which may be overbearing at times for the children,[27] (e) he admitted he had also described the mother as narcissistic, self-absorbed, ignorant and self-righteous. he agreed that he dislikes the mother,[28] (f) he had on many occasions tried to agree an amicable arrangement with the mother about the children spending time with her and a reasonable amount of time with him, but has received nothing but hostility and condescending remarks,[29] (g) the blame for not reaching an agreement is not only the mother’s, and he admits he could have remained calmer instead of being loud and insisting,[30] (h) the father gave evidence about the health-related issues for both children and his desire to be involved in decision making about them, which have been entirely dealt with by the mother satisfactorily to date,[31] (i) the father maintained he had consistently tried to have the elder child spend time with his mother, but was not successful except on very limited occasions,[32] (j) he had changed his attitude to potential consent orders after july 2022 due to the allegations that he influenced the younger child to make a false claim that the mother hit him with a wooden spoon, and also what he described as the mother being incapable of following court orders,[33] (k) he maintained that he had not influenced the younger child to say, on 22 june 2022, that his mother had hit him with a wooden spoon. rather, that is what the younger child had told him,[34] (l) he had sought to have the icl removed because the children had reported corporal punishment by the mother after there had been orders restraining such conduct, but the icl had failed to address the issue and was dismissive of it,[35] (m) he is not persuaded that the children have aboriginal heritage, does not support education about aboriginal culture and custom at the expense of the main curriculum, and believes that all aspects of culture should be taught rather than just that which is “glorified”. he thinks it unlikely they need to continue aboriginal studies, but would reconsider this if it is proven over time that they have aboriginal heritage,[36] (n) the father does not support the children being exposed to education about transgender issues until they are adults and considers there is inappropriate information disseminated about sex and gender to children. however, he accepts there are persons who live with genuine gender dysphoria,[37] (o) he agreed that the elder child’s attendance at school deteriorated for a time after he commenced living with him, but says it has now improved. there were also some behavioural issues which he says have been addressed and were not just related to the elder child, but also others at the school,[38] (p) he conceded he has things to learn as a parent and will be more hands-on,[39] (q) he agreed that he had told the elder child that the mother is delusional and he conceded that this was not child-focussed,[40] (r) he accepts that the younger child may have heard him discussing these proceedings with his lawyer, but this was a ‘slip’ and he usually shields the children as much as possible, (s) he confirmed that he considered court child expert to be biased, but denied that ms k and the single expert were. he also denied that he was controlling or intimidating as opined by the court child expert and stated that his behaviour in court is the same as during his interviews with her,[41] (t) as a child he had been excessively physically disciplined and he opposes any form of physical discipline,[42] (u) he believes in freedom of choice, and that children should be left to make mistakes and learn from them. he admitted having failed to set appropriate boundaries at times, including that he had trouble successfully limiting the elder child’s gaming on computers, and said that he is seeking to influence positives from the elder child’s use of and interest in computers,[43] (v) he disputed a number of the court child expert’s opinions, including that: (i) his behaviours through the court proceedings were consistent with a person who previously perpetrated family violence and had mental health issues, and (ii) he had undermined the mother’s relationship with the elder child,[44] (w) his evidence was that he was opposed to covid-19 vaccination for the children because there was insufficient evidence of them being safe for children, but that he is not generally opposed to vaccination per se. despite this he had not consulted with the children’s general practitioner dr p about vaccination of the children, except in respect of the covid-19 vaccination in the context of determining if dr p would give expert evidence in these proceedings,[45] and (x) he encourages the elder child to instigate a relationship with his mother and younger half-sister, but agrees they are currently estranged. he maintained that he has made attempts to ensure the elder child sees them, but the mother has not co-operated. he has encouraged the elder child to work at his grandmother’s house as a means of starting the process of reconnecting, but the elder child is reluctant. as at the present time, despite court orders, the elder child is not spending time with the mother.[46]   a typical day involves the elder child and him getting up at 7:30am, the elder child having opportunity for breakfast and getting ready for school. they leave home around 8:10am and he drops the elder child at school at around 8:40am. he then returns home and does work or housework as required and sometimes has a nap as he is not a great sleeper. he used to drive to town h to collect the elder child from school, but

described the mother as narcissistic, self-absorbed, ignorant and self-righteous. he agreed that he dislikes the mother,[28] (f) he had on many occasions tried to agree an amicable arrangement with the mother about the children spending time with her and a reasonable amount of time with him, but has received nothing but hostility and condescending remarks,[29] (g) the blame for not reaching an agreement is not only the mother’s, and he admits he could have remained calmer instead of being loud and insisting,[30] (h) the father gave evidence about the health-related issues for both children and his desire to be involved in decision making about them, which have been entirely dealt with by the mother satisfactorily to date,[31] (i) the father maintained he had consistently tried to have the elder child spend time with his mother, but was not successful except on very limited occasions,[32] (j) he had changed his attitude to potential consent orders after july 2022 due to the allegations that he influenced the younger child to make a false claim that the mother hit him with a wooden spoon, and also what he described as the mother being incapable of following court orders,[33] (k) he maintained that he had not influenced the younger child to say, on 22 june 2022, that his mother had hit him with a wooden spoon. rather, that is what the younger child had told him,[34] (l) he had sought to have the icl removed because the children had reported corporal punishment by the mother after there had been orders restraining such conduct, but the icl had failed to address the issue and was dismissive of it,[35] (m) he is not persuaded that the children have aboriginal heritage, does not support education about aboriginal culture and custom at the expense of the main curriculum, and believes that all aspects of culture should be taught rather than just that which is “glorified”. he thinks it unlikely they need to continue aboriginal studies, but would reconsider this if it is proven over time that they have aboriginal heritage,[36] (n) the father does not support the children being exposed to education about transgender issues until they are adults and considers there is inappropriate information disseminated about sex and gender to children. however, he accepts there are persons who live with genuine gender dysphoria,[37] (o) he agreed that the elder child’s attendance at school deteriorated for a time after he commenced living with him, but says it has now improved. there were also some behavioural issues which he says have been addressed and were not just related to the elder child, but also others at the school,[38] (p) he conceded he has things to learn as a parent and will be more hands-on,[39] (q) he agreed that he had told the elder child that the mother is delusional and he conceded that this was not child-focussed,[40] (r) he accepts that the younger child may have heard him discussing these proceedings with his lawyer, but this was a ‘slip’ and he usually shields the children as much as possible, (s) he confirmed that he considered court child expert to be biased, but denied that ms k and the single expert were. he also denied that he was controlling or intimidating as opined by the court child expert and stated that his behaviour in court is the same as during his interviews with her,[41] (t) as a child he had been excessively physically disciplined and he opposes any form of physical discipline,[42] (u) he believes in freedom of choice, and that children should be left to make mistakes and learn from them. he admitted having failed to set appropriate boundaries at times, including that he had trouble successfully limiting the elder child’s gaming on computers, and said that he is seeking to influence positives from the elder child’s use of and interest in computers,[43] (v) he disputed a number of the court child expert’s opinions, including that: (i) his behaviours through the court proceedings were consistent with a person who previously perpetrated family violence and had mental health issues, and (ii) he had undermined the mother’s relationship with the elder child,[44] (w) his evidence was that he was opposed to covid-19 vaccination for the children because there was insufficient evidence of them being safe for children, but that he is not generally opposed to vaccination per se. despite this he had not consulted with the children’s general practitioner dr p about vaccination of the children, except in respect of the covid-19 vaccination in the context of determining if dr p would give expert evidence in these proceedings,[45] and (x) he encourages the elder child to instigate a relationship with his mother and younger half-sister, but agrees they are currently estranged. he maintained that he has made attempts to ensure the elder child sees them, but the mother has not co-operated. he has encouraged the elder child to work at his grandmother’s house as a means of starting the process of reconnecting, but the elder child is reluctant. as at the present time, despite court orders, the elder child is not spending time with the mother.[46]   he persisted in obtaining information about how the elder child can get a bus home because of the cost of him making two return trips to the school each day. the investigations and enquiries took months, and he was

it sounds like a concocted story to justify a particular approach to the boys. um, i was alert to the possibility that perhaps [the elder child]’s story about being bashed and hit at the mother’s house had been suggested to him by other parties, but i could not find evidence of that. although, there was certainly a lot of hostility between [the father] and [the mother] ...so if there was, if that wooden spoon story was concocted and it was [the father] trying to seek some sort of advantage out of it and play on allegations the boys have made about physical punishment, and fortunately [the younger child] is a bit of an open book and, er, he was happy to tell the truth.
closing submissions
icl’s submissions  the mother is more attuned to what is acceptable parenting and childhood behaviour, (b) the father has denigrated the mother to the children, (c) the father has not shielded the children from the parental conflict, (d) the father fabricated the wooden spoon allegation in july 2022 in an attempt to have the younger child live with him, (e) there are a number of concerns about the father’s parenting capacity, including basic food issues, deterioration in school attendance, the elder child’s inappropriate conduct at school and development of a gaming addiction in the father’s care. it was emphasised that the elder child is not yet 14 years old, yet the father treats him as if he is older by allowing him to make choices and by his inability to have the elder child spend time with the mother, (f) the allegations of abuse in the mother’s household have been exaggerated, but she and the step-father must commit to a calm home and to not use physical discipline, (g) although significant emphasis was not placed on the children’s aboriginality, it is significant that the father was dismissive of it altogether, and (h) based on the foregoing, it is submitted by the icl that the mother should have sole parental responsibility for both children and they should live with her. this would also permit the siblings, including the younger half-sister, to all be united.

evaluation of evidence and findings
primary considerations  the mother has a derogatory view of the father and it is likely the children have appreciated this because she has not shielded them from such awareness,[73] (b) the father has called the mother delusional and similarly the children likely appreciate that his opinion of the mother is poor,[74] (c) both parents have at different times failed to comply with court orders, leading to disagreements in the presence of the children or of which the children have become aware,[75] and   the father has called the mother delusional and similarly the children likely appreciate that his opinion of the mother is poor,[74] (c) both parents have at different times failed to comply with court orders, leading to disagreements in the presence of the children or of which the children have become aware,[75] and   both parents have at different times failed to comply with court orders, leading to disagreements in the presence of the children or of which the children have become aware,[75] and   the mother’s admission that she had used physical smacking when the children were younger,[76] (b) the younger child’s innocent and frank report of his mother having a temper,[77] (c) the opinion of the court child expert that the mother’s parenting style is rigid and authoritarian,[78] (d) the children’s reports of physical discipline to the court child expert and the single expert sounded as if they had a “ring of truth” and in some instances were detailed accounts,[79] and (e) the single expert’s view that there was probably underlying credibility in the children’s accounts of this occurring in the past.[80]   the younger child’s innocent and frank report of his mother having a temper,[77] (c) the opinion of the court child expert that the mother’s parenting style is rigid and authoritarian,[78] (d) the children’s reports of physical discipline to the court child expert and the single expert sounded as if they had a “ring of truth” and in some instances were detailed accounts,[79] and (e) the single expert’s view that there was probably underlying credibility in the children’s accounts of this occurring in the past.[80]   the opinion of the court child expert that the mother’s parenting style is rigid and authoritarian,[78] (d) the children’s reports of physical discipline to the court child expert and the single expert sounded as if they had a “ring of truth” and in some instances were detailed accounts,[79] and (e) the single expert’s view that there was probably underlying credibility in the children’s accounts of this occurring in the past.[80]   the children’s reports of physical discipline to the court child expert and the single expert sounded as if they had a “ring of truth” and in some instances were detailed accounts,[79] and (e) the single expert’s view that there was probably underlying credibility in the children’s accounts of this occurring in the past.[80]   the single expert’s view that there was probably underlying credibility in the children’s accounts of this occurring in the past.[80]
all of which collectively persuade me that the mother has resorted to physical discipline at times and is likely to present a risk of physical discipline for the children into the future. the degree of this risk is hard to assess, but noting the fractured relationships and the children maturing and wanting to assert independence, it is at a level which cannot be ignored.
section 60cc(3) considerations  both parties desist from denigrating the other, restrain from discussing the proceedings and disputes about their arrangements with the children and abide by court orders, (b) the mother encourages and facilitates him to spend time with the father and speaks positively of the father, and (c) the younger child is assured by the father that he will return to the mother’s care after spending time with him, which can be achieved by mandatory injunction.   the mother encourages and facilitates him to spend time with the father and speaks positively of the father, and (c) the younger child is assured by the father that he will return to the mother’s care after spending time with him, which can be achieved by mandatory injunction.   the younger child is assured by the father that he will return to the mother’s care after spending time with him, which can be achieved by mandatory injunction.
well, if we then test the possible solution of a circuit breaker and moving [the elder child] into the care of [the mother] and [the step-father], the impression i have from the events since the middle of – or when these proceedings first came before me is that [the elder child], as a fairly strong-willed, now nearly 14 year old, is going to push back, potentially rebel, and if that’s occurring in [the mother]’s household, isn’t it important for me to also give consideration of the impact of that on [the younger child]? yes. and the [half-sister], the [younger half-sister]. so it is a really delicate balancing exercise of managing those risks and it seems to me that it’s not straightforward. what’s your comment about that? look, i definitely agree and, like i said, the risk to [the elder child] is different to the risk to [x] and to – i think it’s [younger half-sister], isn’t it? because it seems likely that [the elder child] may at times become physical. he certainly, you know, accused [the mother] and [the step-father] of being physical with him. he’s large enough to become physical. so that is a challenge that they would need to be managing. in saying that, yes, he was previously quite a compliant child and, again, some of it would be depending on [the father] in terms of not picking him up or actively, you know, letting him know that he can return home, like making it very clear that that’s – well, to his home, because if he isn’t able to do that then, you know, it’s going to be really challenging for [the elder child] to – if he’s getting mixed messages, he has been getting mixed messages now for some time. [the elder child] loves [younger half-sister] and [the younger child], and he was observed to be very kind to them, but that was a very short observation and is different from if you have a nearly 14-year-old in a – you know, who’s at home, bored, wanting to go on gaming and, you know – and i think that they’re going to need a lot of support. if i were – i would suggest that [the mother] and [the step-father] would probably benefit from one of the intensive intervention programs, like an [ifs] program, if that did happen. so it is complex. the interplay of risk is complex, because what the risks are to [the elder child] isn’t necessarily the risks for [the younger child] and isn’t necessarily the risks to [the mother] and [the step-father] or to [younger half-sister], and the risks will change as the situation evolves. so, i mean, having a professional in there to do safety planning as things happen would probably be really useful, but i don’t think a family therapist is necessarily appropriate for that, but someone who – like an integrated family support worker who manages risks for child protection would be probably useful in relation to that. so, yes, i can’t say that [the younger child] wouldn’t be negatively – or [younger half-sister] wouldn’t be negatively affected to quite a substantial agree, but the hope would be that [the mother] and [the step-father] would access support to protect them.
