the icl’s case
the court child expert’s evidence  she believes that the child was honest with her about his reasons for not spending time with the father, which she reported in the family report at [73]. in her opinion, it is likely that the father has told the child about his criminal history and may have been well-meaning in doing so, (b) in relation to the child’s report of the toilet incident as she reported in the family report at [75], her impression was that the child was genuinely frightened, (c) the child is “on the lookout” for illegal behaviour at his father’s home, which is reinforced by the opinions of the step-father. his queries regarding plants in the father’s garden is an example of this,[7] (d) the current spend time arrangements are unlikely to improve the child’s relationship with the father. the benefit of maintaining it is that it allows the child to spend time with other paternal relatives, and (e) permitting the child to relocate to south australia will not make the relationship between the father and the child worse, given its current state.   in relation to the child’s report of the toilet incident as she reported in the family report at [75], her impression

...it is usual for a concerned parent to focus on and perhaps encourage children to report negative information about their other parent and this could be part of what is occurring for [the child].   there is no evidence that the father has directly threatened the mother or the step-father since 2011, and (b) there is no evidence that the father has carried through with threats that have been allegedly made to the child, despite his demonstrated frustrations that the mother has repeatedly breached the orders of this court.   there is no evidence that the father has carried through with threats that have been allegedly made to the child, despite his demonstrated frustrations that the mother has repeatedly breached the orders of this court.   the mother has been non-compliant with previous orders on many occasions without reasonable excuse, (b) the child has been the subject of court proceedings for the majority of his life, with child protection proceedings in the magistrate court commencing just prior to his second birthday for his removal from the care of the mother, and (c) proceedings have continued in this jurisdiction between 2017 and the present.   the child has been the subject of court proceedings for the majority of his life, with child protection proceedings in the magistrate court commencing just prior to his second birthday for his removal from the care of the mother, and (c) proceedings have continued in this jurisdiction between 2017 and the present.   proceedings have continued in this jurisdiction between 2017 and the present.
key disputed facts and considerations  the mother’s account of reporting the incident to police soon after it occurred in september 2019 is not corroborated by the information taken by police and recorded in the disclosure report tendered in evidence,[31] (b) the step-father’s account to the court child expert that “police were right onto it”[32] is plainly not the case, (c) it is unlikely that the father, given his relative size to the child, could “lift him up by the legs”[33] or “dangle”[34] his head over the toilet bowl as the child reported on different occasions, (d) the child did not disclose this to the police when his mother presented him allegedly for that purpose and he gave other reasons for not wanting to spend time with his father,[35] (e) the child apparently did not report the incident to mr j when he had his first visit, and he instead gave other reasons for not wishing to spend time with his father.[36] a report of the nature alleged if made by the child would need to be subject of mandatory notification by mr j to child safety services. there does not appear to be such a notification and instead the inference from that which is reported on 5 december 2019 is that the mother made a report about this alleged incident,[37] (f) the child only reported the incident to mr j when his mother was present on a subsequent visit, and (g) the father’s alleged

...it seems possible that [the father’s] talk and/or actions of threatening to flush [the child]’s head in the toilet bowl were experienced by the child as threatening. while it is difficult to believe a parent would act in this way, [the father’s] police record notes many instances of behaviour that falls well outside typical social norms. [the father’s] tendency towards volatility may have ameliorated as he has aged or due to other factors, as asserted by him. however, his inflexible thinking style and firm beliefs may compromise his ability to appear calm when he feels challenged.   he has been influenced to inaccurately report or exaggerate what did happen and was said, (b) he may also be impacted by witnessing family violence between the parents, but also between his mother and other partners. all which likely lead to hypervigilance on his part, and (c) the child may be worried or afraid of facing his father and his potential reaction to his reporting of the incident. this is informed by the court child expert’s view at [92] of the family report.   he may also be impacted by witnessing family violence between the parents, but also between his mother and other partners. all which likely lead to hypervigilance on his part, and (c) the child may be worried or afraid of facing his father and his potential reaction to his reporting of the incident. this is informed by the court child expert’s view at [92] of the family report.   the child may be worried or afraid of facing his father and his potential reaction to his reporting of the incident. this is informed by the court child expert’s view at [92] of the family report.   his answers to questions in cross-examination demonstrated simplistic formulations of concepts of child-focussed care and bonding with the child. he lacked the ability to elaborate on what this should involve, (b) his admission that his choice of words could be threatening, and (c) his tendency to speak loudly due to a hearing impairment that may portray anger when it is not intended,   his admission that his choice of words could be threatening, and (c) his tendency to speak loudly due to a hearing impairment that may portray anger when it is not intended,   his tendency to speak loudly due to a hearing impairment that may portray anger when it is not intended,
all of which are consistent with the views of the court child expert about the father’s thinking and personality.[39]
.....[the father] presents as having poor ability to shield [the child] from his negativity about [the mother] and [the step-father] ongoing. [the father’s] concrete thinking style and poor reflective capacity will hinder his ability to engage in therapeutic or other interventions to assist in his understanding about how he might behave differently to increase [the child]’s feelings of security in his care.

in our view, it is clear that, while the impact of any parent’s relevant actions should, if the evidence permits, be identified, the references to “fulfilled, or failed to fulfil responsibilities as a parent” and “...facilitated, or failed to facilitate” demonstrate that the actions of each parent in the relevant respects are to be evaluated for something beyond consequence alone, namely what those actions say of the person’s capacity to parent.
benefits and detriments of the proposals .] as everyone knows we were moving to brisbane then coved kept us here after that we had court case with [the child]’s fake dad.. any way we been unsure if our future well after my long stint last week iv done a lot of thinking [the child] is now back in a boxing jym he loves & both boys love there school & doing well sooo [the mother] and i both going hard for full time jobs it’s only way we can afford to stay in this very expensive state. sum it up if we can both get work we staying in tas [sic]   it is not based on objective and realistic daily experience, and (b) is expressed of by a child described as relatively immaturity for his age, and (c) it has been influenced inappropriately.[49]   is expressed of by a child described as relatively immaturity for his age, and (c) it has been influenced inappropriately.[49]   it has been influenced inappropriately.[49]
