reasons for judgment
judge turnbull
overview and brief chronology
the parties’ positions and evidence
for the mother:
results: [ms ralston]'s responses to this measure are consistent with the extensive use of denial, repression and avoidance of unpleasant emotional states. therapeutic intervention is indicated to assist [ms ralston] with experiencing and managing difficult emotions, and being more assertive in conflict resolution rather than avoidant. her profile is consistent with having an extraordinarily difficult time dealing directly with any behavioural expressions or thoughts of being angry, meaning that she is likely preoccupied with control. her responses suggest that anger is very socially unacceptable to her, and produces immediate pressure on her to avoid it. overcontrol of anger may also relate to overcontrol of other emotions, and can be associated with debilitating anxiety and depression.[25]   expressed that he would like to continue in the regime of nine nights with his mother, and five nights with his father each fortnight (5/9). he also expressed his wish to remain at [b school] with his friends until the end of grade 6. [x] expressed age-appropriate views of becoming a big brother, and advised that his little brother can be annoying at times. he expressed that it was good that his bedroom at his father’s home had been moved further away from his little brother, so that he could get better sleep and not be disturbed. he described that sometimes he helps with the baby, such as holding his bottle when they are in the back seat of the car together. [x] advised that he felt included, and knows that his dad loves him and the new baby. [x] advised feeling very happy at his school at [suburb b], with good friends and activities that he enjoys. he advised that he will go to high school with some of his friends. i discussed [x]’s wishes for 5/9 time to continue with his parents. [mr reese] was seeking increased time to 7/7. [ms ralston] [the mother] was seeking a reduction of [x]’s time with his father. both parents expressed that they were willing to support [x]’s wishes of 5/9 time, even if it was not consistent with their own wishes for more time with him. [x]’s parents did not reach agreement regarding which school he attends during the course of the assessment.[26]
parenting orders: the law
x’s schooling arrangements
... the process of evaluation should not entail an assessment of the relative merits of the schools preferred by the parties, at least in circumstances where the competing schools are prima facie satisfactory (re g at [91]–[92]). ordinarily, it will be in the child’s best interests to attend a school close to his or her residence, and further, it is proper to consider evidence as to any greater effect of the decision upon the resident rather than non-resident parent (re g at [92]–[93]), but that does not mean the convenience of the non-resident parent is ignored (eden-proust at [56]–[63]). while the views of the child are relevant to the inquiry, as s.60cc(3)(a) of the act now stipulates, those views are usually not determinative. that is because, unless a child is actively unhappy in a particular school environment, it is not at all unusual for the child to express a desire to remain at his or her existing school (see re g at [96]). there is conflict in the authorities about whether any prior agreement between the parties concerning the child’s schooling is influential (see re g at [92], eden-proust at [48]). there also seems a difference of opinion about the need to refer specifically to each of the factors enumerated in s.60cc or whether it is permissible to simply analyse the evidence discursively with those factors in mind (see re g at [67]–[90], eden-proust at [69]).[34]
unacceptable risk
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[39]
standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
x’s best interests
the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the children’s parents (s.60cc(2)(a))
what these definitions convey is that "meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[43]
it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[44]
both parents describe that they have a close relationship with x, and each provided examples of the quality time and interests they share together.[47]
x also told dr k that ‘he felt included, and knows that his dad loves him and the new baby’.[48]
the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence (s.60cc(2)(b))
and following separation that he:   ralston] has presented an extensive account of her perception of [mr reese]'s coercive and controlling family violence behaviour. [mr reese] acknowledges past incidents of arguments during which he has said things he regrets, and occasions on which he consumed too much alcohol. when all of the information is considered, it is my view that [ms ralston]'s anxiety regarding [x] leaving her care to spend time with [mr reese] has heightened her perception of threat, and influenced the severity of her perceptions of family violence. [mr reese] does not present with a forensic profile of a severe family violence offender. this does not mean that family violence has not occurred, or that his past behaviour in certain situations has been acceptable. however, it does impact on whether he should have the opportunity to parent [x], and it is only in extreme cases of family violence that children are denied contact with their parent. he has not yet been given the opportunity post-separation to share the care of [x] in a meaningful way, and to demonstrate that he is able to function well in this role.[68] adding: it must be remembered that [x] has not been observed to exhibit trauma or anxiety symptoms in the presence of his father, and that he has actually enjoyed their time together. it is important for his development that he has the freedom to enjoy his relationship with his father without impediment.[69]   ralston] acknowledges that she experiences significant anxiety, as outlined in my initial report. she is hypervigilant in her protection of [x]. she has contacted the police to check on [x]’s welfare when in the care of [mr reese]. her concerns have not been substantiated by authorities, and [x] has been found to be safe and well.[70]
this report is deliberately succinct, as details in my last report were weaponised in this dispute, particularly in relation to [ms ralston]'s mental health. this is not helpful, and contributes to the further deterioration of a fragile working relationship between these parents. each of the parents now has an opportunity to start a new life with their new partner, and hopefully these pathways can bring more contentment for them than their shared past together. [x] will benefit from having two healthy families supporting his growth and wellbeing.[71]
180. before turning to the wife’s evidence in this respect, it is desirable to say something about the corroboration of family violence. it is well settled that a party does not require their evidence of family violence to be corroborated before such evidence can be accepted. given the tendency of domestic violence to occur in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage and perhaps their children, this must necessarily be so: see keating & keating [2019] famcafc 46, (2019) flc 93-894 at [42] (ainslie-wallace and ryan jj) (“keating”), hendy & penningh [2018] famcafc 257, (2018) flc 93-879 at [72] (ainslie-wallace, ryan & austin jj), amador & amador [2009] famcafc 196, (2009) 43 fam lr 268 at [79] (may, coleman & le poer trench jj) (“amador”). 181. whilst as a general principle it is important to identify a core consistency in the evidence of an alleged victim of family violence rather than concentrating on supposed inconsistencies in the evidence, this does not permit a court to ignore or otherwise dismiss inconsistencies in that evidence: keating at [62] (austin j), zuen & lhao [2020] famcafc 84 at [22]- [24] (ryan, aldridge and stevenson jj) (“zuen & lhao”). however the reference to the importance of identifying a core consistency, while important in cases involving family violence, must not obscure the reality that there cannot be a finding of family violence otherwise than in accordance with s 140 of the evidence act and having regard to all relevant matters: see amador at [86]-[93]. where allegations of family violence are made it is necessary for the court to make findings where the evidence enables that to be done: see zuen & lhao at [24].
in any event, it must be said that the rule in browne v dunn does not apply where the witness is on notice that the witness's version of events is in contest. that notice may come from the pleadings or the other side's evidence or the other side's opening, it may even come from the general manner in which the case is conducted. in general, however, this exception to the rule should only operate where the issue is a fairly clear and obvious one (see seymour v australian broadcasting commission 19 nsw lr 219 at 224-5 per glass ja, trade practices commission v mobil oil australia ltd [1984] fca 238, (1984) 3 fcr 168 at 181, jagelman v fct (1994) 31 atr 467 at 472-3, and raben footwear pty ltd v polygram records inc [1997] fca 370, 145 alr 1 at 15).
with respect to his relationship with [ms ralston], he described that they were a very social couple, and that their lifestyle had to change when [x] was born. he described that they both struggled with the adjustment, and made financial mistakes that put them under stress. he stated "[x] was not planned...! was in shock...we didn't have a stable financial situation...! was reluctant to bring a child into that...but we both wanted a child." [mr reese] explained that [ms ralston] had a diagnosis of endometriosis and that getting pregnant could be difficult. [mr reese] acknowledged that he "did the wrong thing" when [ms ralston] was pregnant, and went out drinking on a couple of occasions. he described that [ms ralston] took good care of herself during the pregnancy. there were some complications when [x] was in utero, and he was born via c-section. he described the joy of watching [x] being born, and holding him for the first time. [mr reese] acknowledged that when [x] came home, things were difficult. [x] was not a good sleeper, and [mr reese] was diagnosed with a virus that made him very tired. in the first year the couple tried to juggle work responsibilities in running their own business and raising [x]. they were reportedly exhausted, and this period took its toll on their relationship.[76]
unfortunately, the father's poor behaviour at that time is likely to have contributed to the mother's anxiety and her negative view of him.
we went into the [store v] in [suburb w] and [x]wanted to buy a baseball bat to take to the park. we went to the isle where the baseball bats were (toy foam ones) and [mr reese] picked up a pretend bat and started making actions like he was going to hit me in the head with it. he didn’t actually hit me and i didn’t think he was going to hit me (as it was foam and wouldn’t have hurt) but the look in his eyes was that he wished for it to be a normal bat and he would have wanted to hit me. i asked him to stop and it was embarrassing and there was a couple nearby who were looking and thinking it was strange. i felt embarrassed and that it wasn’t a normal thing someone does to another person. he stopped and we left the store purchasing a few items.[80]
her statements are contradictory and i prefer the explanation of the father. it is difficult to accept that the mothers reaction was reasonable in reporting this matter to police and obtaining a pfvo in the circumstances, but may be explained as a product of her heightened anxiety as opined by dr k.
on 24 march 2019 i walked in on [mr reese] and [x] in the bedroom. i saw [mr reese]'s entire body on top of [x] on our bed. i could only see [x]’s arm poking out from under [mr reese] torso waving around. i appeared that [x] was squashed under the weight of [mr reese]'s body. i screamed “what are you doing” to [mr reese] and i pulled him off [x]. i picked him up in my arms and he was having trouble breathing. he was red in the face. once [x] was able to catch his breath he started sobbing hysterically and he was inconsolable for a period. [mr reese] screamed at me saying i was overreaction and overbearing. he did not ask if [x] was okay or show concern for [x]’s fear and distress.[81]   and i were playing pillow fights on our own bed, like we often did. [x] was laughing and throwing pillows at me and me gently throwing them back. [x] jumped on my back and playfully fell on the mattress as [ms ralston] walked past the door. [x] was not in any state other than playing and exhausted from laughter from tackling me to the ground. there was no screaming and [ms ralston] did not pull me off [x] or even console [x], we just stopped playing.[82]
any views expressed by the child, and the weight to be accorded to those views given their age and level of maturity (s.60cc(3)(a))
the terms of s.60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child’s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child’s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child’s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court to these matters.[84]
there continue[s] to be significant problems with [ms ralston] and [mr reese]'s capacity to engage appropriately with each other. however, they are both presenting with litigation fatigue, and advised that they are willing to support [x]’s expressed wishes with respect to division of time. there may be an opportunity here for a new beginning. i discussed [x]’s wishes for 5/9 time to continue with his parents. [mr reese] was seeking increased time to 7/7. [ms ralston] was seeking a reduction of [x]’s time with his father. both parent expressed that they are willing to support [x]’s wishes of 5/9 time, even if it was not consistent with their own wishes for more time with him.[85]
the nature of the relationship of the child with each of their parents and any other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) (s.60cc(3)(b))
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child (s.60cc(3)(c))
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child (s.60cc(3)(ca))
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect to the children from any separation from either of their parents or any other child with whom they have been living (s.60cc(3)(d))
the practical difficulty and expense of the child spending time with and communicating with a parent, and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis (s.60cc(3)(e))  spend three hours each day in the car travelling. this is unsustainable because of the enormous cost of fuel and the use of the car, and also on me personally as i try to manage my full-time workload. i pay child support to [ms ralston] from the income which i earn. i have to work most evenings in order to make up for the time lost during the day and this diminishes the time that i can spend with [x], my son [s] and my partner. my employers have cooperated with this arrangement because they understand it to be temporary but it is not sustainable in the long-term.[99]
it’s what’s convenient for the family, [ms ralston] has had convenience for two years.
where, as in the present case, the paramount consideration is the child's best interests, it is not always appropriate that the issues be explored and the evidence revealed strictly in accordance with the adversarial procedures that apply in party-party litigation. that being so, it is noteworthy that in this case there was no consideration of the possibility that the father could return to india permanently to avail himself of frequent and regular contact with his daughter. the failure to explore that possibility, particularly given the father's origins, his professional qualifications and family contacts in india, seems to me to be explicable only on the basis of an assumption, inherently sexist, that a father's choice as to where he lives is beyond challenge in a way that a mother's is not.
ultimately, convenience of x’s living arrangements to either party is subservient to the arrangements that are in his best interests.   is well settled at school and has and good friendship group from the local area. [x] continues to receive continuous accolades from his teachers on how he well is going at school, his base assessment and sporting activities. he is adored by the [suburb b] community and knows every child in his school last year, he was awarded the [b school] citizen of the year award for role model behaviours at school. annexed hereto and marked "f" is a copy of the base assessment for this year. by attending [b school] my parents can care for [x] afterschool when i am not available. this means that [x] does not have to attend afterschool care. [mr reese] and i had previously agreed for [x] to attend a public primary school namely [b school]. [mr reese] and i had previously agreed at mediation to send [x] to [h school] for high school. after [mr reese] proposed [l school] i visited the school and spoke at length to the principal about the school. it is a lovely school, however when compared to b school i do not feel that this school offers "better" conditions for [x]. what it offers is very similar to [b school] with the exception of the following: a. [l school] does not offer monthly bush and beach classes, b. [l school] does not offer palawa kani lessons to its students, c. [l school] does not have an extensive sensory and water play area, [l school] has more than double the number of students to the same number of teachers.[105]
i propose that at the end of this year [x] transfer to [l school] . this is a highly-regarded inner-city school which produces 97/100 in academic results. the school is five minutes travel from my residence, five minutes travel from my work and nine minutes travel from [ms ralston]'s work. my family are able to support after-school care. my son, [s], will attend [l school] . [x] and [s] will be accepted automatically at [l school] because we are in the assigned catchment area for that school. the impact for [x] on change of school will be minimal. [ms ralston] has never had any concerns about the impact on [x] of changing school - she has strongly lobbied for him to transfer to [h school]. [x] has current friends that attend [l school] including the children of some of our family friends. he will be able to maintain existing [suburb b] friendships through his involvement in his [sports] club and play dates when he is with his mother. [l school] has, from my enquiries, an excellent reputation and very strong values. it is a bigger school than [b school] and this enables the school to offer much more to its students such as participation in national events in maths, leadership and athletics, all of which [x] enjoys. after grade 6 [x] will be able to move on to a local high school with his friends. if he remains at [suburb b] there is no nearby high school. it is [x]'s nature that he is not likely to find a change of school difficult. he is confident and successful academically and he is very social, easily making new friends.[106]   expressed that he would like to continue in the regime of nine nights with his mother, and five nights with his father each fortnight (5/9). he also expressed his wish to remain at [b school] with his friends until the end of grade 6. [x] advised feeling very happy at his school at [suburb b], with good friends and activities that he enjoys. he advised that he will go to high school with some of his friends.[108]
the capacity of each of the child’s parents to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs (s.60cc(3)(f))
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background of the child and each of the child’s parents (s.60cc(3)(g))
if the child is aboriginal or torres strait islander (s.60cc(3)(h))
the attitude to the child and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the parents (s.60cc(3)(i))  ralston] acknowledges that she experiences significant anxiety, as outlined in my initial report. she is hypervigilant in her protection of [x]. she has contacted the police to check on [x]'s welfare when in the care of [mr reese]. her concerns have not been substantiated by authorities, and [x] has been found to be safe and well.[113]   ralston] is co-sleeping with [x] and not encouraging his relationship with his father. her anxiety regarding contact between them will be impacting on [x], as he is old enough to perceive this and internalise that anxiety himself[117]
any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family (s.60cc(3)(j))
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter (s.60cc(3)(k))
that [mr reese] must: not stalk [ms ralston]. not directly or indirectly threaten, harass, abuse or assault [ms ralston]. not enter premises at [af street, suburb b] where [ms ralston] is presently living or any other place where the said persons may be staying from time to time. not go within 100 metres of the boundary of the premises at [af street, suburb b] or the boundary of any premises where the said [ms ralston] may be staying or living from time to time immediately surrender any firearms and ammunition, any other weapons, and any firearms licence in his/her possession or control to a police officer, and if required accompany a police officer for the purpose of surrendering those firearms or weapons. 13. not apply for any licence or permit under the firearms act 1996. forfeit and immediately surrender any licence or permit held pursuant to the firearms act 1996 and in the possession of [mr reese] to a police station or police officer. during the period of the order, [mr reese] must not possess any firearm, part of a firearm or ammunition.
i was in two minds about whether or not i should allow him to see [x] but i also did not want him to get back behind the wheel and drive back to [city a] intoxicated. that afternoon [mr reese] asked if he could stay the night and we could talk through what he was doing to change and to fix what he had done. i agreed. we reconciled. the next day we went to the [store v] in [suburb w] to buy [x] a toy baseball bat. when we found the bat i the store [mr reese] demonstrated to [x] how to use the bat by pretending to beat me in head with it. this incident made me feel traumatised, scared and humiliated. i suggested we leave and went and paid for the bat not wanting to draw [x]'s attention any further to what had happened. on the way home [x] asked if we could stop at the [suburb o] playground. when i was pushing [x] on the swing [mr reese] took the baseball bat and pretended to hit [x] in the face every time he swung towards [mr reese]. again, this made me feel fearful. i thought [mr reese] was looking at [x] like he wanted to kill him. i was horrified and i yelled at him to stop. that night i was too terrified to say anything to [mr reese] and i was very scared that he was going to hurt us. in the morning when he left i packed a bag and went to my parents home and decided to report the incident to police. these incidents were the basis of a police family violence order being issued by tasmania police.[121]
whether it would be preferable to make orders that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child (s.60cc(3)(l))
any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant (s.60cc(3)(m))
shared parental responsibility
equal time or substantial and significant time?  how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[127]   the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[127]   the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[127]   the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[127]   such other matters as the court considers relevant.[127]
equal time
substantial and significant time  for the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend substantial and significant time with a parent only if: (a) the time the child spends with the parent includes both: (i) days that fall on weekends and holidays, and (ii) days that do not fall on weekends or holidays, and (b) the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in: (i) the child's daily routine, and (ii) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child, and (c) the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent. (4) subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.   the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.
conclusion
each of the parents now has an opportunity to start a new life with their new partner, and hopefully these pathways can bring more contentment for them than their shared past together. x will benefit from having two healthy families supporting his growth and wellbeing.[128]

[8]tree j referred to order 6 not 4 in his order by mistake — judge dunkley ordered that: (2) x shall spend time with his father, in addition to the time provided for in the orders made on 18 march 2021, as follows: (a) [d]uring school term time, from after school on friday until beginning of school on wednesday in each alternate week commencing the first friday of each school term; and (4) unless the parents otherwise agree, x shall continue to attend suburb bb school for the duration of his primary school education.

[122] fla (n 27) s 61b.[123] ibid s 61c.[124] goode & goode [2006] famca 1346, [39], at which the full court clarifies the difference between pre-separation parental responsibility and post-separation parental responsibility as it results from an order: ‘we therefore consider it clear that there is a difference between parental responsibility which exists as a result of s 61c and an order for shared parental responsibility, which has the effect set out in s 65dac. in the former, the parties may still be together or may be separated. there will be no court order in effect and the parties will exercise the responsibility either independently or jointly. once the court has made an order allocating parental responsibility between two or more people, including an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the major decisions for the long-term care and welfare of children must be made jointly, unless the court otherwise provides’.[125] fla (n 27) 65dac, noting that s 65dac appears to rely upon parties reaching joint decisions through genuine effort, and that the words of that section do not appear to account for a situation in which a genuine effort has been made pursuant to sub-s (3) but no joint decision has been reached as required by sub-s (2).[126] ibid s 61da.[127] fla (n27) s65daa(5).
