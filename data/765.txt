the wife’s case
legal principles
spouse maintenance
in ms & ps [2006] famca 588, (2006) flc 93-268, at 80,551, coleman j explained that whether an order for spousal maintenance should be made requires a four step process as follows: can the applicant support himself or herself adequately? if not, what are the applicant’s reasonable needs? what capacity does the respondent have to meet those needs? what order is reasonable having regard to s 75(2)?
child support
in my opinion, as a necessary consequence of the amendments and the decisions to which i have referred, while the lodgement of an application to the court for an order under division 4 is not a condition precedent to the hearing and determination of an application under ss. 123 and 124 of the child support act, unless there is such an application for a departure order before the court when it hears an application under sections 123 and 124 of the child support (assessment) act 1989, the court, in providing child support for the child otherwise than in the form of periodic payments, if what is proposed is a lump sum, is limited at the very most to the aggregate amount of any current assessment but most probably in the light of the authorities to the capitalisation of the current assessment for the relevant period. in my opinion it is not competent, having regard to the amendments which i have stated and their intention as revealed in the explanatory memorandum i have set out, for the court on an application under sections 123 and 124 to do other than what i have stated.
the parties’ expenses and findings  the claim that the husband is now paying $481 per week in child support. while this corresponds with the notice of assessment from the child support agency,[7] the record of payments received by the mother discloses that the father was still paying $340 per week until 30 november 2022, and (b) the claim that the husband is now paying weekly tax approaching three times what he had been paying according to his financial statement. this is explained by the husband’s yet untested evidence in his affidavit filed 1 december 2022 at [31] to [34].   the claim that the husband is now paying weekly tax approaching three times what he had been paying according to his financial statement. this is explained by the husband’s yet untested evidence in his affidavit filed 1 december 2022 at [31] to [34].
the parties’ income and findings  the husband says that if there is patient demand he works more than 75 hours a month and he worked 118 hours in june 2022 and 135 hours in july 2022, but no more than 75.5 in subsequent months,[12] (b) he is likely to do and be paid for non-clinical work on days he does spent time with the children. i make this inference from a comparison of the wife’s evidence in her affidavit filed 14 june 2022 at [9] and the spread of hours shown in the “claims detail report” which forms part of annexure 2, (c) the records in annexure 2 show he is paid for 16 hours of clinical work per month, and (d) while the husband is available to do clinical work for 14 out of 28 days in any month, according to the claims detail report he has only worked nine of those days for august to october 2022. this is a material difference to the months of june and july 2022.   he is likely to do and be paid for non-clinical work on days he does spent time with the children. i make this inference from a comparison of the wife’s evidence in her affidavit filed 14 june 2022 at [9] and the spread of hours shown in the “claims detail report” which forms part of annexure 2, (c) the records in annexure 2 show he is paid for 16 hours of clinical work per month, and (d) while the husband is available to do clinical work for 14 out of 28 days in any month, according to the claims detail report he has only worked nine of those days for august to october 2022. this is a material difference to the months of june and july 2022.   the records in annexure 2 show he is paid for 16 hours of clinical work per month, and (d) while the husband is available to do clinical work for 14 out of 28 days in any month, according to the claims detail report he has only worked nine of those days for august to october 2022. this is a material difference to the months of june and july 2022.   while the husband is available to do clinical work for 14 out of 28 days in any month, according to the claims detail report he has only worked nine of those days for august to october 2022. this is a material difference to the months of june and july 2022.
determination
a) a departure application to the court under division 4 of part 7 of the assessment act (“departure application”) is not a condition precedent to the hearing and determination of an application under s 124 of the assessment act in division 5 of part 7 of the assessment act, but b) the long standing view of division 5 of part 7 is that it serves as a means of providing a lump sum consolidation of existing obligations, not an avenue for increasing the quantum of child support payable, c) if there is a departure application before the court, when it decides the application under section 124 of the assessment act when it makes a lump sum or non-periodic order for child support, it is limited to an order up to the aggregate amount of periodic child support under the administrative assessment, d) where the court hears and decides on application pursuant to also s 124 of the assessment act for lump sum or non-periodic child support, the value of the lump sum or non-periodic child support should be expressed under s 125 of the assessment act to be credited to reduce the assessed liability under the administrative assessment, except in special circumstances, and e) for the purpose s 125, special circumstances is not confined to the meaning of that term within division 4 of part 7 of the assessment act and includes, “facts peculiar to the particular case which set it apart from other cases”.[17]

c) if there is a departure application before the court, when it decides the application under section 124 of the assessment act when it makes a lump sum or non-periodic order for child support, it is limited to an order up to the aggregate amount of periodic child support under the administrative assessment, d) where the court hears and decides on application pursuant to also s 124 of the assessment act for lump sum or non-periodic child support, the value of the lump sum or non-periodic child support should be expressed under s 125 of the assessment act to be credited to reduce the assessed liability under the administrative assessment, except in special circumstances, and e) for the purpose s 125, special circumstances is not confined to the meaning of that term within division 4 of part 7 of the assessment act and includes, “facts peculiar to the particular case which set it apart from other cases”.[17]
d) where the court hears and decides on application pursuant to also s 124 of the assessment act for lump sum or non-periodic child support, the value of the lump sum or non-periodic child support should be expressed under s 125 of the assessment act to be credited to reduce the assessed liability under the administrative assessment, except in special circumstances, and e) for the purpose s 125, special circumstances is not confined to the meaning of that term within division 4 of part 7 of the assessment act and includes, “facts peculiar to the particular case which set it apart from other cases”.[17]
