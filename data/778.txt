legal principles
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).   identify the assets, liabilities and financial resources of the parties to the marriage, (b) identify and assess the relevant contributions of each of the parties within the meaning of s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c), (c) consider the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   identify and assess the relevant contributions of each of the parties within the meaning of s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c), (c) consider the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   consider the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.

“...the court may have to determine, as between the parties, the existence of a particular liability” “the assessment of debts and liabilities is not necessarily arrived at by a strictly mathematical or accountancy approach in all cases...the court can make an allowance for a particular liability if appropriate to do so. in some cases there are sufficient uncertainties as to the alleged liability to lead the court to disregard it entirely or partly (e.g. a loan from a parent of the party not likely to be enforced, af petersens [44] ..., quirk (1983) unreported).” “...the court cannot ignore the fact that there is or may be a liability, the effect is simply that it does not consider that the other spouse should be called upon to in effect “contribute” to the liability by having that spouse’s fair share in the parties’ property reduced by virtue of its existence. the effect may be that the party who has incurred the liability will be left to meet it out of whatever funds remain to that party after satisfying the property order made under sec. 79 (af petersens (supra)).”
