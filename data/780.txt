husband’s redraw from mortgage account to purchase a business machine

october 2021, a reduction of $23,274.15 which approximates the husband’s figure. the wife used the credit available to be withdrawn on this mortgage to pay the repayments on account #...14 between

wife’s inheritance
in 2019 the wife’s grandmother passed away. the wife received jewellery and approximately $195,000 in mid-2021 from her grandmother’s estate.
56. in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. 57. if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. 58. if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post-separation income or acquisitions.
the wife has kept the jewellery. the jewellery is also a post-separation acquired asset, inherited and unconnected to the husband. there are sufficient other assets available to satisfy the husband’s property entitlement without the jewellery being included in the asset pool. in this matter there are no “very unusual circumstances”[18] to suggest that the husband has contributed significantly to the wife inheriting the jewellery. the jewellery was inherited by the wife solely because of the relationship between her and her grandmother. the jewellery will not be included in the asset pool.
should property orders be made
contributions
initial contributions
there is no evidence to support that the contributions asserted by her went anywhere other than for the benefit of the parties. it is disingenuous in my view to suggest otherwise. the husband and the business were not in a good financial position at the beginning of the relationship, he could not afford to pay rent. he was living at his mother’s home until the wife obtained rental accommodation for them. the wife asserts that she alone paid the rent for about 18 months. i am satisfied that they relied on the wife’s assets and income including toward the purchase of their first home being the property at s street, suburb t and that it was her $60,000.00 that was provided by her to mr p.
contributions during the relationship
“we accept, over time, as good couples tend to do working together as a team, they combined their talents and [c company] flourished. the business went from renting a smaller premises in 2004, making equipment purchases, employing greater number of staff to bigger premises in 2009 and getting to a point where it is today”.[23]
the wife agrees that the husband undertook works on suburb e but disputes that he did significant works. in any event, whilst the husband was working on suburb e the wife was caring for mr h and the husband’s other three children and maintained the businesses to free up the husband’s time to undertake the works.
a contribution by a parent of a party to a marriage to the property of the marriage will be taken to be a contribution made by or on behalf of the party who was the child of the parent unless there is evidence which establishes it was not the intention of the parent to benefit only his or her child.
post-separation contributions
evaluation of contributions
the court does not adopt a precise, mathematical approach to the exercise of discretion as the various matters taken into account under s 79 are not all capable of precise calculations. some considerations involve value judgments or are matters of impression. (citations omitted)
relevant factors pursuant to sections 79(4)(d)–(g) and 75(2)
the age and state of health of each of the parties
the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment
just because there is money in the business account doesn’t mean it’s mine to take....that is not how i run my business...i’ve also got eight staff to pay. i’ve got tax to pay. i’ve got payables to pay. i’m not in the mode of raping and pillaging my business for my own personal benefit.[33]
to suggest there have been rivers of cash is not borne out by the asset pool the parties have. conversely, the fact that the business has always offered a surviving income that my client and the wife were able to survive on, and lead a modest lifestyle and meet their costs of living. i think the wife attends to the fact also they took holidays – that’s the reality of the situation.[34]
commitments of each of the parties that are necessary to enable the parties to support himself or herself or a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain and the responsibilities of either party to support any other person
where the parties have separated or divorced, a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable
the duration of the marriage and the extent to which it has affected the earning capacity of the parties
if either party is cohabiting with another person and the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation
any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account
