the issues
the child impact report
the law
justice boland’s decision is not a “guideline” in the sense that it sets a benchmark for determination of similar cases. further, it is apparent from the multitude of decisions of judges in interim hearings confirmed on appeal that the principal issue in relocation cases is not whether the case is “an emergency.” the determination of issues regarding children whether on an interim basis or at a final hearing is by reference to the best interests’ principle.  0] ... apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
primary considerations
meaningful relationship  8] ...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...
seemed to present each parent in a balanced and considered manner and it would appear that she currently has meaningful relationships with them each.[1]
y described each parent and his relationships with them each very positively.[2]
family violence
the 25 september 2017 incident
the 30 january 2021 incident
mummy doesn’t want to be with you. look at the message mummy sent me saying she doesn’t want to be with you.[5]
the 19 june 2022 incident
harassing behaviour
the children became upset at me when i said no saying “you are rude to daddy.” [mr alvarez] encouraged the children by saying “yes mummy is rude to daddy. but it’s okay. daddy still loves mummy,” “mummy is being difficult” and “see daddy is trying but mummy is rude.” [mr alvarez] would say this with a smile on his face....[mr alvarez] behaved in similar ways when i made plans with the children and said no when he asked to join.[14]
i will come whenever i want. if i stay outside of your fence, its public property and you can’t make me leave.[16]
i will be there for my children in all events no matter what day it falls on. you create the problems and i have always made amends. so no deal. i know what is best for me because i’m the one that has been attending all of the activities - not you!!
for your dishonest and wilful deception of the court lying under oath and bringing false claims which will impact your ability to hold a law licence. you will very likely lose your licence and be disbarred.
if you concede the appeal and agree to appropriate orders for your contact with the children whilst they return living with me in sydney, i undertake not to commence the formal complaint and the contempt proceedings stated... given hearing is on monday i require an urgent answer.
thus the father was threatening to expose the mother to a possible loss of her livelihood if she did not accede to his demands in these proceedings, the very definition of coercive and controlling behaviour. the father’s attempt to disallow this tender on the basis that it was a settlement offer was not successful.
aww, so every time you call me day or night suddenly changed? i’ll let my children know as well that you will not answer their calls when they are with me (since they use my phone to call you). love you long time!
....it’s for the children you retard not for me..... ... you’re bf will see right through you one day and will run before he knocks you up with what’s left of you...... you should be dropping my things off if you’re here but you didn’t because you’re a bitch!!!!now f off since you are never useful for your own kids.”
...i’m only exchanging msgs [sic] because you and have children together!! other than that you’re just used goods [ms orana]...
tell her to get her shit together and to stop being a useless mother! ...everyone knows she is the devil (to say the least) but she’s your daughter! i hate having to deal with her but unfortunately i have to, she’s a dead beat mother who dumps my children to you....
i just gave you over $900 yesterday go spend it on your trip (don’t ever tell me you use it for the children). now fuck off with trip and use my money to support it hahahahahahahahaha fucking retard!!
you’re definitely just a part parent – shitty mother to be honest.
you mother fucker don’t ever speak about me like that to my children my niceness is finished mother fucker belittle me like that you think i can’t hear you stupid bitch you made your choice cunt because of you my son is how he is!! you ignored everything i told you about how has been affected be everything you have caused!! because he finds it hard to deal with everything that he is going through!! drop dead scum!
your [sic] good for a couple of years [ms orana] then down hill from there you’re just a whore who has been in a minimum of 10 or so relationships ...no one wants you...   orana’s] account is of concern, as she alleged that [mr alvarez] has engaged in persistent, threatening and intimidating behaviours in the post separation period. this type of behaviour is likely to undermine her capacity as a parent and she may be additionally vulnerable given her pregnancy. the children being consistently exposed to this behaviour is also likely to be harmful to their emotional wellbeing, their sense of safety and security and it could undermine their relationships with one or both parents.[19]
may be protective of her emotional well-being and mental health, and, may relieve her of the pressure she experiences from having ongoing contact with [mr alvarez]. it would also mean that the children are not living with a perpetrator of family violence.[20]
additional risk issues
parental conflict
exposure to parent conflict, which may have escalated to family violence, is detrimental to children’s wellbeing and it models to them inappropriate behaviours in managing conflict.[21]
the mother’s current partner
i don’t like it there. mummy always just wants to do what she and [mr c] plan for themselves. [mr c] doesn’t care about us, and mummy only listens to [mr c] and agrees with him when he is rude to us.”[24] the father further deposes that [x] has said “i have found mummy and [mr c] naked in the house and i don’t like being in the house daddy.[25]
you use all your money on [mr c] family is the most important thing. [mr c] isn’t family. daddy’s work is more important than yours. daddy needs his money to buy a house. [mr c] has his own house, so you don’t need your money. daddy gives you money to buy things for us, so you need to buy our things, not daddy.[28]
mental health issues
i become nervous, tense and restless. there is a rock feeling in my stomach, and i begin sweating. i have a strong feeling of panic and at times i begin trembling.[31]
the additional considerations: s60cc (3)
views of the children
it seems that there is a possibility that the children’s views of [mr c] have been influenced by [mr alvarez] and it is likely that this is also in part due to their difficulty adjusting to the changes in their family system. similarly, it is not uncommon for children to be reluctant to change schools, but this does not necessarily mean that they are not capable pf doing so if needed, rather it is difficult for them to imagine what the experience will be like.[35]
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with a parent
the parenting capacities of each of the parties
daddy loves you. it’s your fault we are not a family. daddy says you are mean to him. daddy wants us to all go out together. daddy is a nice person, but you are mean.[36]  : my mummy takes my daddy’s money. in the morning, my daddy has lots of money and by the end of the day he has nothing because mummy takes it all. [mr c]: that can’t be right. i doubt your mother would do that. [y]: it’s true. daddy showed us.[37]
the fact that the mother is 7 months pregnant as of the date of her affidavit [of] 2022, noting her relationship commenced with her partner on or about [2021], suggests recklessness, imprudence and parental irresponsibility. especially given the prematurity of the short term and long-distance relationship and the obvious implications which are now playing out for all parties including children. the applicant mother is the author of her own dilemma and petitions this court for an order to make it everyone’s dilemma to uproot the entire children’s world against their wishes and their entire family’s wishes in order to accommodate the applicant’s recklessness.
it seems likely that he will have difficulty supporting, if not purposefully undermine, the children’s relationship with [ms orana].[39]
father: “when i was little, someone punched me, and i hit them 3 times and busted their nose. that’s what you need to do when someone punches you.” [y]: “what is busting?” father: “it is breaking someone’s nose. that’s what you do when someone touches you. break their nose.” [y]: “no. no one is breaking anyone’s nose.”[40]
the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances
parental responsibility
it appears to us that as a parenting order, including an order for equal shared parental responsibility, must be in the best interests of a child, a court may in the exercise of its discretion find it is inappropriate to make such an order in certain circumstances. this could occur where, although there is no family violence or child abuse, the conflict or lack of effective communication between the parents is such that to properly exercise their equal shared parental responsibility they would be unable to comply with s 65dac by consulting and making a genuine effort to reach agreement about major long-term issues affecting their child or children. in other words, in these circumstances an order for equal shared parental responsibility would inevitably lead to further conflict and perhaps contravention applications, which conflict and/or ongoing litigation could be adverse to the child’s best interests.
