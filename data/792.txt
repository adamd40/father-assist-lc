the witnesses
the mother
the father  whilst he said that he now had a car capable of transporting the children, he gave evidence that it was purchased for his adult son mr g but was never given to him (mr g) and was now registered in the father’s partner’s name. (g) the explanation that he sought primary care due to the amount of time the children spend in out of school care was strange, as was the fact that his proposal sees the children spending each and every weekend during school term with the mother. (h) his evidence was that he would love to have the children on the weekend but that his proposal suits them better. in fact it appears to suit him better as he gave evidence of being able to work on the weekends. (i) when asked why he could not find the time to shower and change for the family report interviews, as noted in the family report, the father said that he had done so. then when he was asked if he was saying the family report writer was lying, his evidence was “the reason is very different, i won’t call her a liar”. when it was put to him that only one of them could be telling the truth he agreed and then laughed. (j) he gave similarly contradictory evidence about his reported failure to bring activities to the family report interviews. the family report writer later checked her notes and confirmed that his evidence in court was different to what he told her on the day. (k) when it was put to the father that he had told the family report writer that he was happy with the children’s the current living arrangements[1] his answer was that he would like to get more time. (l) his evidence was that he found out that z had an ndis package through the mother’s affidavit material. when he was challenged that mother had given him the ndis packages his evidence was convoluted and included that he was involved in the process through the school but ultimately repeated that he knew about it from the affidavit material. (m) his evidence that by not calling the children regularly he helps maintain a good relationship between the mother, the children and himself. (n) his contradictory evidence about when he ceased physical discipline. (o) his evidence about his legal fees. he gave evidence that he had paid about $2,000 and had outstanding fees in the vicinity of $50,000 plus $8,000 for his barrister. his evidence was that his lawyer had agreed to accept $500 per week to pay off those fees, which would take about 116 weeks or over two years. given his financial statement and evidence as to his limited income this was somewhat puzzling. on the other hand he gave evidence that he employs two people in his business.   the explanation that he sought primary care due to the amount of time the children spend in out of school care was strange, as was the fact that his proposal sees the children spending each and every weekend during school term with the mother.

part five: the law
...when dealing with a case concerning the future living arrangements for a child, and involving a significant change in the geographical place where the child is to live, the preferred approach according to established principle has been not to deal with that change, or relocation, as a separate or discrete issue, but rather as just one of the proposals for the child’s future living arrangements, at least in so far as that approach is possible...

equal time or significant and substantial time
dual minimum requirements of when the time is to occur and what the time is to achieve by way of mutual involvement of parent and child in each other’s lives relate to the dual aspects of the time being both substantial and significant respectively. a parenting arrangement will fail to meet the requirements of substantial and significant time unless it provides for time of a duration and frequency, and occurring at times, that enable the parent to be involved in the child’s daily routine.[5]
