relevant legal principles relating to costs in family law proceedings
... in exercising its discretion to award or refuse costs, a court should look at the matter primarily from the perspective of the defendant. to do so conforms to fundamental principle. if one thing is clear in the realm of costs, it is that, in criminal as well as civil proceedings, costs are not awarded by way of punishment of an unsuccessful party. they are compensatory in the sense that they are awarded to indemnify the successful party against the expense to which he or she has been put by reason of the legal proceedings.   where it appears that an action has been commenced or continued in circumstances where a party properly advised should have known that he had no chance of success. in such cases the action must be presumed to have been commenced or continued for some ulterior motive or because of some wilful disregard of the known facts,[13] (b) making allegations of fraud, knowing them to be false, and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud,[14] (c) evidence of particular misconduct causing loss of time to the court and to other parties,[15] (d) the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   making allegations of fraud, knowing them to be false, and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud,[14] (c) evidence of particular misconduct causing loss of time to the court and to other parties,[15] (d) the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   evidence of particular misconduct causing loss of time to the court and to other parties,[15] (d) the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions,[16] and/or (e) an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.   an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise.
determination
in a nutshell the husband and wife (collectively “spouses”) began cohabitation in [early] 2010. they have one child together, [x], who was born [...] 2017. the spouses separated on a final basis in march 2018. they were divorced in [late] 2019. in [mid] 2011, mr [vendric] and [ms b vendric], the wife’s parents, (collectively “parents”) purchased the property located at [e street], [suburb f] (“[suburb f] property”). at all material times they have been and remain the legal owners of the property. an arrangement was agreed to by the parties in or around [mid] 2011 that the husband and wife would live in the [suburb f] property and make regular payments pursuant to that arrangement. how these payments are to be classified and what their purpose was is in dispute. it is not in dispute that at the time of purchase of the [suburb f] property, the parents paid the deposit as well as the associated costs of purchase, such as stamp duty and conveyance costs. it is also not in dispute that the loan used to pay for the balance of the purchase price was taken out by the parents, and that they are the mortgagors and remain liable for the loan repayments. it is not in dispute that the spouses did not make any financial contributions towards the [suburb f] property at the time of purchase. the spouses moved into the [suburb f] property in [mid] 2011. they purchased various household items and there was work which was carried out on the property. between [mid] 2011 and [early] 2012, the spouses lived in the property and after a separation of many months, resumed living in the property from [early] 2013 until final separation in march 2018. during the time they lived in the [suburb f] property, the spouses made payments to the parents. the amount appears to have varied, but was on average $500 per week. however, the payments were not always made regularly, and there were periods when no payments were made. the husband claims that he and the wife hold an equitable interest in the property by reason of representations being made by and on behalf of the parents, and the husband relying on those representations to his detriment, by way of constructive trust consequent upon the payments made by them during the time they resided in the property as well as some improvements made to the property. the husband claims that the parties agreed that the spouses would be entitled to all of the equity in the property upon its sale, as well as any moneys which were held by the parents on their behalf as “savings”. the wife and the parents deny that a constructive trust arises, and say that the husband’s application for a declaration of trust should be dismissed. other than the [suburb f] property (which is in contention) the pool consists mostly of superannuation, but there are also motor vehicles, some savings and household contents.
procedural matters proceedings for both property and parenting orders were commenced by the husband in august 2019. on 21 october 2019, the husband was directed to file and serve points of claim, in relation to the claims he made against the second and third respondents. he did not do so, although an attempt at filing had been made. it appears however, that a document was at least served on the respondents on or about 2 december 2019, because each of them filed an affidavit annexing their points of defence in early 2020. on 28 may 2020, the husband was granted leave to file and serve an amended points of claim within 28 days. he did not do so. instead, on 16 september 2020, the husband’s solicitor swore and filed an affidavit, annexing the amended points of claim. while it is most unfortunate that the court’s order for the filing of pleadings have not been complied with, in the interests of justice, the court has in this instance taken a pragmatic approach to such failures and not treated them as fatal to the applicant’s case. the amended points of claim, were further sought to be amended, without leave having been obtained, through the written submissions which were made at the conclusion of the proceedings. litigation is to be conducted in an orderly fashion. it is not a process of unearthing the issues through the trial, the ambit of the dispute, the issues and the basis upon which the claim is made ought to be clear at the commencement of the hearing, particularly where parties have been directed to file pleadings and where evidence in chief is by way of affidavit. ... the husband is bound by the way that his case was pleaded, and in this regard the pleadings which the applicant is held to are the [points of claim] annexed to the husband’s written submissions filed 10 november 2021. the respondents are taken to have continued to rely on their points of defences (“pod”) as referred to at [14] above. the matter was originally listed for hearing in respect of both property and parenting on 8 and 9 february 2021, as a reserve. final parenting orders were made by consent on the day, and the matter was otherwise not reached. the property aspect of the proceedings was then listed for hearing on 11 and 12 october 2021, but was not completed within that time frame. a third day of hearing occurred on 19 october 2021, and the proceedings concluded with written submissions ultimately being filed. ... determination and relevant findings as noted above, before the court is able to determine, whether it is just and equitable to make a property adjustment order it is necessary to start by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. the primary issue for determination in these proceedings is whether the [suburb f] property forms part of the pool of assets subject to property adjustment orders. the applicant seeks a declaration pursuant to s.78 of the act that [mr vendric] and [ms b vendric] hold their right title and interest in the property “on constructive trust as to 100% of that right, title and interest or as to such percentage as this honourable court determines” for the husband and wife in equal shares, subject to the husband and wife “repaying” the parents the costs and expenses “to be assessed following disclosure” incurred by them in purchasing the property or that an equitable charge arises in favour of the husband and wife with respect to such costs and expenses. ... credit ... it became clear during the hearing that the husband took poetic licence with his evidence. at times the husband’s evidence was very vague, at times inconsistent and even outright misleading. an example of such evidence is that referred to at [113] dealing with the renovations to the property, noting the findings at [114]. the husband conceded that his evidence about the renovations was misleading, and that he did none of the work. he explained that he “thought [him]... being part of that house, and being there, and being subject to the whole thing... that [he]... was part of it”. the husband’s oral evidence went from saying that the reason they moved into the [suburb f] property in august 2011 was because the wife had an interest in the property (not the spouses) to saying “i recall the electricity bills arriving to the property but they were in your parent’s (sic) name, which i found very odd because we’re the people renting the apartment” when he was asked about paying the electricity bills. his affidavit referred to “us” as having conversations with the parents, but he then conceded that he never discussed such matters with the parents. the husband conceded that he did not understand the importance of being accurate and precise in his evidence in chief at the time he swore his trial affidavit, but that while “timeline things could be a little off...” he said that “... most of the rest of the affidavit is pretty accurate”. furthermore, noting the vague nature and imprecision of the husband’s evidence in respect of important matters, including matters which could easily have been checked against documents such as bank statements but appear not to have been before they were sworn to, unless the husband’s evidence is corroborated (in respect of contributions, where it is capable of being corroborated), it will be given little weight. on balance, where the evidence of the husband and that of the respondents conflicts, the court prefers the evidence of the respondents. this is not only so because of the difficulties with the husband’s evidence which have been identified, but it is also because of the implausibility of some of his assertions in general. conclusions as to the pool and determination... constructive trust the submissions made in the husband’s case that a constructive trust is established by both direct evidence of four sets of representations and circumstantial evidence of the conduct of the parties, is rejected. the husband’s evidence in respect of the constructive trust was a moving feast. in essence, the husband’s case was that the moneys which the spouses paid to the parents was to be placed into the parents’ “offset account” – except that there was no “offset account”. the husband then says that such moneys were to be used by the parents to reduce the interest payable on the property but at the same time act as a savings account for the spouses. if his evidence is accepted in this regard, that is all of the moneys the spouses paid was to be kept in this manner by the parents, it would mean that the spouses made no direct financial contributions towards the [suburb f] property whatsoever. even after the filing of evidence in chief, three days of hearing, and lengthy written submissions, the husband’s case remained confused. the four representations the representations have not been made out. on balance the court finds that the conversations between the parties about the purchase of the [suburb f] property, and the financial arrangements between the parties were in accordance with the evidence given by the respondents. ... agency despite pleading an agency by the wife on behalf of the parents, the husband has not established on the evidence that any agency, whether actual or apparent, existed... ... is the [suburb f] property held on trust for the spouses? ... the husband’s conduct after the alleged promise was inconsistent with a genuine belief in the representations he alleges, which are in any event, not found to have been made as asserted by the husband. if anything, the husband was a disinterested occupant of the property, who benefited from the arrangement between the parties. the evidence does not establish any detriment to the husband suffered as a result of the arrangement concerning the [suburb f] property. indeed, the husband (and the wife) benefited from the arrangement by being afforded a lifestyle that was “lavish”, and the ability for discretionary spending without the worry of loan repayment constraints or a landlord who expected to be paid on time all the time. the spouses benefited by living in a home they were secure in and had some autonomy about, they benefited by not having to make strict regular payments and having accommodations made for their somewhat lavish lifestyle. they travelled and went on holidays, they had their bills paid by the parents (and then they repaid them at their leisure), and they took payment breaks from time to time without any detriment or without threat of being evicted. ... the constructive trust asserted by the husband is more akin to a very generous gift than a trust. it is all benefit to the spouses without any risk or detriment. ... [the suburb f] property is property which the parents are the legal and beneficial owners of. the spouses have no equitable or legal interest in that property, including any equitable charge.[18]
the matters raised by her honour at r[13]-[16] refer to the points of claim, which the court noted were procedurally irregular (in the sense that they were in one instance not filed but rather annexed to an affidavit, and on another instance amended without leave)... [20]
