the court orders that:
ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge taglieri
our client respectfully requests that judgment not be delivered in this matter until she has been given an opportunity to be heard, including: (a) as to an application for disqualification of judge taglieri on the basis of prejudgment and apprehended bias as foreshadows in the submissions filed with the full court on behalf of [ms yarrow] on 16 september 2022, and referred to in the reasons delivered by the full court on 20 october 2022, and (b) the filing of further evidence to enable to court to properly give further consideration on the just and equitable division of the property of the parties under section 79 of the act as required by the full court’s remitter.   as to an application for disqualification of judge taglieri on the basis of prejudgment and apprehended bias as foreshadows in the submissions filed with the full court on behalf of [ms yarrow] on 16 september 2022, and referred to in the reasons delivered by the full court on 20 october 2022, and (b) the filing of further evidence to enable to court to properly give further consideration on the just and equitable division of the property of the parties under section 79 of the act as required by the full court’s remitter.   the filing of further evidence to enable to court to properly give further consideration on the just and equitable division of the property of the parties under section 79 of the act as required by the full court’s remitter.
our client has been awaiting communication from the court since 20 october as to the further listing of the matter.
however, in my view, that position on the respondent’s part is misconceived because very clearly in the full court’s reasons it stated, and i quote from paragraph 6 of the judgment:
all that remains to be done is the provision of further reasons pertaining to the primary judge’s consideration of matters listed in section 75(2) of the act, and particularly section 75(2)(b) and (n), and then the further exercise of the section 79 discretion based on the facts found by the primary judge.
