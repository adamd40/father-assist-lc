ms e and the father’s relationship with her
the father’s only meeting with x
“[mr hobb] [that is the father] stated that [x] had said the word dad during the visit. [mr hobb] said that he is [x]’s only father and that if he found out [mr c] ([ms arlington]’s [that is the mother’s] partner) was being called dad or was on site during the visits he would “smash his fucking face in.” [mr hobb] said that he should be the only person called dad and that of all the men in [x]’s life it should be him that gets the most time with him. [mr hobb]’s facial expression changed and he appeared angry and clenched his fists together. [mr hobb] went on to say that he was sure that the supervisor was about to approach territory that he was not liking around the word “dad” and that the supervisor might say something that angered him. the supervisor said that this was true so they would leave it for now. [mr hobb] expressed that if [mr c] was on site or in the car park and he saw him he would leave. when asked what had occurred between him and [mr c] in the past to make him feel this way, he talked about sending him messages when [ms arlington] and [mr c] initially got together asking for him to send pictures and information about his child, [mr c] refused to do this. [mr hobb] then spoke about his new baby and the things he was looking forward to that he missed out on during [x]’s first few years of life. [mr hobb] waited the appropriate amount of time and then left the service.”
father’s failure to undertake the recommended parenting and anger management courses and counselling by march 2021
“i am told through his counsel today that the father is prepared to address those matters prescribed by the children's contact service".
"ultimately, the father’s solicitor indicated to the court that, whilst it remains to be seen whether there is to be an amended response filed by the father, or some other application in relation to the paternal grandfather, the father's position and the fallback position is that he will comply with those requirements prescribed by the children's contact service."
the father’s lack of participation in x’s life in any meaningful way despite the opportunity being available to do so
the mother kept the fact of x’s birth from the father
x’s medical condition
the father’s relationship with x does not presently exist in any meaningful sense
the father’s experience with other young children is of little weight
the father’s position
family violence: introductory comments   it does not identify an injury to or an effect upon the father’s memory faculty, (b) it said the father was medically stable on the date of discharge appearing to be 2018, (c) it simply says after discharge a plan included “biru concussion clinic”. i am prepared to speculate (as i was not told directly in the evidence) that “biru” is likely to stand for “brain injury rehabilitation unit” without stating why, and (d) it comprised only “2 of 3” pages leading me to infer that anything to be put forward that was helpful to the father’s case on this topic was not to be found in the missing page 3 or otherwise and that the two pages tended as exhibit 6 represented the medical evidence at its highest.   it said the father was medically stable on the date of discharge appearing to be 2018, (c) it simply says after discharge a plan included “biru concussion clinic”. i am prepared to speculate (as i was not told directly in the evidence) that “biru” is likely to stand for “brain injury rehabilitation unit” without stating why, and (d) it comprised only “2 of 3” pages leading me to infer that anything to be put forward that was helpful to the father’s case on this topic was not to be found in the missing page 3 or otherwise and that the two pages tended as exhibit 6 represented the medical evidence at its highest.   it simply says after discharge a plan included “biru concussion clinic”. i am prepared to speculate (as i was not told directly in the evidence) that “biru” is likely to stand for “brain injury rehabilitation unit” without stating why, and (d) it comprised only “2 of 3” pages leading me to infer that anything to be put forward that was helpful to the father’s case on this topic was not to be found in the missing page 3 or otherwise and that the two pages tended as exhibit 6 represented the medical evidence at its highest.   it comprised only “2 of 3” pages leading me to infer that anything to be put forward that was helpful to the father’s case on this topic was not to be found in the missing page 3 or otherwise and that the two pages tended as exhibit 6 represented the medical evidence at its highest.
