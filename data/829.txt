family violence
put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79. we prefer this approach to the concept of ``negative contributions’’ which is sometimes referred to in this discussion. ... however, it is important to consider the ‘floodgates’ argument. that is, these principles, which should only apply to exceptional cases, may become common coinage in property cases and be used inappropriately as tactical weapons or for personal attacks and so return this court to fault and misconduct in property matters – a circumstance which proved so debilitating in the past. in addition, there is the risk of substantial additional time and cost. however, in our view, s 79 should encompass the exceptional cases which we described above. it would not be appropriate to exclude them as a matter of policy because of this risk. it is a matter of commonsense for the lawyers involved and, where that may not be sufficient, it is a matter for a firm hand by the court at an early stage when a case appears to raise those issues. it is essential to bear in mind the relatively narrow band of cases to which these considerations apply. to be relevant, it would be necessary to show that the conduct occurred during the course of the marriage and had a discernible impact upon the contributions of the other party. it is not directed to conduct which does not have that effect and of necessity it does not encompass (as in ferguson) conduct related to the breakdown of the marriage (basically because it would not have had a sufficient duration for this impact to be relevant to contributions). similarly, in killick v killick (1997) 21 fam lr 331 at 341, in proceedings under the de facto relationship act 1984 (nsw), the court of appeal rejected the argument for the male partner that incidents of infidelity during the relationship by the female partner should be taken into account as diminishing her contribution as homemaker or parent.
the incidence of domestic violence in a marriage would generally be a relevant factor when a court comes to assess contributions for the reason that the contributions made by a party who has suffered domestic violence at the hands of the other party may be all the more onerous because of that violence and therefore attract additional weight.

the law ] in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[17]
... indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis (1986) 161 clr 513).[25]  ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial “product” or “value”. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent “causal connection” might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the “...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...” or, indeed, to “property” at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to:
... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse’s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[27]
...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.[30]
as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.[31]
once property is vested in the trustee pursuant to the bankruptcy act, the trustee’s powers are extensively granted in s134 and in sections 139zj to 139zt of that act. in the present context, there is a power to “sell all or any part of the property of the bankrupt” in s134(1)(a). the trustee’s power when matrimonial property is owned just by the bankrupt is quite clear. bankruptcy severs joint tenancies so that the trustee and the non-bankrupt spouse become tenants-in-common (re butler’s trusts (1880) 38 ch.d: re holland, ex parte official trustee (1985) 5 fcr 165). however, where property is jointly owned, the trustee’s rights are no greater than those of the bankrupt as regards compelling a sale of the property. despite the armoury of weapons available to the trustee under the [bankruptcy] act, in order to compel a sale or partition of a jointly owned property, the trustee must either rely on common law or statutes other than the bankruptcy act. in new south wales, the trustee will rely on s66g of the conveyancing act 1919 (nsw) ...[32]
... the discharge operates to release him from all debts (including secured debts) provable in the bankruptcy, ...  ] his honour correctly stated the position of the trustees [in bankruptcy]’s and the power of the court:  ] a point of distinction, in circumstances where a party to the marriage has become bankrupt, is the fact that the sub – section 79(1)(b) empowers the court to make an order altering the interests of the official trustee in bankruptcy “... in the vested bankruptcy property.” this is in contrast to the court’s general power, where bankruptcy is not an issue, to alter the interests of the parties in the property of the marriage. the jurisdiction granted by the 2005 amendment act therefore enables a trustee to join proceedings for the purpose of resisting claims by a non-bankrupt spouse to vested bankruptcy property. the legislation does not, however, empower the respondent trustees to utilise the provisions of the [family law act] to enlarge the vested bankruptcy property available to the bankrupt spouses creditors.
the matrimonial asset pool
the respondents [the husband and the wife] pay the applicants’[sic] reasonable costs of these proceedings (including reserved costs), along with all other costs, charges and expenses of the sale of the property.
... is a third party and represents the interests of third parties to the marriage
he submitted that accordingly section 90ae of the act was enlivened.
... would be to empower the court to ignore unsecured creditors in contrast to the long-established principles in biltoft v biltoft [1995] famcafc 45, (1995) flc 92-614, murray & murray [2020] famcafc 293, (2020) flc 94-000 at [41] ... the connection between the matrimonial pool and the unsecured creditors is found in that these are debts of one of the parties to the marriage ...  ] ... in cases where there is “property” of the parties to the marriage or either of them, the effect of the 2005 amendments [to the family law act 1975 and to the bankruptcy act 1966] is that the court has jurisdiction to make orders which have an adverse impact upon unsecured creditors. in this regard the term “property” includes property vested in the trustee of a bankrupt spouse. [98] although not so expressed, implicit in the submission of counsel for the trustee that there could be no property with respect to which an order could be made in favour of the wife in this case is the reality that, if correct, such approach potentially and significantly enhances the position of an unsecured creditor. rather than having to “take its chances” on being paid, the unsecured creditor would be paid after the entitlements to secured creditors were satisfied, and without regard to the rights of the non-bankrupt spouse. that would be a fundamental change in the law. the fortuitous breakdown of the marriage of the debt or would, on that scenario, result in the unsecured creditor potentially being able to recover more than would have been possible had the debtor remained married. there is no apparent legislative foundation for such propositions. as counsel for the trustee fairly outlined to this court, by the insolvency (tax priorities) legislation amendment act the priority previously enjoyed by the ato has been removed and now ranks equally alongside other unsecured creditors. [99] it follows that i agree with the alternative proposition made on behalf of the trustee which i have earlier set out, namely that the effect of the insertion of s 79(1)(b) in the fla is that the interests of unsecured creditors do not automatically “trump” the interests of the non-bankrupt spouse and that the legislation requires the court to balance the competing claims in the exercise of the wide discretion conferred upon the court by s 79.  2] in particular, we agree that the court may make orders in favour of a non-bankrupt spouse, even though the combined liabilities exceed the total value of the property (including any property vested in the trustee). for the reasons coleman j as expressed, we do not accept the trustee’s contention that the trial judge was obliged to conclude there could be no property with respect to which any order could be made in favour of the wife.  2] we consider the submissions made on behalf of the trustee concerning the application of the pari passu principle to be misconceived. we can see no warrant in the words of the legislation, or in any of the other materials to which we were referred, for treating the entitlement of the wife under the fla in the same way as the entitlement of an unsecured creditor of the husband. [263] proven liabilities of an unsecured creditor are admitted in the administration of the bankrupt estate at full value. the entitlement of a non‑bankrupt spouse under the provisions of the fla are assessed only after proper regard has been paid to s 75(2)(ha) of the fla which requires the court to consider “the effect of any proposed order on the ability of a creditor of a party to recover the creditor’s debt, so far as that effect is relevant”. [264] although it will not always necessarily be so, it would seem that in many cases the application of s 75(2)(ha) will result in the assessment of the fla entitlement of the non‑bankrupt spouse at an amount less than he or she would otherwise have been entitled to receive. to then treat the resulting entitlement as if it were of the same character as the entitlement of an unsecured creditor would not, in fact, result in the “equal treatment” proposed by the counsel for the trustee. the entitlement of the unsecured creditor would be admitted at full value, whereas the entitlement of the non–bankrupt spouse may already have been heavily discounted as a consequence of the application of s 75(2)(ha). [265] we do not consider that the principles laid down by the high court in project blue sky inc v australian broadcasting authority (supra) advance the trustee’s argument. those principles concern the task faced by judicial officers when dealing with “conflicting statutory provisions”. on this issue, we do not discern any conflict between the provisions of the fla and the ba. [266] section 82 of the ba relevantly provides:   subject to this division, all debts and liabilities, present or future, certain or contingent, to which a bankrupt was subject at the date of the bankruptcy, or to which he or she may become subject before his or her discharge by reason of an obligation incurred before the date of the bankruptcy, are provable in his or her bankruptcy. (1a) without limiting subsection (1), debts referred to in that subsection include a debt consisting of all or part of a sum that became payable by the bankrupt under a maintenance agreement or maintenance order before the date of the bankruptcy...  7] section 108 of the ba provides:
except as otherwise provided by this act, all debts proved in a bankruptcy rank equally and, if the proceeds of the property of the bankrupt are insufficient to meet them in full, they shall be paid proportionately. [our emphasis added]  8] section 116(1) of the ba sets out the property divisible amongst the creditors but s 116(2)(q) specifically excludes from the list “any property that, under an order under part viii of the family law act 1975, the trustee is required to transfer to the spouse of the bankrupt”. [269] a potential “entitlement” to a settlement pursuant to s 79 of the fla is not properly characterised as a “present or future, certain or contingent” debt or liability, nor is it a debt or liability to which the bankrupt spouse “may become subject before his or her discharge by reason of an obligation incurred before the date of the bankruptcy” for the purposes of s 82(1) of the ba. [270] that this is so follows from authorities such as fisher v fisher [1986] hca 61, (1986) 161 clr 438 at 453 where mason and deane jj said:
true it is that orders made under s. 79 do not give effect to antecedent rights arising in virtue of the marital relationship. instead they perform a dual function by creating and enforcing rights in one blow, so to speak...  1] it follows that any potential entitlement to make a claim under s 79 of the fla and any entitlement arising under an order made pursuant to s 79 after the date of the bankruptcy are not a debt or liability provable in bankruptcy. the pari passu principle embodied in s 108 therefore has no application to such entitlements. [272] had parliament intended to treat the entitlement of the non–bankrupt spouse as if it were a debt provable in the bankruptcy, it could have so provided when enacting the 2005 amendments, for example by expanding the scope of s 82(1a) of the ba to include obligations pursuant to orders made after the date of bankruptcy in proceedings under the fla between the trustee in bankruptcy and the non–bankrupt spouse. parliament instead elected to enact s 116(2)(q) of the ba, which removes from the property available for distribution between creditors any property that the trustee is required to transfer to the spouse of the bankrupt under s 79 of the fla. in so doing, parliament ensured that there was no inconsistency between the operation of the fla and the ba. [273] accordingly there is no merit in ground 13 since there was no obligation upon his honour to have regard to “the principles of bankruptcy law that ... the proceeds of a bankrupt’s property be distributed pro rata amongst unsecured creditors” for the simple reason that the wife is not an unsecured creditor and any property to which she is entitled pursuant to an order made pursuant to s 79 would not be divisible amongst the unsecured creditors. [274] similarly, to the extent that ground 15 relies on the pari passu principle to suggest there was any obligation upon his honour to treat the wife and the husband’s creditors equally, it too has no merit.
the second set of debts which fall within the purvey [sic] or [sic] s 90ae are those expenses incurred by the trustee in bankruptcy in the exercise of its statutory duties.
the orders made on 18 june 2018 do not provide for the parties to jointly sell the property.
is it just and equitable in all circumstances to make an order altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property and/or altering the interests of the bankruptcy trustee in the vested bankruptcy property?
