reasons for judgmentex tempore
judge brown
in regards to future time-spending, essentially, [mr merritt] described a dynamic where [ms bruckner] encouraged an unhealthy attachment between [x] and herself. further, he alleged that she manipulated the circumstances by having the children make requests on her behalf. she gives the children the choice as to whether they spend the court ordered overnight with him, and offers to collect [x] at the end of the day. she feeds into and encourages [x’s] anxiety.
recorded: not transcribed
the children’s presentation at the assessment within their father’s care raised no concerns about their relationship with their father or their safety in his care. he continued to present as a loving, caring and capable father who had genuine concerns about their well-being, an understanding of their needs and a capability to meet those needs. he did not present as being malicious or self-focused in any way.[1]
the involvement with the school [and [mr merritt]] was not redolent with confrontation, complaint and threats of further complaint or censure.[2]
you must do everything a parenting order says. in doing so, you cannot be merely passive but must take positive action and this positive obligation includes taking all reasonable steps to ensure that the order is put into effect. you must also positively encourage your children to comply with the orders. for example, where the order states your children are to spend time with another party, you must not only ensure that the children are available but must also positively encourage them to go and do so.
tell the lady what you told me before. tell her.
the department has significant concerns in relation to [ms bruckner’s] inability to meet the children’s education and health needs as outlined within the judgment dated 27 october 2022. further to this, the department is concerned that [x], in particular, appears fixated with painting [mr merritt] and [ms f] in a negative light and views this likely as a result of [x’s] exposures to [ms bruckner’s] own views at the father’s household.
