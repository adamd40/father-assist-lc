legal principles
accordingly, we are of the opinion that until the high court holds otherwise, the court should proceed on the basis that s117 empowers the court to make litigation funding orders, including dollar for dollar orders.[25]
section 117(2a) of the act  in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2), the court shall have regard to:(a) the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters,
...keep my promise to [mr b] so if every last cent of his house money goes to the lawyer he would rather see it go to the lawyer than to anyone and i told my lawyer the same and it will stay in court until it is all gone.  whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and such other matters as the court considers relevant.
