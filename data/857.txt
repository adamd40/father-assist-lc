reasons for judgment
judge turnbull
overview
facts and chronology
when i returned to work, i was working evening shifts from 1.30pm to 10.30pm. for that reason, the children would sleep at [mr nilssen]’s and i would sleep at my house and i would go to [mr nilssen]’s house at about 7am of the morning being the time that the children would wake up.[25]   meng] and i together worked on renovating the property (“[ms meng]’s house”). i pulled out the old kitchen and project managed the renovations. i undertook all the negotiations with the various tradesmen in relation to the kitchen and laundry.[31]   nilssen] and his mother entered my home without my knowledge and painted the kitchen ceiling without permission. they also pulled out weed mats under trees without my permission. i did not consent to and was offended by those actions. on another occasion [mr nilssen] also pulled down our joint boundary fence without my permission. it costs me $860 to have it rebuilt. [mr nilssen] refused to share in the cost.[35]
the parties’ supported each other with the care of the children and contributed financially to the relationship. they planned to have children and moved in together two years after they met. this was a well thought through arrangement. the applicant moved from [city f] to live with the applicant. they maintained the support for each other, particularly in relation to the care of children, before and after the children’s births and when the respondent travelled to china. the applicant’s successful application for parenting payments added to the available monies.[46]

standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
issues for determination
issue 1: whether the loan from the respondent’s mother is an enforceable loan, a negative contribution to the asset pool or a gift?
i may not have told [mr nilssen] that i had borrowed money from my parents that i to repay. there was no reason for me to tell this to [mr nilssen]. i never considered that my personal finances were [mr nilssen]’s business. i repeat my evidence in my trial affidavit that the monies provided by my parents were by way of loan and that the loan together with interest remains payable.[54]
i am retired and my only income is a very small pension equivalent to $200.00aud per month which does not cover my necessary costs of living. i need payments from [ms meng] as and when she is able to make them. [ms meng] has returned to china about three times and on each occasion she has paid cash in part repayment. i travelled to australia and lived with [ms meng] which was at [ms meng]’s expense as part repayment.[60]
between 2012 and 2015 i returned to china three times and on each occasion i took cash towards part payment of the loan. my practice had been to return regularly to china to see my parents and to take them cash to make repayments. payment cash is the chinese way. by september 2019 covid-19 had struck and was known in china and therefore in september 2019 and june 2020 i made online transactions. annexed hereto and marked with the letter "g" are records of such payments made to my parents. the entries above 2016 are written by my father and those below 2016 are written by my mother. attached to the annexure is my english translation. the repayment of $6,032.00 in 2019 is shown in bank statements provided to [mr nilssen]’s solicitor by way of disclosure from my anz progress saver account number [...11]. the payment of $8,032.00 in 2020 was made from anz account number [...48]. i do not have a copy of the bank statement showing this payment but annexed hereto and marked with the letter "h" is a snapshot of the relevant account evidencing the debit on the 1st june 2020. my mother travelled to australia in 2016 and lived here for one year. all her expenses whilst in australia were paid by me. it was agreed that such payments were in part payment of the loan although there are no specific records. however, my mother had two [medical procedures] in australia at a cost of $12,912.58 paid by me.[62]
issue 2: whether it is just and equitable to make a property adjustment in the circumstances of case.
issue 3: should there be a superannuation splitting order in favour of the applicant?
issue 4: if it is just and equitable to make a property order, what is the appropriate division of the parties’ net assets?

preliminary matters
legal principles — property proceedings under parts viii and viiiab and the approach in hickey and stanford
for the purpose of determining the parties' legal and equitable interest in property should the loan the respondent received from her parents be regarded as a liability?
the courts approach to liabilities
the arrangement between the husband and the intervener was reached in a familiar context. justice ward (as she was then) in darmanin v cowan [2010] nswsc 1118 at [206] – [208] (“darmanin”) said of such contexts:
“there is a rebuttable presumption (being a presumption of fact) that arrangements or agreements made in [a social context] context are not intended to have legal force. the rationale or justification for making an assumption that there is no intention to create legal relations in such a situation is that, at the time of making the alleged promise, the parties would not have regarded their arrangements in terms of legal consequences. the presumption that, due to the nature of the relationship between the parties, they did not intend to create legal relations, has been applied beyond the family context to other social and domestic arrangements. in teen ranch pty ltd v brown (1995) 87 ir 308, handley, ja (p 310) indicated that family, social, and domestic arrangements do not normally give rise to binding contracts because the parties lack the necessary intention, referring to balfour v balfour [1919] 2 kb 571.”
the burden of discharging the assumption that the arrangement between herself and the husband was not intended to have legal force, and was a loan arrangement, rests with the intervener (see heydon v the perpetual executors trustees and agency co wa limited [1930] hca 26, (1930) 45 clr 111 at 113). whether the husband and intervener have evinced an intention to create legal relations is to be determined by an objective assessment of the evidence and not by reference to their subjective perceptions (see, e.g., chaudhary v chaudhary [2017] nswca 222 (“chaudhary”) at [100]). relevant to this assessment is “the subject matter of the agreement, the status of the parties to it, their relationship to one another, and other surrounding circumstances... and the certainty with which the parties have expressed their agreement” (see darmanin at [213]).
the characterisation of a particular advance of monies depends on whether the circumstances known to both parties to the transaction at the time demonstrate, objectively, that the payment was made by way of loan. if, for example, the money was paid upon the express condition that it should be repaid then, notwithstanding any absence of formal documentation, and regardless of the motivation for the payment, a contract of loan will exist: berghan v berghan [2017] qca 236, (2017) 57 fam lr 104. even if a contract of loan is established, it does not necessarily follow that any liability so created will be taken into account in determining a just and equitable alteration of property interests. the court may properly determine not to take into account an unsecured alleged liability in certain circumstances, including where the alleged liability is vague or uncertain or unlikely to be enforced: biltoft and biltoft [1995] famcafc 45, (1995) flc 92-614, rodgers & rodgers (no 2) (2016) flc 93-712, [41]–[42].[88]
in our opinion, in most cases it would not be appropriate for trial judges to treat a contingent taxation liability in this fashion. as a general rule trial judges should make a finding, on the balance of probabilities, as to whether or not such a liability exists, and if so in what amount. if it be found that such a liability exists, the court should take it into account when calculating the net amount available for distribution between the parties, but in an appropriate case discounting the amount of such liability if circumstances warrant, for example, through uncertainty as to the time for payment.(emphasis added)
it is in our view important to reiterate and emphasise what was said in biltoft above: there is no statutory prescription which suggests that any such treatment of the liability is mandatory. despite the frequency with which the “rule” is applied we have not been taken to any authority, nor are we aware of any authority, which suggests that any such “rule” has the effect of a binding rule of law. what emerges from the authorities is that while there might be a “rule” the application of which is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, the manner in which a particular liability should be treated is, ultimately, dependent upon the nature of the liability, the circumstances surrounding the liability and the dictates of justice and equity shaped by each. the usual practice or “rule” sits comfortably and conformably within that rubric – in many cases, perhaps almost all, liabilities will be deducted from the “gross” value of the property because it will be clear (and even if not expressly stated, determined) that the justice and equity of the case demands that the liabilities should be met by the parties in the proportions in which the court determines the property is to be divided.[31] liabilities that are vague, uncertain, unlikely to be enforced and the like might be treated differently because those circumstances might, in the circumstances of the particular case, render it unjust and inequitable for liabilities to be deducted in that manner. those so-called “exceptional cases” are but instances of the broader consideration of the justice and equity of the particular case. we conclude, therefore, that the failure of the trial judge to include the calculated taxation liability as a liability to be deducted so as to arrive at the value of the parties’ property is not, of itself, an error of law, and it was within discretion for her honour to treat the liability as a matter to be considered by reference to s 79(4)(e).[91](emphasis added)
it is of the essence of contract, regarded as a class of obligations, that there is a voluntary assumption of a legally enforceable duty. to be a legally enforceable duty there must, of course, be identifiable parties to the arrangement, the terms of the arrangement must be certain, and, unless recorded as a deed, there must generally be real consideration for the agreement. yet [t]he circumstances may show that [the parties] did not intend, or cannot be regarded as having intended, to subject their agreement to the adjudication of the courts.[101]
although i was due to commence repayment of the loan when i obtained secure employment my parents were generous in [sic] allowing me to save some monies before commencing repayments. their generosity continued when i purchased the property at [o street, town j] and when i started to have children. however, the generosity was as to the timeframe for me to make payments. there was never any agreement that i not have to repay both the capital and interest. my parent were not well off and my mother is not well off. it was a huge financial burden for my parents to finance my travel and study in australia. as my parents were flexible in the time for me to make repayments the interest on the capital has continued to accrue on a compounded basis and therefore i still owe some $196, 000.00.[107]
whilst there is uncertainty about how the recent payment of $100,000 ought be apportioned across the categories of use, the bottom line figure is clear and the quantum is agreed (albeit not whether it be included or excluded in the balance sheet). similarly, whilst the wife was vague and uncertain in the witness box about how sums had been applied, there was nothing vague or uncertain about the quantum in dispute. i accept the evidence of mr dd and the wife, that the loan is to be repaid. there was neither challenge nor submission made, which was appropriate in the circumstance, that the sum was unreasonably incurred. i conclude that it was not. a court may also take the view that because of the circumstances surrounding the incurring of a liability, it ought, in justice and equity, be wholly or partly disregarded in determining the appropriate order to make under s 79 of the act as between the parties to the marriage. such a result could be reached where a spouse had incurred a liability in deliberate or reckless disregard of the other party’s potential entitlement under s 79 (kimber and kimber [1980] famca 48, (1981) flc 91-085, kowaliw and kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092, antmann and antmann [1980] famca 64, (1980) flc 90-908, af petersens and af petersens [1981] famca 50, (1981) flc 91-095). there was no suggestion here that the wife borrowing from her family for the purposes described was in any way a “deliberate or reckless disregard of the other party’s potential entitlement under s 79”. i was not asked to make such a finding and will not. i now turn to the whether, in the circumstances of the matter, i ought include the whole amount of the loan, some lesser amount or nothing at all. the problem with the middle proposition (some lesser amount) is that the parties ran their cases that either the sum was all in, or all out. i will follow the approach which they have taken. to do something else (that is, some lesser amount) would require me to create some arbitrary approach contrary to the parties’ positions on this matter and submissions made. i will not do that. i am thus left with the parties’ all or nothing contentions.[114](emphasis added)
by reference to the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, is it just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s90sm?
the parties conducted their affairs in such a way that neither party would or could have acquired an interest in the property owned by the other because:- there was no intermingling of their respective finances. the parties did not have a joint bank account. each party acquired property in their own name with there being little exchange of the detail of these acquisitions to the other party. each party remained responsible for their own debts. each party was able to use the remainder of their wages as they chose without explanation or accountability to the other party. there was a complete lack of joint financial decision making. there was the absence of sharing of any information with each other as to their financial situation or individual decision making. neither party make provision for the other party in the event of their death either by way of will, beneficiary to superannuation funds or beneficiary to life insurance policies. the parties at the time of separation were unaware as to the worth of the assets acquired by each of the parties during the relationship and the decisions that had been made in respect to the acquisition of these assets.[115]
the overview of contributions and of the husband and wife’s future needs, taken together with the whole of the evidence, including their current circumstances, their history of maintaining separate finances, the lack of any co-owned property or joint financial ventures of any nature outside of four household appliances, the total lack of evidence in relation to the wife’s serbian property other than the fact of her ownership and its origin, the duration of the cohabitive relationship, and the lack of any element of cross contribution post separation, lead me to find that in all the circumstances i am not satisfied that it is just and equitable to make an order under section 79(2) of the act.
the legal interest of the parties reflect their historic and intended arrangements, and in the husband’s case his intentions in his will (made during the marriage) to provide no share of his assets to the wife. the wife’s will, which provided for her estate to be left to her children, was unchanged by her following marriage, it appears in ignorance of the now not so well known legal rule that invalidates wills made prior to marriage.[123]
the execution of the deed remains central to the appellant's challenge. the deed, executed at a time when there was no suggestion that the respondent was under pressure, was premised on the appellant's 50 per cent interest in the property being preserved for the benefit of her siblings in the event of her death, including at a time when she and the respondent were separated or divorced. why, she asks, is it just and equitable for the court to disturb the parties' interests in the property without making reference to what they had themselves agreed? the primary judge appreciated the necessity of identifying the parties' existing legal and equitable interests in property before determining whether it was just and equitable to make orders, as each party had invited the court to do, altering those interests. this was a brief marriage, which was not shown to have affected the appellant's earning capacity. there were no children whose interests stood to be affected by any alteration of the parties' interests in property. in the circumstances, arguments may be envisaged for and against finding that it was just and equitable to make a property settlement order. in the event, the arguments pressed on the appellant's behalf in this court were not put to the primary judge and his honour cannot be criticised for not addressing them. (emphasis added and citations omitted)
the evidence establishes that there was a general fluidity, where the parties' occupied separate residences at times but maintained a daily connection with the children primarily in the applicant’s residence. the respondent did not rent her home out, as she might have if the parties' were living solely in the applicant’s home. but there would have been little useful purpose in situating a bed and other amenities in her home if it was not going to be occupied from time to time. the arrangement was that the applicant would care for the children when the respondent was working and she would take over after work. he cared for the children for 6 weeks upon one of the respondents trips to china. this general fluidity was necessary as the children were being cared for at both properties but [y] in particular slept at the applicants. it makes sense for the respondent to sleep at the applicants as well given that reality.[124]
as stated i find that the parties' occupied the applicant’s home with their children from 2012 until 2017. the fact that they lived together as a family shows a commitment to a shared life. the applicant’s mother visited and stayed with the family annually. the respondent’s mother came to stay in tasmania in the respondent’s home for a year in 2016. both of the parties' parents participated in their family life and assisted with care of the children. this involvement of external family members in the parties' affairs points to more than a relationship of convenience as the respondent describes it. the applicant was involved in organising trades people to renovate the respondent’s home. he even assisted with this whilst the respondent was in china in 2017. the applicant’s friend mr r assisted with the dismantling of the kitchen. the respondent claims that she paid mr r and the applicant for this work. no evidence as produced to corroborate the contention. all of these contributions demonstrate that that the parties' were deeply involved in one another’s lives. they were doing more for each other than just raising children, in the transactional way the respondent claims. they were working together, assisting each other and supporting one another, sometimes with the assistance of their mothers.[125]
leading to the conclusion:
the parties' supported each other with the care of the children and contributed financially to the relationship. they planned to have children and moved in together two years after they met. this was a well thought through arrangement. the applicant moved from city f to live with the applicant. they maintained the support for each other, particularly in relation to the care of children, before and after the children's births and when the respondent travelled to china. the applicant’s successful application for parenting payments added to the available monies. the applicant may have wanted more from the respondent in help with his mortgage payments towards the end of the relationship. this hints at wanting her to contribute the dwelling she was occupying. this created friction. of note is the fact that notwithstanding the applicant’s claim for child support was not actually paid other than in kind. i note that the parties' finances were not intermingled and that they have separate property. the fact that the parties' had [y] years after the applicant’s receipt of government monies also supports a finding that the parties were maintaining a relationship notwithstanding the representations made. but there was more than just the care of children that defined their relationship. the applicant’s work on the respondent’s home while she was overseas is also demonstrative of a commitment to their relationship. the parties' mothers were also welcome participants in their lives and provided assistance.
...the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship.[126] (emphasis added)
the parties' non-superannuation assets
section 90sm(4)(a)-(c) — contributions
section 90sm(4)(a) — direct or indirect financial contributions to property
the approach adopted by the parties before her honour is repeated in the supplementary submissions filed on behalf of the respondent husband, it is there asserted that “the contributions of the parties would be equal aside from gifting by the husband’s father of significant parcels of land which remain in existence at the present point in time”. counsel for the wife, in his further submissions, makes no such specific assertion but implicitly does so by relying upon the trial judge’s findings and manner of assessment. for the reasons given earlier, we reject that approach, the gifts by the husband’s father should be taken into account as a contribution together with the miscellany of other contributions made by each of the parties over the course of their marriage.[127]
yet, that approach must also ensure that the “myriad of other contributions” and the duration over which, and circumstances in which, the miscellany of other s 79(4) contributions were made is not accorded a subsidiary role. the essential s 79(4) task is for “trial judges [to] weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation.[128]
as can be sees the primary judge weighed the myriad contributions made by the parties against the contribution made by the husband in bringing in property a rather than treating property a as one of the myriad contributions made.[129]
section 90sm(4)(b) — direct or indirect non-financial contributions to property

conclusion regarding the parties’ contributions
section 90sm(4)(d)-(g), including s 90sf(3) — other factors
section 90sm(4)(d) – the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the de facto relationship
a capacity to obtain income which could be used to provide maintenance ... and not merely as current income from personal exertion or from the use of personal skills.[133]
section 90sm(4)(e) – the matters referred to in subsection 90sf(3) so far as they are relevant
section 90sf(3)(a) — the age and state of health of each of the parties
section 90sf(3)(b) — the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment
it has long been recognised that in most cases the most valuable “asset” which a party can take out of the marriage is a substantial, reliable, income-earning capacity: see best and best [1993] famca 107, (1993) flc 92-418 at 80,295. [135]
in addition, it should not be forgotten that the payment of child support in no way compensates the custodial parent for the loss of career opportunity, lack of employment mobility and the restriction on an independent lifestyle which the obligation to care for children usually entails: see langford (16 january, 1995, full court, not reported).[136]
section 90sf(3)(c) — whether either party has the care or control of a child of the de facto relationship who has not attained the age of 18 years

conclusion regarding the matters referred to in s 90sm(4)(d)-(g)
conclusion regarding the parties' non-superannuation assets
superannuation
in summary, then, the trial judge has a discretion as to how superannuation interests will be treated in a particular case. if superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to: (a) value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties’ property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable. in the context of a consideration of the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of the last paragraph, the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation, actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse’s present and/or future entitlements under the fund.[141](emphasis added).
in our view it is clear from those comments that the majority in [c & c] was concerned with a consideration of actual contributions where they were ascertainable. the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation might be relevant in a defined benefits scheme whereas actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation might be relevant to an accumulation fund where in both cases the marriage was of short duration. however, in our view there is nothing said by the majority in [c & c] that would give any support for the application of some kind of a formula or that contributions to superannuation whatever the nature of the fund, should be treated in a different way from contributions to other property under s 79(4). this is so in our view whether the superannuation is considered as part of one pool of assets or in a separate pool.

conclusion regarding the parties' superannuation entitlements
what is the just and equitable exercise of discretion?
... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s. 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[142]
