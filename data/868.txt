i acknowledge that in the past, including during the marriage, that there have been incidents where i have engaged in physical discipline of the children and i have accepted full responsibility for my conduct. whilst i do not intend to minimise what occurred, i do say that these incidents occurred during a period of 18 months in which i was ending work, suffering from financial and emotional pressure.
the husband provides response to the specific events asserted by the wife in paragraph 187 of his trial affidavit.
at no time has [mr kalgreen] been physically abusive towards me. he has however been increasingly emotionally and psychologically abusing me. he constantly says that i am overreacting and making things up. i feel scared that he will continue to hurt children and want him to leave our family home so that we can be safe.
at times in 2016 and 2017 [ms kalgreen] an [sic] i had some verbal confrontations, most notably stemming from my discipline of the children above. however, i deny that i have been abusive or intimidating to [ms kalgreen] and the confrontations have been mutual in their intensity and language used towards one another.
in spite of these intermittent symptoms, [ms kalgreen] has maintained a high level of functioning throughout the course of treatment, continuing to run her own business while providing the majority of the care for the three children. at no time has there been any indication to me that [ms kalgreen]’s symptoms have impeded her ability to care for the children.

marriage is for most couples an economic partnership. married couples live together and work together with the ultimate object of purchasing a home, paying it off, acquiring other assets with the overall object of attaining a higher standard of living. the reported decisions in respect of applications for settlement of property under sec. 79 of the act are unanimous that both parties should share the economic fruits of a marriage, having regard to the provisions of sec. 79(4) and sec. 75(2), although not necessarily equally. is not, however, the converse equally sustainable? in other words, should not financial losses incurred by parties to a marriage or either of them, whether incurred jointly or severally, be shared by them in the same manner as the financial gains? as a statement of general principle i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. conduct of the kind referred to in para. (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under sec. 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of sec. 79.   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   $185,000 in loan repayments, (b) $145,000 in farm costs, (c) $19,000 to builders,   $145,000 in farm costs, (c) $19,000 to builders,   $19,000 to builders,

in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[18]   first, “the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities, and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing”,[20] (b) second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [21] (c) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[22] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[23]   second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [21] (c) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ...

... indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis (1986) 161 clr 513).[26]  ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial “product” or “value”. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent “causal connection” might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the “...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...” or, indeed, to “property” at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to:  ] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c).

... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse’s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[29]
...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.[31]
as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.[32]
addbacks ] to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are: (a) where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm v jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) 23 fam lr 396 the full court said (at 410-411):
11.6 for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out.   where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in in marriage of townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said (at 509):
in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly.   in the circumstances outlined by baker j in in marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70, [1981] flc 91-092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. conduct of the kind referred to in para. (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under sec 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of sec 79. [31] as the full court said in browne v green [1999] famca 1483, [1999] flc 92-873 at 86,360:  ] we agree with her honour that the principles stated by baker j in kowaliw certainly do not constitute any form of fixed code. they are no more than guidelines for use in the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction conferred by s 79 of the family law act 1975. nevertheless, they have over the considerable period of time since they were enunciated, become a well accepted guideline in this jurisdiction — a guideline the use of which assists in the achievement of the important goal of consistency within the jurisdiction.[35]
where one party unilaterally distributes to themselves property which no longer exists and which, but for that premature distribution, would be susceptible to section 79 orders, justice and equity may require the court to take account of the dissipated property by adding it back as against the dissipating party (townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569). whether that should occur, or whether the dissipation should be taken into account pursuant to section 75(2)(o), or indeed at all, are all matters requiring the exercise of a trial judge’s discretion (in the marriage of ad and ac townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569, ajo & gro, cerini & cerini [1998] famca 143).[37]  7] at [50] to [65] of the first reasons under the heading “add-backs,” the trial judge held that $25,000 withdrawn by the husband from the parties’ bank accounts post-separation should be added back into the pool of assets, and further concluded that $50,000 which the husband had, post-separation, paid to his parents, purportedly in repayment of a loan from them, should also be added back. [138] there is no error committed per se in adjusting the parties’ actual property interests by a calculation involving notionally adding back into the pool sums which have been dissipated by the parties. we reject any suggestion that the decision of bevan & bevan [2013] famcafc 116, (2013) flc 93-545 – or, more particularly, the decision of the high court in stanford & stanford (2012) 247 clr 108 - is authority for any necessary contrary solution. some statements made by the high court may lead to the conclusion that references to “notional property” as have been referred to in decisions of this court and at first instance may need to be reconsidered. [139] the decisions referred to seek to remind the court that, however the exercise of discretion might seek to deal with property that is said to be the subject of “add back”, proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property, and the question posed by s 79(2) as a separate inquiry from any adjustment to property interests by reference to s 79(4) if a consideration of s 79(2) reveals that it is just and equitable to alter existing interests in property.[38]  ] we observe that “notional property”, which is sometimes “added back” to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute “property of the parties to the marriage or either of them”, and thus is not amenable to alteration under section 79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage – and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that section 79(4) and in particular section 75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property.[39]  ] ... the way in which non-existent property is to be treated remains a matter for judicial discretion (see townsend & townsend flc 92-569) ... the provision of an agreed balance sheet providing for the inclusion of notional property would not mandate his honour’s acceptance of it or that he would treat the notional property in the same way as had the parties.[40]  0] ... a court cannot create property for the purposes of alteration. section 79 empowers a court to alter interests of the parties to the proceedings in property. property is defined in section 4 of the act to mean:
... [in] relation to the parties to a marriage or either of them – means property to which those parties are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or reversion.  1] as french cj said in kennon & spry [2008] hca 56, (2008) 238 clr 366 at 390, “‘property’ in section 79 is to be read as part of the collocation ‘property of the parties to the marriage’”. it is to be read widely and conformably with the purposes of the act. gummow and hayne jj said at 397 that “the term ‘property’ is not a term of art with one specific and precise meaning”. the purpose of the act as set out in section 79(1) is to alter interests in property to which a party has an interest in possession or reversion.[41]
guidelines for adding back to the property available at trial (a) dissipation of property and expenditure other than on legal fees  ] the full court held in ajo & gro[42] that addbacks fall into “three clear categories”: where the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and “waste” or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets.[43] [28] however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever “a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation”, the full court describing such a proposition as “unduly simplistic”.[44] an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is “the exception rather than the rule”.[45] [29] the fundamental precept that addbacks are exceptional, reflected in the decisions just referred to, also mirrors what has been said in earlier decisions of the full court that, for example, “the family court must take the property of a party to the marriage as it finds it”[46] at trial. an important parallel proposition is that the parties do not “go into a state of suspended economic animation” after separation.[47] thus, reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback. [30] two fundamental premises emerge from ajo & gro and the authorities preceding it. first, “adding back” is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.[48]  ] however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever “a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation”, the full court describing such a proposition as “unduly simplistic”.[44] an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is “the exception rather than the rule”.[45] [29] the fundamental precept that addbacks are exceptional, reflected in the decisions just referred to, also mirrors what has been said in earlier decisions of the full court that, for example, “the family court must take the property of a party to the marriage as it finds it”[46] at trial. an important parallel proposition is that the parties do not “go into a state of suspended economic animation” after separation.[47] thus, reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback.

[57] if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. [58] if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post‑separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post‑separation income or acquisitions.  ] those passages can be seen as an attempt to establish “guidelines”,[49] undertaken after a detailed examination of earlier authorities,[50] for the treatment of paid legal fees within s 79 proceedings. there can be little doubt that the statements made in that case have been applied by trial judges ever since. [33] the word “guidelines” is used advisedly so as to distinguish the same from “binding principles of law”.[51] the distinction is important. failure to follow a binding principle of law is an error of law. by contrast, the failure of a trial judge to follow a guideline:[52]  ] the word “guidelines” is used advisedly so as to distinguish the same from “binding principles of law”.[51] the distinction is important. failure to follow a binding principle of law is an error of law. by contrast, the failure of a trial judge to follow a guideline:[52]
...does not of itself amount to error, for it may appear that the case is one in which it is inappropriate to invoke the guideline or that, notwithstanding the failure to apply it, the decision is the product of sound discretionary judgment. [however] [t]he failure to apply a legitimate guideline to a situation to which it is applicable may ... throw a question mark over the trial judge’s decision and ease the appellant’s burden of showing that it is wrong...  ] the guidelines emerging from chorn should be read together and read conformably with the full court authorities upon which they are based. that being so, the delineations there referred to — “the funds used existed at separation ... such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them”, or “funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours” or received by a party “in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)” - cannot be seen as determinative of the exercise of discretion but, rather, as informing it. [35] again, the matters just referred to have important ramifications in an appellate context. they may ease the appellant’s burden of showing that “although the nature of the error may not be discoverable ... a substantial wrong has in fact occurred”,[53] or that the decision is “plainly wrong, [the] decision being no proper exercise of [the] judicial discretion”.[54] equally, they may ease the burden of establishing that irrelevant considerations have been taken into account or that relevant considerations have not been taken into account. [36] paid legal fees occupy a particular position in the consideration of addbacks by reason of s 117(1) of the act, a matter not relevant to any other form of expenditure or dissipation of property the subject of an addback claim. [37] an order failing to addback legal costs is a pre-emptive decision about one party paying the other’s legal costs. the statutorily prescribed default position is that neither party pays all or some of the other party’s costs.[55] [38] if, contrary to the demands of that section, there is to be a payment of costs, the award is dependent upon a finding of justifying circumstances which, in turn, is dependent upon (non-exhaustive) considerations all of which are informed by antecedent events - for example, whether one party has been “wholly unsuccessful” and “the conduct of the parties to the proceedings”.[56] an award of the costs of trial, if any, is in the usual run of events made after the respective entitlements of the parties to a settlement of property have been assessed and, importantly, any awarded costs are paid from the assessed entitlement to property received by the paying party. [39] as has been said, legitimate guidelines “guide the exercise of a discretion”, they do not replace it.[57] guidelines, must “[preserve], so far as it is possible to do so, the capacity ... to do justice according to the needs of the individual case”.[58] the decision to addback or not addback paid legal fees remains a matter of discretion. but, a finding that it is just and equitable to not addback an amount of legal fees so paid is a finding that it is just and equitable for the other party to contribute to the costs of the first party in that proportion as part of an overall assessment of the justice and equity governing their property division. [40] the considerations just referred to are plainly always important and central to the exercise of that discretion in respect of paid legal fees. [41] the passages from chorn, quoted above, draw a distinction between legal costs met from property that would otherwise be available at trial and legal costs met from funds “generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)”. the proposition there advanced, that such expenditure “would generally not be added back”, also needs to be seen as a guideline informing the relevant discretion rather than determining it. a further distinction is suggested in chorn between funds generated in that manner and “[f]unds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement”. [42] the latter suggestion recognises the discretion inherent in the task and also, perhaps, that in the particular circumstances of a case, adding back sums generated post-separation in the different manners suggested might create injustice as much as it might cure it.[59]  ] again, the matters just referred to have important ramifications in an appellate context. they may ease the appellant’s burden of showing that “although the nature of the error may not be discoverable ... a substantial wrong has in fact occurred”,[53] or that the decision is “plainly wrong, [the] decision being no proper exercise of [the] judicial discretion”.[54] equally, they may ease the burden of establishing that irrelevant considerations have been taken into account or that relevant considerations have not been taken into account.

...  ] in stanford v stanford,[60] the high court emphasised as fundamental that a consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order begins by “identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property”.[61] [47] the essence of a claim for addbacks is that the asserted sum/s should be added to the value of the existing property interests of the parties and, subsequent to the assessment of contributions, credited to the spending party as part of the value of their assessed entitlements. doing so does not offend what was emphasised by the high court. adding back does not seek to create property interests that do not exist. rather, doing so emphasises that satisfying the respective requirements of ss 79(2) and (4) of the act to do justice and equity can require an “accounting” or “balance sheet” exercise for the purposes of s 79(2) and (4), so as to include the value of the dissipated property or expended sums within the total value of the parties’ existing interests in property, and to credit the value of same against the assessed entitlement of the dissipating or spending party.[62]  ] the essence of a claim for addbacks is that the asserted sum/s should be added to the value of the existing property interests of the parties and, subsequent to the assessment of contributions, credited to the spending party as part of the value of their assessed entitlements. doing so does not offend what was emphasised by the high court. adding back does not seek to create property interests that do not exist. rather, doing so emphasises that satisfying the respective requirements of ss 79(2) and (4) of the act to do justice and equity can require an “accounting” or “balance sheet” exercise for the purposes of s 79(2) and (4), so as to include the value of the dissipated property or expended sums within the total value of the parties’ existing interests in property, and to credit the value of same against the assessed entitlement of the dissipating or spending party.[62]
credit 33] i do not set great stock by my observation of witnesses’ demeanour in giving their evidence. a thoroughly honest though very nervous person may seem hesitant, edgy, and at times almost evasive, whilst a thoroughly untruthful, cool, calculating, and controlled witness may present as eminently believable when based only upon demeanour. i do place some weight in considerations contemplated by the authorities, such as a witness’ responsiveness to a question.
assessing witness veracity  ] during the course of the trial i had the opportunity of carefully observing the applicant and respondent, their demeanour in the witness box especially. consequently, i was able to observe not only what they said but how they said what each said. [75] in terms of witness veracity, at this point it is useful to record certain observations about the way a court is required to proceed with the assessment of a witness’s evidence.

what are the factors that a judge takes into account when deciding whether a witness is telling the truth? they may be listed as follows – [1] the inherent consistency of the story: if the evidence of the witness contains internal contradictions, it cannot be accepted as a whole. the question may be which part to reject. [2] consistency with other witnesses: this, of course, involves making an assessment also of the other witnesses, which in turn requires consideration of the factors here set out in relation to those witnesses also. [3] consistency with undisputed facts: these include documentary evidence (if not subject to attack), facts admitted by the parties, or matters of common knowledge or experience. [4] the ‘credit’ of the witness: in addition to the observation of his performance in the witness-box, this will include ... evidence of bias against a party, or evidence of a general reputation for mendacity. [5] observation of the witness: this includes physical manifestations of truthfulness or mendacity, or of uncertainty, and also characteristics observable in the witness-box or capable of being tested there (hearing and eyesight, capacity to judge distance or height) ... [6] the inherent probability or improbability of the story.  ] the first consideration as identified above by sir richard eggleston where a witness’s evidence contains internal contradictions, the question of which part of the witness’s evidence should be accepted and which part rejected has been surveyed in dublin wicklow and wexford rly co v slattery (1878) 3 app cas 115 and christmas v nicol bros pty ltd [1941] nswstrp 47.

in his instructive article entitled the judge as juror: the judicial determination of factual issues (thomas bingham, ‘the judge as juror: the judicial determination of factual issues’ (1985) 38(1) current legal problems), published in current legal problems 38, mr justice bingham (as he then was) made this observation –
the main tests needed to determine whether a witness is lying or not are, i think, the following, although their relative importance will vary widely from case to case – (1) the consistency of the witness’s evidence with what is agreed, or clearly shown by other evidence, to have occurred, (2) the internal consistency of the witness’s evidence, (3) consistency with what the witness has said or deposed on other occasions, (4) the credit of the witness in relation to matters not germane to the litigation, (5) the demeanour of the witness. ] as to that last point, demeanour, i was also able to observe demeanour of the key witnesses, a fact that provided a considerable advantage as was reflected in an array of cases. those cases include coghlan v cumberland [1898] uklawrpch 74, [1898] 1 ch 704, dearman v dearman [1908] hca 84, owners of ss hontestroom v owners of ss sagaporack, ss hontestroom v ss durham castle [1927] ac 37, paterson v paterson [1953] hca 74, warren v coombes [1979] hca 9, brunskill v sovereign marine & general insurance co ltd [1985] hca 61, jones v hyde [1989] hca 20, abalos v australian postal commission [1990] hca 47, devries v australian national railways commission (1993) 177 clr 472, state rail authority of new south wales v earthline constructions pty ltd [1999] hca 3, fox v percy [2003] hca 22 and husain v o & s holdings (vic) pty ltd [2005] vsca 269. [82] it is important not to give too much credence to demeanour when considering the evidence of a witness. in fox v percy [2003] hca 22, the high court observed that it can be dangerous to place too much reliance upon the appearance of a witness rather than focusing on more objectively reliable matters. [83] demeanour is relevant in assessing witness credibility but i have not relied solely on witness credibility in this case. even unchallenged evidence may be accepted but if it does not go to a fact in issues then the utility of that unchallenged evidence diminishes. to the extent that unchallenged evidence addresses a fact in issue, it is long established that unchallenged evidence need not be accepted if it is inherently incredible or inherently improbable. cases standing for that proposition include precision plastics pty ltd v demir [1975] hca 27, ellis v wallsend district hospital (1989) 17 nswlr 553, levinge v director of custodial services (1987) 9 nswlr 546 and allied pastoral holdings pty ltd v federal commissioner of taxation (1983) 1 nswlr 1.

...witnesses are supposed to answer questions put by counsel responsively: they are supposed to give a full answer, but no more. it is one thing to say that a witness was not asked the right questions. it is another thing to say that a witness did not answer the questions that were asked. and it is an even more serious thing to say that a witness was "reluctant" to answer. the duty of a witness is to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so far as the questions asked seek it. the duty of a witness to answer questions responsively involves not only a negative duty (not to volunteer material for which the question does not call), but also a positive duty (to proffer all material within the witness's knowledge for which the question does call).  ] so far as the benefit enjoyed by a trial judge on matters of witness assessment and credibility are concerned, it is useful to identify the observations on point by the high court in louth v diprose [1992] hca 61. there, the court was concerned with an appeal on factual findings made by the learned trial judge, king cj of the supreme court of south australia. an appeal to the full court of the supreme court against factual findings made in support of conclusions about unconscionable conduct was dismissed. on further appeal to the high court those factual findings were not disturbed. various members of the high court made observations about the fact-finding process in which a trial judge engages. deane j held as follows –
as rich j. observed in wilton v farnworth [1948] hca 20, in a judgment with which dixon and mctiernan jj. agreed, a trial judge in an undue influence case in which the parties directly involved give evidence ordinarily enjoys an immeasurable advantage in estimating the characters and capacities of those involved in the impugned transaction.  ] that is not limited to undue influence cases. over the course of the last century the high court has made observations about and applied the principles in relation to a trial judge’s findings of fact. those high court decisions include mclaughlin v daily telegraph newspaper co ltd (no 2) [1904] hca 51, dearman v dearman [1908] hca 84, scott v pauly [1917] hca 60, paterson v paterson [1953] hca 74, voulis v kozary [1975] hca 44, warren v coombes [1979] hca 9, brunskill v sovereign marine & general insurance co ltd (1985) 59 aljr 84, abalos v australian postal commission [1990] hca 47, devries v australian national railways commission (1993) 177 clr 472, 479-481, state rail authority of new south wales v earthline constructions pty ltd [1999] hca 3, walsh v law society of new south wales [1999] hca 33, rosenberg v percival [2001] hca 18, fox v percy [2003] hca 22, csr ltd v della maddalena [2006] hca 1, miller & associates insurance broking pty ltd v bmw australia finance ltd [2010] hca 31, minister for immigration and border protection v szvfw [2018] hca 30 and lee v lee [2019] hca 28. [87] deane j also explained in louth v diprose [1992] hca 61 that where an intermediate appellate court has agreed with the findings of fact made by the trial judge, even the high court should not disturb those concurrent findings in the absence of special reasons such as plain injustice or clear error. so much was held in the commonwealth v introvigne [1982] hca 40, south australia v johnson (1982) 42 alr 161, waltons stores (interstate) ltd v maher (1988) 164 clr 387 and walker v wilson [1991] hca 8. of special relevance are the comments of deane j in waltons stores about the rationale and justification for such an approach. it was as follows –  ] deane j also explained in louth v diprose [1992] hca 61 that where an intermediate appellate court has agreed with the findings of fact made by the trial judge, even the high court should not disturb those concurrent findings in the absence of special reasons such as plain injustice or clear error. so much was held in the commonwealth v introvigne [1982] hca 40, south australia v johnson (1982) 42 alr 161, waltons stores (interstate) ltd v maher (1988) 164 clr 387 and walker v wilson [1991] hca 8. of special relevance are the comments of deane j in waltons stores about the rationale and justification for such an approach. it was as follows –
in a context where the cost of litigation has gone a long way towards effectively denying access to the courts to the ordinary citizen who lacks access to government or corporate funding, it is in the overall interests of the administration of justice and of the preservation of at least some vestige of practical equality before the law that, in the absence of special circumstances, there should be an end to the litigation of an issue of fact at least when the stage is reached that one party has succeeded upon it both on the hearing before the court of first instance and on a rehearing before the court of first appeal.  ] the plurality (dawson, gaudron & mchugh jj) expressed matters slightly differently but to like effect. their honours held as follows –
the assessment of character is part of the process involved in determining questions of credit, although, as here, there may be cases in which character assumes a significance of its own. the process of accepting or rejecting evidence has been described as one that involves an inference based, at least in part, on “a principle of faith in human veracity sanctioned by experience” (j. h. wigmore, wigmore on evidence, vol. ia (tillers ed, 1983) p. 954, referring to an unverified citation from t. starkie, law of evidence, (1824). see also doney v the queen [1990] hca 51, (1990) 171 clr 207, 214). likewise, the assessment of character, which is often an earlier step in the process of determining issues of credit, may be described as involving an inference based, at least in part, on a principle of faith in human conduct sanctioned by experience. in both cases, the process is one in which the decision maker brings to bear his or her experience of life and, perhaps, his or her personal predilections. because of this, different people may come to different conclusions about character and credit and, hence, as to disputed matters of fact. it is precisely because different people may come to different conclusions as to character, credit and disputed matters of fact that, in a forensic contest, findings as to those matters are entrusted to the trial judge (or, in cases of trial by jury, to the jury) in accordance with rules and procedures that guarantee a considerable measure of finality. and in a forensic contest, findings as to those matters will usually be bound up with each other and involve some consideration of demeanour in the witness box - as they did in this case.  ] the plurality also mentioned the relevance of demeanour. it was as follows –
they are findings which were substantially dependent on the trial judge's assessment of character and credit and which were reached having regard to the demeanour of the parties in the witness box. as such and as the authorities repeatedly acknowledge, they are findings which, unless some error is to be discerned, an appeal court must respect (paterson v paterson [1953] hca 74, (1953) 89 clr 212, 218-224, taylor v johnson [1983] hca 5, (1983) 151 clr 422, 441-443, brunskill v sovereign marine & general insurance co ltd [1985] hca 61, (1985) 59 aljr 842, 844, baumgartner v baumgartner [1987] hca 59, (1987) 164 clr 137, 144-146, abalos v australian postal commission [1990] hca 47, (1990) 171 clr 167, 178-179, dawson v. westpac banking corporation [1991] hca 52, (1991) 66 aljr 94, 99, 105, wilton v farnworth [1948] hca 20, (1948) 76 clr 646, 654-655, blomley v ryan [1956] hca 81, (1956) 99 clr 362, 409).  ] making findings of fact in a case such as this imposes an enormous responsibility on the trial judge. i have approached the task diligently focused on the requirements set out above. [91] before addressing specific issues raised by disputed evidence and expressing my evaluation of whose evidence on a given point i found to be more reliable, it is useful to record a few observations about the presentation of the applicant and the respondent. [92] it was possible for me to state certain observations about each of the applicant and the respondent. so far as the respondent was concerned, i formed the view that he was guarded and less than fully frank in his evidence. the version of events given in his affidavit was selective. he did not put key issues into their full chronological context. in the witness box his answers to questions put during cross examination were clipt [sic]. in most instances he said no more than was absolutely necessary to provide a responsive answer to the questions put. in saying that i recognise that the respondent was, most likely, a hard-headed business man whose ordinary demeanour was cool and calculating. even so, in my judgment the respondent did not tell me all material information within the witness’s knowledge for which the answers to questions put to him called. [93] conversely, the applicant often told me more than she was asked. i do not mean by that observation that she was wholly unfocused or unrestrained in the information she gave. however, at times she was unresponsive to questions put to her, preferring instead to volunteer more than she was asked. yet that did not detract from the value of the responsive answers that she gave. at times she was pressed (although i must say with perfect propriety by mr sansom sc) in her evidence and, for the most part, she was firm in her response. her evidence of her abortion was undoubtedly difficult for her to give as no doubt was her evidence about her lengthy devotion to a man who was cool and unresponsive to her at an emotional level. while the applicant tended to be scattered at times, i took the view she was thoroughly honest. i took the view the respondent kept a significant amount of evidence from me.  ] before addressing specific issues raised by disputed evidence and expressing my evaluation of whose evidence on a given point i found to be more reliable, it is useful to record a few observations about the presentation of the applicant and the respondent.

... witnesses are supposed to answer questions put by counsel responsively: they are supposed to give a full answer, but no more. it is one thing to say that a witness was not asked the right questions. it is another thing to say that a witness did not answer the questions that were asked. and it is an even more serious thing to say that a witness was “reluctant” to answer. the duty of a witness is to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so far as the questions asked seek it. the duty of a witness to answer questions responsively involves not only a negative duty (not to volunteer material for which the question does not call), but also a positive duty (to proffer all material within the witness’s knowledge for which the question does call). to conclude that a party-witness is reluctant to say what happened is to conclude that the party-witness is deliberately failing to comply with the duty to tell the whole truth. that is a serious conclusion to reach, for the following reasons.[64]   witnesses are expected to answer questions put to them, (b) witnesses are expected to give answers that are truthful, (c) witnesses are expected to proffer “all material within the witness’s knowledge for which the question does call”, and (d) witnesses are expected “not to volunteer material for which the question does not call”.   witnesses are expected to give answers that are truthful, (c) witnesses are expected to proffer “all material within the witness’s knowledge for which the question does call”, and (d) witnesses are expected “not to volunteer material for which the question does not call”.   witnesses are expected to proffer “all material within the witness’s knowledge for which the question does call”, and (d) witnesses are expected “not to volunteer material for which the question does not call”.   witnesses are expected “not to volunteer material for which the question does not call”.
... the express reference to a person’s ‘ability to observe or remember facts and events’ can only be a reference to reliability. in short, ‘credibility’ imports notions of both truthfulness and reliability ...[65]
the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them ] ...questions between husband and wife about the ownership of property that may be then, or may have been in the past, enjoying common are to be “decided according to the same scheme of legal titles and equitable principles as govern the rights of any to persons who are not spouses” [hepworth v hepworth (1963) 110 clr 309]. the question presented by s 79 is whether those rights and interests should be altered.[67]

according to page 13 of the husband's 24 february 2021 affidavit, [n law firm] received $49,760 and [rr law firm] lawyers received $25,205 from the proceeds of sale [of the [town f] property]. this is a total of $74,965. the husband concedes it is appropriate this amount be added back since otherwise the wife would inadvertently be contributing to the husband's legal fees without a section 117 order.
