the husband dates these initial contributions from about the time of the parties’ marriage in 2004. i have found that the parties’ commenced cohabitation no later than 1999 and that the parties were separated for a period of one year prior to their marriage, and therefore some part of the husband’s asserted savings as at 2004 may reasonably be taken to have accumulated during the preceding three and a half years of cohabitation.   $407,021 from his savings at the time of purchase, (b) $36,000 from the wife’s savings at the time of purchase, (c) $7,000 as received from the government as a first home owners grant, and (d) $455,000 in joint borrowing on the loan account with anz bank.   $36,000 from the wife’s savings at the time of purchase, (c) $7,000 as received from the government as a first home owners grant, and (d) $455,000 in joint borrowing on the loan account with anz bank.   $7,000 as received from the government as a first home owners grant, and (d) $455,000 in joint borrowing on the loan account with anz bank.   $455,000 in joint borrowing on the loan account with anz bank.  7] i initiated separation in the form of living together under one roof in 2012.[2] [138] after we separated in january 2012, we lived together under the same roof and attempted to put our unresolved differences aside and reconcile.[3] [150] during our separation and up until [mr wade] left the marital home in august 2016, i continued to be the primary carer of the children.[4]  8] after we separated in january 2012, we lived together under the same roof and attempted to put our unresolved differences aside and reconcile.[3] [150] during our separation and up until [mr wade] left the marital home in august 2016, i continued to be the primary carer of the children.[4]  0] during our separation and up until [mr wade] left the marital home in august 2016, i continued to be the primary carer of the children.[4]

the law  the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in property, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, (b) the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (c) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[10]   the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (c) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[10]   the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[10]
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[12]   first, “the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities, and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing”,[14]   second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [15] (c) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[16] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[17]   third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[16] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[17]   fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[17]
... indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis (1986) 161 clr 513).[20]  ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial “product” or “value”. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent “causal connection” might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the “...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...” or, indeed, to “property” at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to:  ] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c).

... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse’s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[23]
...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.[25]
as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.[26]
the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them ] ...questions between husband and wife about the ownership of property that may be then, or may have been in the past, enjoying common are to be “decided according to the same scheme of legal titles and equitable principles as govern the rights of any to persons who are not spouses” [hepworth v hepworth (1963) 110 clr 309]. the question presented by s 79 is whether those rights and interests should be altered.[27]

is it just and equitable in all the circumstances to make an order under section 79 altering the interests of the parties in the property?
assessment of contributions.  the husband made the significant initial contribution, (b) the contributions of the parties during cohabitation were equal, (c) the contributions of the parties during their period of separation under the same roof were equal, (d) the contributions of the parties from august 2016 until january 2021 were equal, and (e) the wife made the greater contribution from january 2021 until the hearing.   the contributions of the parties during cohabitation were equal, (c) the contributions of the parties during their period of separation under the same roof were equal, (d) the contributions of the parties from august 2016 until january 2021 were equal, and (e) the wife made the greater contribution from january 2021 until the hearing.   the contributions of the parties during their period of separation under the same roof were equal, (d) the contributions of the parties from august 2016 until january 2021 were equal, and (e) the wife made the greater contribution from january 2021 until the hearing.   the contributions of the parties from august 2016 until january 2021 were equal, and (e) the wife made the greater contribution from january 2021 until the hearing.   the wife made the greater contribution from january 2021 until the hearing.
should there be any adjustment between the parties in consequence of matters referred to in section 79(4)(d) to (g) of the act?
conclusion
nevertheless it is true to say that it is unsatisfactory in the general context of the philosophy of the family law act for a really significant issue between parties who are divorced and have gone their separate ways to remain in suspended animation for a number of years.[29]
