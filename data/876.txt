part i – the parenting proceedingsrelevant findings of fact:
the parties
pre-relationship
early relationship
cohabitation
whilst living with [ms jurak]i learnt that she was not sporty or academic. [ms jurak] struggled playing easy levels of [game v] (an app on a smart phone). she took far longer than expected for an adult to unjumble words. i was shocked why she couldn’t see that enrolling for “[her occupation]” was a bad idea. [ms jurak] also played [sports] in our mixed social team through [the husband’s then-employer]. [ms jurak] never developed [sports] skills...[4] i consider myself the opposite to [ms jurak] both academically and with sports - i studied [subjects] at school before completing two degrees. [ms jurak] said to me on several occasions, “you’re one of the smartest people i know.” [5] we would argue. she would concede eventually that she was wrong but it was exhausting to get through to her and get her to admit it, she wouldn’t apologise. she is a very poor problem solver, lacks intelligence, i was always having to take charge, i had to. i planned our entire wedding. all her ideas were “shit”. what man has to do that? [6]
it appears his emotional reactivity and his aggressive response to this is increasing, which led to some confrontations with the public, friends and staff in a bar last night.
suffered from depression and anxiety but also he seemed to suffer regularly from what i can only describe as episodes of explosive rage. it is difficult to say what triggered these – imagined slights from work colleagues, difficulties with clients, workload – but he would storm around the house during the night and i would have to wake and calm him. i would make him chamomile tea and generally support him through this. looking back now i realize i was often placating [mr jurak] and ignoring what should have been warning signs. [9]   jurak] was a constant barrier to the purchase of the [business] due to her lack of understanding and controlling nature. [ms jurak] was truly out of her depth with this business. this did not change throughout ownership. [11]
x  jurak] was furious, put [x] on the bed and pushed past me, screaming at me that [x] wouldn’t stop crying. i saw that he had knocked over the picture frames on the tallboy. [mr jurak] admitted to kicking the bassinet, throwing the dummy and punching other furniture while holding the baby before i entered the room. [mr jurak] then stormed off yelling ‘fuck’, ‘fuck!’ and slammed every door closed between the nursery and the bedroom including the kitchen sliding door. [12]
leadup to separation
not bad for a woman who was apparently scared of me and had just put out an advo on me for “domestic violence”. [19]
i settled him and we went back to sleep until 5am. he would not go back to sleep, so i played with him on his play mat until 7.30am when [ms jurak] woke up. she had a full night’s sleep and when she came out into the loungeroom she looked like absolute crap – again, tired and cranky, even though i had been the one with the bad night’s sleep. this was always how it was – whether [ms jurak] slept well or not, she simply was not coping with the responsibility of a newborn. [20]
by declaring insomnia, [ms jurak] was absent fault. insomnia had nothing to do with [ms jurak] seeing a psychologist – [ms jurak] simply could not admit that her anxiety, depression and mood were out of her control. presenting this appearance of “superiority” was a common feature of [ms jurak]’s personality. i had seen it for years. [21]
post-separation parenting arrangements
the final breakdown
very external locus of control about controlling temper – “other people can control it but i can’t, i just snap” very fixed on his sense of injustice doesn’t feel the legal system is working for him, feels he has to “get justice for himself” stated over and over that he feels it is inevitable that he is going to murder [ms jurak], and that is the only way to get justice, and that will be fine because then he’ll be in jail with “people like him” these statements were said during outburst however, and when challenged once more calm, [mr jurak] doesn’t continue to state they are true doesn’t have any active plan to harm himself or anyone else after repeated threats, yelling and shouting, [mr jurak] was able to say that he had no plans to have any contact with [ms jurak], and will not seek her out had a significant loss of temper in my room today yelling, punching himself, formed up to punch his dad but stopped trial of increase escitalopram prn diazepam for worst of anger/rage [26]
“it’s like my mood is too overwhelming and consumes me in a way that control my thinking.” “we spoke at length about my thoughts of suicide and killing others. i think we agree i have a mental health condition because i can change so quickly and react way more than most people would.” “i told mum and dad that i’m going to end up in jail. my hatred for [ms jurak] and her family is just too strong and when i’m in that state nothing is going to stop me.” “so anyways i had a double dose of my meds last night wanting to kill myself, or her, again.” “i just hate her so much. i wish she was dead.”
it is clear the poi [the husband] has displayed hatred and the want to harm the victim. his demeanour and mental state is the most concerning factor as it is clear that even though he is seeking treatment, he is unable to control or manage these urges to harm himself or others. police will be making application to vary the current provisional order [avo].
he expressed also homicidal ideation’s [sic] towards his partner again and was informed that these comments have consequences like the more restrictive avo. he said this is just to show how frustrated he is “to what a level it has come.” he feels by making these statements that others he makes the statements towards can understand how desperate he is. it was difficult for him to acknowledge that these statements scare others and that they have to protect themself [sic] [28]   emphasis)
wife & x return to town e / husband has no contact with x
wife relocates with x
“keep up the good work and encourage more women not to let their children see their father. there is a special place in hell for people like you”. [32]
“i would like you to rephrase that in a respectful manner. it was a direct debit so she didn’t withdraw it. the bank did so maybe you need to get onto them eh? perhaps you could use the same disdainful tone. frankly i don’t think i need to do anything because [ms jurak], as honest and decent as she is, will take steps to do it herself. nevertheless i will forward your message.”
“shove respect up your arse. you assist women keeping children from fathers and therefore deserve to be treated accordingly. [ms jurak] is the least honest and most indecent woman i have ever met. you aren’t any better.” [35]   jurak] and [ms ah], you are both lying, thieving, manipulative disgusting, cowards. the bullying and selfishness you have both displayed is pathological. you both deserve to spend time in jail for what you have done. [37]
supervised time
q: when you were together with the other parents, how would you describe what it was like to live with them/live with you? --- draining. she is not a very smart person. she is not domestic. cooking and cleaning are not her strong points. she came to the relationship with no assets and not a good job. i had the main financial responsibility and pressures of responsibilities at home and with the businesses. she has no problem solving skills. [38]   jurak] said he was going to say something and it was up to me if i pretend the conversation didn’t happen or what i do with it. [mr jurak] paused and said he wants to take [x] down to the river to set up a picnic and spend some time with [x] down by the water. i spoke to [mr jurak] and explained there is a process that we need to follow and an assessment before offsite visits or visits outside of the centre can take place. i told [mr jurak] both parents will have to be part of that process... [mr jurak] said that he was not asking but was telling me that this is what he would be doing on friday and he understands that puts us in a difficult situation. [mr jurak] said that he feels like his only hope is to bring [x] home to [town d] to get in front of a judge and have them listen to him. i asked [mr jurak] if that was his intention on friday to ‘bring [x] home?’ [mr jurak] said no that was not his intention he is only highlighting his desperation at this point. [mr jurak] confirmed his intention was not taking [x] anywhere but down to the river for a picnic for the 2 hours of their visit. i spoke to [mr jurak] and asked if the visit is to take place in the centre this coming friday 21st without our okay to take [x] to the river would he still do so? [mr jurak] replied and said, ‘i cannot answer that.’ i let [mr jurak] know that i will follow up what i need to and have a further conversation with him regarding the visit on friday. [mr jurak] thanked me and the call ended.   jurak] said he runs businesses and knows for a fact it’s not hard, however everyone around him keeps making everything fucking hard and [mr jurak] keeps being a fucking cunt. [mr jurak] said multiple times, ‘it’s not that fucking hard’ and again said he is sick of all the bullshit he is being put through and he should be able to do these things with [x]. i asked [mr jurak] to please not speak that way. [mr jurak] was silent and apologised and said, ‘i will stay in the fucking centre. [mr jurak] asked, is that what you need? and said again i will stay in the centre, he asked what else he needed to do. i let [mr jurak] know i have spoken to my manager regarding the visit on friday and we will not be scheduling the visit. [mr jurak] said he does not care what the manager said and he has not seen [x] for 5 weeks and prior to visits commencing it had been 8 months. [mr jurak] said he would speak to the manager about it and i advised [mr jurak] i will ask her to call him.   jurak] said that if the mother could do this he didn’t see anything wrong with doing it too and bringing his son [x] home. i asked [mr jurak] what impact he felt doing this would have on his son [x]. [mr jurak] said no harm would come from his son being at home where he belonged. i asked what he thought might happen if he was to leave from the visit at [town r] and take his [x] home, he said no-one cared when his son’s fucking mother abducted him. he said he didn’t care that he would probably be fucking arrested and at least get before a judge to tell his story. i explained to [mr jurak] that i know the court would not view this favourably for unsupervised time in the future and i believe that taking matters into his own hands, ie. being arrested in front of [x] is also detrimental to [x]’s mental/emotional wellbeing and safety. at times during the call [mr jurak] degraded his ex, calling her names i explained this is concerning and explained that this practice is viewed as harmful for children, given children are made up from both of their parents. [mr jurak] spoke about believing no one is listening to him, and the court making decisions to suit mum. he said he thinks the court will again rule in her favour and that’s why he feels desperate... i explained that while worker has explained that the actual visits are going well and have had no concerns about the visits, i said i do have concerns about the communication he has displayed when talking about his ex to staff, his conversation with worker about not following staff directions re visits and raising his voice at and swearing at staff. i explained i need to determine if the visit is safe to go ahead. he said i have told worker and i will tell you all that i will stay at centre. i said i understand this but then i hear him say he cannot see any concerns for his son if he was to take his son home... [mr jurak] was heightened and the conversation was going around in circles. i suggested we end the conversation, and i will look at everything discussed today and get back to him.   jurak] said i told you i will fucking stay at the centre this week. i said i know you said this after the remarks about not staying at centre however we need to consider the safety of the child. [mr jurak] cut me off and loudly said so on one hand you are saying you want to help and the other hand you are saying i can’t see my son this saturday, you know what you can go fuck yourself and he hung up.
as for visitation, until [ms jurak] agrees to return [x] to [town e] permanently, and my time with [x] changes to unsupervised and i am give a significant increase in hours as requested in my response affidavit, all visits are to cease. [x], myself and the rest of the family deserve nothing less.

“there was something about [ms ad’s] arrogance and level of self importance that i did not realise until it was too late, referring to the fact that she reported me to police for “threats to kill” only after i tried to hang myself [in] 2021.” [42]

this lessor is the same, the figure is remarkably close to $4,000 per month given the timing of when the lease was taken out (around 6 months earlier). moreover, the company ar expenses only start in the fy 2022 table, consistent with it being the lease in question there is no allowance for company ar expenses in the fy 2021, 2020 or 2019 tables which are also contained at page 18 of the report.
