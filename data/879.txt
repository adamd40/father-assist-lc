[x] shall spend time and communicate with the mother as follows: from 3pm friday until 3pm sunday at the end of the 1st, 4th, and 7th week of each school term, for up to 24 hours in sydney during school terms if the mother is able to travel to sydney providing she makes sure [x] attends school or any pre-arranged activity or commitment. she shall advise the father at least 3 days in advance of her intention to exercise such time, the father shall not unreasonably refuse. the mother shall not use such time to include the whole of [x]’s birthday. from 3pm on the final day of each of terms 1 and 3 until 3pm on the middle saturday of the holidays. from 3pm on the final day of terms 2 until 3pm on the sunday before school resumes. for one half of the term 4 school holidays each year at times agreed between the parents to include christmas day in odd numbered years but excluding christmas day in even numbered years. by video call each tuesday and thursday at 6:30pm with the parents not to engage with each other beyond general greetings during [x]’s calls. the mother shall initiate the call. the call shall conclude when [x] is ready but shall not extend beyond 15 minutes. handovers the mother shall collect [x] from school if applicable, and otherwise from the father’s home in sydney at the commencement of her time with [x] unless otherwise agreed. the mother may, if necessary, arrange a third party to collect [x] providing that person is known to [x] and the father. the father shall collect [x] from the mother’s home in [city j] at the conclusion of the mother’s time unless otherwise agreed. the father may, if necessary, arrange a third party to deliver [x] providing that person is known to [x] and the mother. special occasions the parent who has the care of [x] on any special occasions such as christmas, mother’s day, father’s day, or the birthday of a parent, step-parent, sibling, or [x] himself, shall ensure x is assisted to make or receive a video call with the relevant person on the day. restraints the parents are restrained from yelling or swearing at each other, or each other’s partners, in the presence or hearing of [x] and from allowing any other person to do so. the parents shall not say rude, unkind, or negative things about the other parent to, or in front of, [x].
some particular matters of evidence  there is no question that x remains in a close, loving relationship with both of his parents. this is so even after having lived with his father and ms c for a not insignificant time. if there was anything untoward arising from x living in the same household as ms c, apart from a verbal altercation between the mother and ms c a number of christmases ago, one might reasonably have expected someone (notably the mother) to have raised it in her material well before the trial, (b) whatever the poor advice given to the father to the effect that ms c was really not required to put on any evidence in support of the father’s case (assuming that such inept advice was in fact given), ultimately the court is required to make orders that are in the child’s best interests. provided the absence of ms c’s evidence does not adversely impact upon making such orders for x’s benefit, which appears quite clearly to be the case, in my view, the adverse inference that may otherwise be drawn pursuant to the principles in jones v dunkel, need not occur or be taken, (c) presumably, too, both the mother, and the court, may take it that, absent any evidence to the contrary (and there is none), the father would not consciously put x at any relevant risk, such as living with a person who, for example, might have a deleterious impact upon the child. there is no suggestion in any of the material that ms c poses any risk to the child or otherwise does not assist the father in the care and welfare of x, (d) the court may also be comforted by the father’s evidence that he plans to have children with ms c, whether she knows about this intention or not at the moment is not immediately relevant.[6] the reasonable inference, i suggest, is that the father would not be contemplating, let alone announcing to the court, his plan to have children to someone who might not be a good and reliable mother, not only of x, but also of children to appear sometime in the not too distant future – one might reasonably assume.   whatever the poor advice given to the father to the effect that ms c was really not required to put on any evidence in support of the

[ms c] described a positive and respectful relationship with [mr riordan], with no significant conflict. she spoke positively about her relationship with [x], identifying that they enjoy [crafts] together. she said that she does need to 'discipline' [x], as he listens well when in her care. she explained that [ms janco] has asked that [ms c] is not involved in discipline practices for [x], so if she is concerned about [x]’s behaviour, she will suggest to [mr riordan] that [x] goes to his room for five minutes. [ms c] reported that [x] does not often speak about his mother with her, but said she responds positively if he mentions her. she added that she thinks [x] was aware that there was tension between her and [ms janco], but that she thinks [x]’s understanding has changed recently. she said that [x] had made a comment about his mother, and [ms c] asked him, "did that happen? shall i call mum and check?" she said that [x] seemed surprised that [ms c] had his mother telephone number, and that they could speak with one another. [ms c] believes that [x] generally enjoys his time with his mother, and believes the current arrangement is working well. she said that she has concerns about [mr e], describing him as "very violent". she alleged that, recently, [mr e] had told [x] about breaking his hand by punching a wall, which she does not believe was appropriate for [x] to hear. additionally, she raised concerns about [ms janco]'s decision-making, giving an example of her telling [x] that they could take a dog for a walk, after the dog had previously attacked [ms janco].
the parties’ evidence
the report of ms d  entered the observation room happily with his mother, who had brought age appropriate toys with which [x] could play. [x] initially challenged his mother, making comments such as, "i told you to do it stop lying" and, "you have to make the whole thing by yourself', but soon agreed to help make the lego set with his mother. he frequently turned to his mother for advice and assistance, while she supported him to create the lego set. [x]was noticeably breathing through his mouth throughout the observation sessions, and held his breath at times while concentrating. [x]remained focused on the lego build for 30 minutes, and seemed happy for his mother to assist him. [ms janco] complimented him regularly during the observation, praising his building abilities. at the end of the observation session, [ms janco] suggested that [x] could complete the lego task with his father, but [x] said that he wanted to finish it with his mother. [ms janco] then assisted [x] to complete the build quickly, and asked [x] for a kiss before he left. [x] gave his mother a kiss, and entered the observation room cheerfully with his father. [x] interacted comfortably with his father, and requested assistance when needed. [mr riordan] frequently encouraged [x] to demonstrate his skills and tell the assessor about his experiences, asking [x] whether he had told the assessor about visiting the dinosaur museum, asking him mathematical questions, and asking him to write '[his surname]’ on a piece of paper, [mr riordan] praised [x] regularly, and provided appropriate guidance, such as telling him to face the 'nerf gun' away from the assessor, and reminding [x] not to throw crayons. at the end of the observation session, [mr riordan] asked [x] to assist in tidying the toys, and told [x] that he would need to have a nap or miss out on playing 'roblox' if he did not help. the parents interacted amicably after the observation sessions, and left the registry together.
based on [x]’s age and stage of development, the priorities for him will be to have: a safe and stable home environment, warm, emotionally sensitive relationships with his caregivers, a meaningful relationship with each of his parents, and a child-focused routine with opportunities to engage in early learning. as an aboriginal child, it will also be important for [x] to have opportunities to connect with his cultural identity. [x]’s parents have had ongoing disagreements about [x]’s medical needs, with [ms janco] believing that [x]’s breathing difficulties are due to asthma, and [mr riordan] believing the issues are due to [his medical condition]. this disagreement appears to have been driven by a lack of effective communication between the parents, and a mistrust of the health professionals by both parents. it appears that, at times, [x]’s health has been placed at risk by this disagreement, such as [ms janco] reporting that she could not provide [x] with ventolin, even when advised to do so, and [mr riordan] reporting that [x]’s surgery has been delayed. [mr riordan] has alleged that [ms janco] has given [x] non-prescribed medication, though [ms janco] reported that this was a misunderstanding. [ms janco] believes [mr riordan] has not complied with giving [x] his medication, which [mr riordan] denies. this lack of trust, and potential noncompliance with medical advice will make it difficult for [x]’s medical team to provide quality assessment and medical care for him. an additional difficulty appears to have been conflict during or following medical appointments, which also has the capacity to interfere with the medical care [x] receives, as well as adding an additional element of distress for [x]. due to the mistrust between the parents, both parents have had instances where they have withheld [x] from the other parent, claiming they are concerned about the other parents' capacity to meet [x]’s needs. this has led to significant disruptions in [x]’s routines and relationships with each of his parents. it will be vital that, into the future, [x] has a stable routine in which he can maintain his expectations of when he will spend time with each parent. this will be particularly important once [x] begins primary school. both parents may benefit from engaging in an attachment-based parenting program, such as the [b program], to better understand [x]’s emotional and relationship needs. [ms janco] believes that she is more available for [x], physically and emotionally. she also believes that she is better positioned to maintain x's relationships with his extended family, who mostly reside in [city j]. however, significant concerns have been raised by [mr riordan] about [ms janco]'s capacity to provide stability and appropriate care for [x]. [mr riordan] acknowledged that [x] enjoys spending time with his mother, but believes [ms janco] does not manage his behaviour appropriately. [ms janco] did not indicate that she has issues managing [x]’s behaviour, but did state that [x] displays inappropriate behaviours with her, which [mr riordan] reports do not occur in his care. during the observation session, both parents appeared to guide [x]’s behaviour appropriately. [mr riordan] also raised concerns about [ms janco]'s emotional regulation, alleging that he frequently yelled at him during the relationship and during handovers. [ms janco] aclalowledged that she had yelled at, and threatened, [ms c], in front of [x]. it appears that, at times, [ms janco] has struggled to regulate her emotions when frustrated, which has exposed [x] to high levels of conflict. these difficulties could have been exacerbated by untreated adhd and possibly ptsd. since these incidents, [ms janco] has sought assessment and treatment for her mental health, which will hopefully mean increased emotional stability. it will be important for [ms janco] to maintain her mental health through ongoing supports and monitoring. [x] appears settled in his father's care, and has spent the majority of weekday time with his father over the past two years. [ms janco] is concerned about [mr riordan’s] availability, but it appears he has structured his work hours to ensure he has time to spend with [x]. [mr riordan] also indicated that he has explored opportunities for [x] to connect with his aboriginal culture through the local school, and can also assist [x]'s cultural connections through his extended family members. [ms janco] is concerned that [mr riordan] does not offer the same emotional support that she does, and that he does not allow [x] to express himself. the parents appear to have different parenting approaches. while it will be important for [ms janco] to learn to maintain clear behavioural boundaries with [x], it will also be important for [mr riordan] to support [x]’s emotions and self-expression. the parents will also benefit from accepting some differences in their parenting approaches, and recognising that they support [x]’s needs in complementary ways. the parents reported that their communication and co-parenting dynamic has fluctuated since their separation, but is currently reasonably effective. as the parents have both had significant involvement throughout [x]’s life, and both contribute to his wellbeing in complementary ways, it would be beneficial for the parents to share parental responsibility for [x]. however, both parents acknowledged that they have not been able to collaborate to make decisions about [x]’s medical care, which has negatively affected [x]’s health. the court may wish to consider ordering that only one parent holds parental responsibility for [x]’s medical needs, to ensure [x] receives timely and appropriate medical care into the future. both parents appear to have contributed to addressing [x]’s medical needs, as well as to hindering his medical care through their disagreement. however, if only one parent holds responsibility for [x]’s medical decisions, practically it makes sense that this should be the parent, with whom [x] primarily lives. [ms janco] believes that it is in [x]’s best interests to return to live with her in [city j], due to her increased availability, and her belief that she can best meet [x]’s emotional needs. [mr riordan] believes that [x] is settled in his current home and routine, and that he is best placed to provide quality day-to-day care to [x]. due to the distance between the homes, [x] will need to reside primarily with one parent, and spend weekend and school holiday time with the other parent. on balance, it seems to be least disruptive for him to remain living primarily with his father, who appears well placed to meet [x]’s physical, emotional, educational and cultural needs. [x] will benefit from regular time with his mother, as frequently as is practical due to the distances between the homes. the current arrangement of spending alternate weekends appears manageable, and could increase to include longer periods during school holidays. it will be important that there is also scheduled facetime contact between [x] and his mother, and that the parents ensure that [x] is not exposed to hostility between [x]’s caregivers during these calls.
