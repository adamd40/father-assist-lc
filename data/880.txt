background
application of the slip rule
some accidental slips or omissions are capable of correction at common law[2]. this facility is now commonly replaced by provisions in rules of court. in the family court of australia that is where the “slip rule” may be found. ordinarily it is limited to correction of the formal record for accidental mistakes or omissions of no substantive consequence. similarly when it can be shown that a court order does not correctly reflect the court’s decisions as contained in its reasons rectification of the order is viewed as nothing more than a mechanical task. where, without alteration it is possible to repair an oversight and prevent injustice by making a supplementary order, the existence of a previously perfected order will be no barrier.
