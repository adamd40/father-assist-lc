submissions
relevant legal principles
in hearne v street [2008] hca 36, (2008) 235 clr 125 at 154 the high court said the following in relation to the nature of the “implied undertaking”, arising out of the harman decision:
where one party to litigation is compelled, either by reason of a rule of court, or by reason of a specific order of the court, or otherwise, to disclose documents or information, the party obtaining the disclosure cannot, without the leave of the court, use it for any purpose other than that for which it was given unless it is received into evidence. the types of material disclosed to which this principle applies include documents inspected after discovery, answers to interrogatories, documents produced on subpoena, documents produced for the purposes of taxation of costs, documents produced pursuant to a direction from an arbitrator, documents seized pursuant to an anton piller order, witness statements served pursuant to a judicial direction and affidavits.
the rationale of the principle is the public interest in protecting the privacy of the person compelled to produce documents via a court’s coercive powers. parties are ‘privileged’ to be in a possession of another litigant’s documents.[1] the impact of breaching the implied undertaking can be serious. a party who attempts to use material to which the undertaking attaches without first obtaining the leave of a court will be guilty of contempt. a proceeding commenced on the basis of information obtained in breach of the undertaking is liable to be struck out.[2] an injunction may also be issued to restrain the use of documents in breach of the implied undertaking.[3] there are exceptions to the ‘rule’ including where the documents evidence a fraud or a crime and where it is in the public interest.[4] another exception is where the document is read in open court or formally entered into evidence.[5] this is consistent with the principle of open courts. some courts have express rules governing the undertaking. for the court, the rule is partially codified in r 6.04 of the federal circuit court and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 (cth). that rule is as follows: (1) a person who inspects or copies a document, in relation to a proceeding, under these rules or an order:   must use the document for the purpose of the proceeding only, and (b) must not otherwise disclose the contents of the document, or give a copy of it, to any other person without the court's permission.   must not otherwise disclose the contents of the document, or give a copy of it, to any other person without the court's permission.   however: (a) a solicitor may disclose the contents of the document or give a copy of the document to the solicitor's client or counsel, and (b) a client may disclose the contents of the document or give a copy of the document to the client's solicitor or counsel, and (c) this rule does not affect the right of a party to use a document or to disclose its contents if that party has a common interest in the document with the party who has possession or control of the document. the relevant test for leave is the establishment of ‘special circumstances’. the leading authority on the subject is springfield nominees pty ltd v bridgelands securities (1992) 38 fcr 217 at [225] in which wilcox j held:   a solicitor may disclose the contents of the document or give a copy of the document to the solicitor's client or counsel, and (b) a client may disclose the contents of the document or give a copy of the document to the client's solicitor or counsel, and (c) this rule does not affect the right of a party to use a document or to disclose its contents if that party has a common interest in the document with the party who has possession or control of the document.   a client may disclose the contents of the document or give a copy of the document to the client's solicitor or counsel, and (c) this rule does not affect the right of a party to use a document or to disclose its contents if that party has a common interest in the document with the party who has possession or control of the document.   this rule does not affect the right of a party to use a document or to disclose its contents if that party has a common interest in the document with the party who has possession or control of the document.
for "special circumstances" to exist it is enough that there is a special feature of the case which affords a reason for modifying or releasing the undertaking and is not usually present. the matter then becomes one of the proper exercise of the court’s discretion, many factors being relevant. it is neither possible nor desirable to propound an exhaustive list of those factors. but plainly they include the nature of the document, the circumstances under which it came into existence, the attitude of the author of the document and any prejudice the author may sustain, whether the document pre-existed litigation or was created for that purpose and therefore expected to enter the public domain, the nature of the information in the document (in particular whether it contains personal data or commercially sensitive information), the circumstances in which the document came into the hands of the applicant for leave and, perhaps most important of all, the likely contribution of the document to achieving justice in the second proceeding.
the discretion is a broad one and all the circumstances of the case must be examined.[6]
