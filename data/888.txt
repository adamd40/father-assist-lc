as far as i know most of the highly valued items you sent to india with your mother during her trips since we both had major security concerns here. the leftover items whatever you kept here for your usage are untouched and should be there wherever you kept them. they will be accessed only with your presence in front of an [sic] witness.  ’s jewellery is here, it wasn’t sent to india. the bangles ring and chain they gifted her is in the box with jewellery from your family. the chain your mother gave will be there, i remember. the silver [jewellery] [ms p] gave and gold bracelet not chain that [ms o] gave were more recent and there as well... my jewellery, some rings, bangles which was a gift to me from my parents after [x] was born, some pearls and a box with earnings [sic] are the ones i purchase from my income that i have here.
gold is not something that is easily just carried over the border, mr maddox. if there was any gold sent over, it would be taxed very heavily. even if you take 5 grams of gold it’s something that has to be declared. it would be at a very expensive cost to me - it may be something i would consider if i was leaving the country and moving eventually. but no gold that is mine or my daughters has ever been sent overseas.

whether an order altering property interests should be made
the assessment of contributions
put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79.
the husband raising his voice
the wife’s relocation to australia
coercive and controlling behaviour
i was not allowed to socialise and the respondent only had two friends he introduced me to. it was therefore difficult for me to make friends. i felt isolated and controlled but i trusted and believed everything the respondent said. i thought he loved me and only wanted to protect me.
mr maddox: do you think he might have been just wanting to protect you from going out in what he considered to be an unsafe area? wife: it wasn’t an unsafe area. it was groceries, a laundromat, just shops. but the way [mr jaswal] provided information to me was that i shouldn’t leave home. mr maddox: that might’ve been the situation that he didn’t want you to go out even if it was an area that you now say was safe, but he might not have then wanted you to go out and be unsafe? wife: the area hasn’t changed.
i was very new to the country. i was in a place where i had no idea where i was. i did not have a mobile phone with me at that time. i barely had any money. it was night. [mr jaswal] was very displeased that i wanted to use the facilities and went against him to go and ask a nearby establishment whether i could use their toilets and he abandoned me at that time. he was the only person i knew and i relied on and i was afraid that if i said or did anything. i didn’t even know what would displease him at that time so i was just very frightened of saying or doing anything because i was by myself and i didn’t know anything at the time.
mr maddox: do you think him not speaking to you for weeks on end and ignoring you, that’s family violence? wife: yes – we were not room-mates, we were in a relationship and i was reliant on him as the only person i knew and wanted to have a life with and it brought a lot of things to question as to what i was doing there.
physical assault
third parties
the decision between having legal representation was one that i had to make. my living expenses did not support me being able to fund my living expenses and having legal representation so it was the best choice i could make.
the approach taken ] ...established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties’ respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the post separation period to the point of assessment...
