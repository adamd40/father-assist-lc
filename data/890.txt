hi, [ms hermann]. i have just returned to work this morning. i have just been on leave for a week, so have been unable to fulfil your request within such a short timeframe. i can confirm that i first reviewed you [in early] 2021 - 2022 and we have consulted together seven subsequent times, mostly in person, but also via zoom phone consult twice. you told me you were seeing a subsequent psychologist also. throughout my notes are references to a lot of your symptoms being trauma-related due to excruciating situation ex-husband, with elements of complex post-traumatic stress disorder after. diagnoses have been “generalised anxiety disorder” and “likely post-traumatic stress disorder”. i am sorry that this is not very comprehensive. good luck with court this morning.
hi, all. i don’t agree with [mr ritter’s] interpretation with day-to-day decisions of [x] and i do not consent to him attending the celebration on thursday. reasons: [x] believes i am her mum and dad. she’s aware of this and doesn’t have a daddy. her biological father lives overseas and only sees her once a year at his choice. he left us. [x] does not say she loves him, nor wants to see him, however, we have to abide by law if applicable.
the law
standard of proof
reasonable excuse
you must do everything a parenting order says. in doing so, you cannot be merely passive but must take positive action and this positive obligation includes taking all reasonable steps to ensure that the order is put into effect. you must also positively encourage your children to comply with the orders. for example where the order states your children are to spend time with another party, you must not only ensure that the children are available but must also positively encourage them to go and do so...
...there is an obligation cast upon the custodial parent to take reasonable steps to make the child available for access. it is not open to the custodial parent to do no more than bring the child to the front entrance and invite it to walk of its own accord to the access parent at the garden gate, and to argue that if the child refuses, all her obligations are satisfied by merely standing, as i put it, with folded arms behind the child, doing nothing either to encourage the child to walk to the father or to discourage the child from remaining on the doorstep and, indeed, this situation is directly comparable to it. it is quite clear that such an approach is wrong and that the wife in this circumstance, clearly, was in breach of her obligations under the order.

on occasion, we have issues at new house with wi-fi, never before, because it’s so old or she doesn’t charge it and i instead call off my phone a few times as back-up. i am teaching her. i facilitated calls with her and the other parent every second time, or three times per week, as per consent orders dated 10 july, 12 july, 15 july, 17 july, 19 july, 22 july, 24 july, 26 july, 29 july, 31 july, 2 august for three weeks and so forth. attached is evidence of calls facilitated as per consent order.

that it is the mother’s practice, prior to the father spending time with the child, [x], to provide to him a care plan in relation to [x] and her usual needs. it is acknowledged that the father will receive that care plan and consider that care plan, but it is noted that the care plan is not binding upon the father, but is provided in order to assist him in meeting [x’s] needs.
that a copy of these orders made on 31 july 2020 as amended by these orders made today is annexed to these orders for the purpose of clarity and assistance to the parties to ensure future compliance with both orders, and that the copy of the amended orders should be provided to the children’s schools and treating medical providers in accordance with these orders made.
