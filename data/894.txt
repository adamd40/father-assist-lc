the law as to court’s ability to make declarations as to property
in relation to the parties to a marriage or either of them – means property to which those parties are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or reversion
the law as to donors/gifts
a gift in law is the transfer of any property from one person to another gratuitously. accordingly the intent of the donor must be to give without consideration. to emphasise this latter characteristic in one case it was said that gift is “a present made without return of any kind”. while it may be possible to overstate the position an essential characteristic of a gift is that the transfer of property must be gratuitous.
the law as resulting trusts
where the purchaser of property directs the vendor to convey the property to another person
an implied trust where the beneficial interest in property reverts (results) to the person who transferred the property upon trust or provided the means of obtaining it. the principal situations are... the presumed resulting trust, where property is conveyed the name of someone other than provider of the consideration
jacob’s law of trusts in australia (7th ed) provides a convenient summary in respect of resulting trusts...  10] a resulting trust will be presumed where, on a purchase, the legal title to real or personal property is vested in someone other than the person who is proved... to have provided the purchase money. [1212] a resulting trust is made in the foregoing circumstances because the court presumes, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that the person paying the purchase money intended to obtain the beneficial interest in the property.

don’t scare me by reporting me. i will have to report you and [mr sandine] (the nickname wife used for the husband) right now. you can lose your fucking house right now. remember you dealt with all of this. i have screenshots of your transactions with [mr sandine]. you fucking moron you gonna ruin my kids future. goes to show your true colour. you asshole. your business and finance will fail starting this year. keep talking [mr koo] you don’t know who i am and what i’m capable of. start telling your parents you lost your house in australia. fuck you. you and your parents will fail starting this year the scammers. you don’t know me you shouldn’t have threatened i will make sure you fail so don’t fuck with me and my kids. you’re nothing but a piece of shit to me. i’d rather pay the fine than giving you the satisfaction of keeping your house here. i’d rather go to jail and my kids become homeless than making you win. fuck your. just remember this. if you’re willing to lose that house and pay the $70k fine for your friend [mr sandine]. this will set me back to pay my $70k back. i will give up my kids to [mr sandine]. i won’t help them he will not hear back from me no help from me with our kids together until my finances with again. do that for your friend. this is my reality. do not test me. i) i give no credence to the wife’s argument it was mr e that generated the text messages to mr koo in march 2020 without the knowledge or direct input of the wife and i make this finding based on the following: (a) at the time the messages were sent the wife and mr e had only been in a serious relationship for a very short period of time. (b) in the messages the husband is referred to as “mr sandine” (which is how the wife addressed the husband) whereas mr e calls the husband mr sandine. (c) the messages are too detailed to have been put together by a third party with there being a reference to: “your house” as to mr koo being the owner of b street, suburb c. the involvement of mr koo parents. the mention of the $70,000 fine (which is the amount of the fine that could be imposed by firb). the knowledge of how to report mr koo and the husband to the authorities. the knowledge that mr koo would pay the fine for the husband. the threat to leave the children with the husband if the wife’s finances were not sufficient. (d) mr e’s evidence on sending the text messages during cross-examination was vague and contradictory with mr e being unable, when questioned by the bench, to comprehensively explain his knowledge of the situation regarding the parties and the arrangements for b street, suburb c. (e) mr e when sending other messages or emails on behalf of the wife made it clear that he was acting as a third person on behalf of the wife who he referred to as “my representee”. (f) the tone adopted in the text messages is similar to the tone used by the wife: in the wife’s threat to report mr koo to the authorities as detailed in her email to mr koo’s lawyers just prior to the discrete hearing. in the wife’s written evidence where the wife writes about the “change” in “direction” in the parenting arrangements should b street, suburb c not form part of the property pool. in the wife’s answer to the question from the bench “how does that translate to changing directions in the parenting matters” where the wife responded “either i take the kids full time or he has to take them full-time”. (xiii) i do not accept the wife’s argument that because the arrangement between the parties about b street, suburb c was not in writing then it was not a valid arrangement. (xiv) i do not accept the wife’s argument that mr koo was a donor, that the husband was a promisor and that the wife was the promisee therefore resulting in b street, suburb c having been gifted to the wife as it was always the intention of mr koo that b street, suburb c would ultimately be transferred to mr koo and that mr koo would use it as his place of residence in australia. (xv) therefore the requirement of the gift being given in a gratuitous manner as is required to support an argument that the gift had been given by a donor has not been satisfied. (xvi) the wife was reminded as to mr koo’s funding of b street, suburb c in legal correspondence sent by the husband’s lawyers in july 2020. (xvii) prior to the wife commencing property proceedings in june 2021, all parties attended mediation which is evidence of the wife’s acknowledgement of mr koo’s interest in b street, suburb c. (xviii) the wife however chose to ignore mr koo’s interest in b street, suburb c when the proceedings were commenced and went so far as to deny any knowledge of his financial contributions to b street, suburb c in her supporting affidavit, a position that she has continued to hold leading up to and including the discrete hearing despite comprehensive evidence to the contrary. (xix) the court however acknowledged mr koo’s potential interest in the property pool and ordered for his joinder to the proceedings as the second respondent. (xx) shortly after court proceedings were commenced the husband arranged for firb to be notified as to the arrangements. (xxi) a few months later a similar notification was made by mr koo. (xxii) the credibility of the evidence of the husband and mr koo as the arrangement is borne out by the actions that both of these parties have taken to admit their wrongdoings to the authorities in how the arrangement was set out. (xxiii) the wife however has not been proactive in notifying the authorities and has structured her evidence in such a way to deliberately try and have access to property that the wife knows does not form part of the property pool. (xxiv) based on the above i find that the parties were aware and supportive of the arrangement whereby b street, suburb c was being held by the husband and the wife pending the immigration of mr koo to australia whereby b street, suburb c would be transferred to mr koo. (xxv) i find that this arrangement amounts to a resulting trust and that the husband and the wife hold b street, suburb c on trust for the sole benefit of mr koo. (xxvi) therefore b street, suburb c cannot be declared matrimonial property that can be subjected to alteration pursuant to section 79. (e) use of the rent from b street, suburb c (i) the evidence supports the husband and wife have struggled at times to make the mortgage payments on b(2) street, suburb c and that the struggle continues as the wife is no longer in receipt of rental from b street, suburb c. (ii) i accept the evidence of mr koo that the reason why he allowed the wife access to the rental generated by b street, suburb c was to protect his equity in b street, suburb c. (iii) mr koo held serious concerns that if the wife did not have access to sufficient monies to meet the mortgage on b(2) street, suburb c then the mortgagee may foreclose on b(2) street, suburb c and take action against the husband and the wife for any shortfall. (iv) i accept mr koo’s fear that as the husband and the wife are the registered owners of b street, suburb c then any shortfall may have been pursued by taking action against b street, suburb c. (v) i do not accept that allowing the wife to receive rental from b street, suburb c supports the wife in her argument that the wife together of the husband are the true owners of b street, suburb c. (f) the wife’s non-financial and financial contributions to b street, suburb c (i) i accept that the wife: (a) contributed $2,000 towards the renovations conducted by the husband and mr koo on b street, suburb c. (b) contributed some $450 towards the plumbing costs for b street, suburb c. (c) contributed financially for the insurance on b street, suburb c. (d) arranged for the letting agent for b street, suburb c. (ii) however, i find that such contributions do not give rise to the wife any equitable interest in b street, suburb c as this contribution was offset and outweighed by the wife’s ability to access the rental on b street, suburb c and use the funds exclusively to pay for the mortgage and outgoings on b(2) street, suburb c since 2019 until the property became vacant in 2023.  ii) i do not accept the wife’s argument that because the arrangement between the parties about b street, suburb c was not in writing then it was not a valid arrangement. (xiv) i do not accept the wife’s argument that mr koo was a donor, that the husband was a promisor and that the wife was the promisee therefore resulting in b street, suburb c having been gifted to the wife as it was always the intention of mr koo that b street, suburb c would ultimately be transferred to mr koo and that mr koo would use it as his place of residence in australia. (xv) therefore the requirement of the gift being given in a gratuitous manner as is required to support an argument that the gift had been given by a donor has not been satisfied. (xvi) the wife was reminded as to mr koo’s funding of b street, suburb c in legal correspondence sent by the husband’s lawyers in july 2020. (xvii) prior to the wife commencing property proceedings in june 2021, all parties attended mediation which is evidence of the wife’s acknowledgement of mr koo’s interest in b street, suburb c.

(f) the wife’s non-financial and financial contributions to b street, suburb c (i) i accept that the wife: (a) contributed $2,000 towards the renovations conducted by the husband and mr koo on b street, suburb c. (b) contributed some $450 towards the plumbing costs for b street, suburb c. (c) contributed financially for the insurance on b street, suburb c. (d) arranged for the letting agent for b street, suburb c. (ii) however, i find that such contributions do not give rise to the wife any equitable interest in b street, suburb c as this contribution was offset and outweighed by the wife’s ability to access the rental on b street, suburb c and use the funds exclusively to pay for the mortgage and outgoings on b(2) street, suburb c since 2019 until the property became vacant in 2023.  v) i do not accept the wife’s argument that mr koo was a donor, that the husband was a promisor and that the wife was the promisee therefore resulting in b street, suburb c having been gifted to the wife as it was always the intention of mr koo that b street, suburb c would ultimately be transferred to mr koo and that mr koo would use it as his place of residence in australia. (xv) therefore the requirement of the gift being given in a gratuitous manner as is required to support an argument that the gift had been given by a donor has not been satisfied. (xvi) the wife was reminded as to mr koo’s funding of b street, suburb c in legal correspondence sent by the husband’s lawyers in july 2020. (xvii) prior to the wife commencing property proceedings in june 2021, all parties attended mediation which is evidence of the wife’s acknowledgement of mr koo’s interest in b street, suburb c. (xviii) the wife however chose to ignore mr koo’s interest in b street, suburb c when the proceedings were commenced and went so far as to deny any knowledge of his financial contributions to b street, suburb c in her supporting affidavit, a position that she has continued to hold leading up to and including the discrete hearing despite comprehensive evidence to the contrary. (xix) the court however acknowledged mr koo’s potential interest in the property pool and ordered for his joinder to the proceedings as the second respondent. (xx) shortly after court proceedings were commenced the husband arranged for firb to be notified as to the arrangements. (xxi) a few months later a similar notification was made by mr koo. (xxii) the credibility of the evidence of the husband and mr koo as the arrangement is borne out by the actions that both of these parties have taken to admit their wrongdoings to the authorities in how the arrangement was set out. (xxiii) the wife however has not been proactive in notifying the authorities and has structured her evidence in such a way to deliberately try and have access to property that the wife knows does not form part of the property pool. (xxiv) based on the above i find that the parties were aware and supportive of the arrangement whereby b street, suburb c was being held by the husband and the wife pending the immigration of mr koo to australia whereby b street, suburb c would be transferred to mr koo. (xxv) i find that this arrangement amounts to a resulting trust and that the husband and the wife hold b street, suburb c on trust for the sole benefit of mr koo. (xxvi) therefore b street, suburb c cannot be declared matrimonial property that can be subjected to alteration pursuant to section 79. (e) use of the rent from b street, suburb c (i) the evidence supports the husband and wife have struggled at times to make the mortgage payments on b(2) street, suburb c and that the struggle continues as the wife is no longer in receipt of rental from b street, suburb c. (ii) i accept the evidence of mr koo that the reason why he allowed the wife access to the rental generated by b street, suburb c was to protect his equity in b street, suburb c. (iii) mr koo held serious concerns that if the wife did not have access to sufficient monies to meet the mortgage on b(2) street, suburb c then the mortgagee may foreclose on b(2) street, suburb c and take action against the husband and the wife for any shortfall. (iv) i accept mr koo’s fear that as the husband and the wife are the registered owners of b street, suburb c then any shortfall may have been pursued by taking action against b street, suburb c.

(iv) i accept mr koo’s fear that as the husband and the wife are the registered owners of b street, suburb c then any shortfall may have been pursued by taking action against b street, suburb c. (v) i do not accept that allowing the wife to receive rental from b street, suburb c supports the wife in her argument that the wife together of the husband are the true owners of b street, suburb c. (f) the wife’s non-financial and financial contributions to b street, suburb c (i) i accept that the wife: (a) contributed $2,000 towards the renovations conducted by the husband and mr koo on b street, suburb c. (b) contributed some $450 towards the plumbing costs for b street, suburb c. (c) contributed financially for the insurance on b street, suburb c. (d) arranged for the letting agent for b street, suburb c. (ii) however, i find that such contributions do not give rise to the wife any equitable interest in b street, suburb c as this contribution was offset and outweighed by the wife’s ability to access the rental on b street, suburb c and use the funds exclusively to pay for the mortgage and outgoings on b(2) street, suburb c since 2019 until the property became vacant in 2023.  iv) based on the above i find that the parties were aware and supportive of the arrangement whereby b street, suburb c was being held by the husband and the wife pending the immigration of mr koo to australia whereby b street, suburb c would be transferred to mr koo. (xxv) i find that this arrangement amounts to a resulting trust and that the husband and the wife hold b street, suburb c on trust for the sole benefit of mr koo. (xxvi) therefore b street, suburb c cannot be declared matrimonial property that can be subjected to alteration pursuant to section 79. (e) use of the rent from b street, suburb c (i) the evidence supports the husband and wife have struggled at times to make the mortgage payments on b(2) street, suburb c and that the struggle continues as the wife is no longer in receipt of rental from b street, suburb c.
