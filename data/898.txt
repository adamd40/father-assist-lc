“rose-coloured glasses” on when it came to her son’s deficits (including her knowledge of the more recent allegations about ms l), i found her to be a stoic person who is used to operating in the world of “mandatory reporters” by virtue of her occupation in the early childhood sector. it was her lived experience in this world that caused her to say that she would need “proof” before she took steps to action complaints against her son. now, having sat through most of the trial and hearing of some of the terrible things her son has done to the mother (arising at the very least out of his breaches of the 2019 advo) and how that has impacted on the mother and the risks he poses to the children, i am satisfied that she is now armed with sufficient information to enable her to act protectively of the children and not put her son’s interests ahead of her own. i know she is largely untested but that is through no fault of her own and nonetheless the mother and the maternal grandmother still see her as an appropriate supervisor, (b) whilst it is true enough that the children lived in the maternal grandmother’s home for a significant period of time during which one or more them were exposed to serious neglect, any actions she did or did not take were not the reason for their exposure – that falls squarely at the feet of the mother. this finding however does not diminish my concerns about her failure to act effectively in the past to support the children as being an indicator of what may happen in the future.   whilst it is true enough that the children lived

what consideration should be given to the perpetration of family violence and what inferences should be drawn from the family violence orders?
with whom should the children live?  the various supervision reports of his time with the children reflected an overall positive experience for the children, (b) the observations of the family report writer reflected the same outcome, and (c) the parties agreed that the children have a meaningful relationship with him.   the observations of the family report writer reflected the same outcome, and (c) the parties agreed that the children have a meaningful relationship with him.   the parties agreed that the children have a meaningful relationship with him.
