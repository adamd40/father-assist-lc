judge glass:
in the event the mother does not make [x] available to spend time with the father in accordance with these orders on two occasions in any twelve month period, save unless otherwise agreed between the parties in writing or further court order, [x] forthwith live in the primary care of the father.[1]
...whether [x’s] best interests are met by continuing to live with [ms harry] in order to ascertain whether she is capable of prospectively facilitating [x’s] time with her father, or whether [x] should immediately be moved to live with her father.
that arose against a background of ms harry’s non-compliance with a multitude of interim orders providing for x to spend time with her father. i noted that of central importance in the proceedings had been ms harry’s past failure to comply with such orders.
