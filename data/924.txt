federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2)
mohsen & collings [2023] fedcfamc2f 544
orders
the court orders that:
ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge murdoch
in the proper exercise of the primary judgeâ€™s discretion, the applications for adjournment and amendment were not to be considered solely by reference to whether any prejudice..... could be compensated by costs. both the primary judge and the court of appeal should have taken into account that, whatever costs are ordered, there is an irreparable element of unfair prejudice in unnecessarily delaying proceedings. moreover, the time of the court is a publicly funded resource. inefficiencies in the use of that resource, arising from the vacation or adjournment of trials, are to be taken into account. so too is the need to maintain public confidence in the judicial system.
