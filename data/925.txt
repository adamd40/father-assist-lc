when did the de facto relationship break down?
13. ...(the “touchstone” finding) is the seminal test to which the various “circumstances” prescribed in s 4aa(2) are all directed. importantly, a court’s discussion and consideration of particular circumstances found to be relevant in any one case should not be seen as giving rise to binding principles of law or as substituting for the words of the statute: sinclair v whittaker [2013] famcafc 129 at [94], and by definition, the actions of a party or parties which are said to be unequivocally indicative of and consistent only with, the cessation of the de facto relationship will vary from case to case. as the full court emphasised in sinclair v whittaker, every relationship is different. and as a marriage relies upon the continued existence of the consortium vitae, so too a de facto relationship relies upon the parties continuing to live as a couple on a genuine domestic basis as required by s4aa.
each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point at one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test.
29. a de facto relationship will have broken down when, having regard to all the circumstances, the parties no longer “have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis”. such a conclusion is not precluded by the presence of an ongoing relationship of some sort. that is not the inquiry. the question is whether a de facto relationship exists or has broken down. 30. in the context of a human relationship, “breakdown” refers to the “end” or “breakup” of what had been an enduring emotional bond...   the lack of specificity in evidence and/or submissions about either the parties’ actual declarations (viz there was no copy of the actual form) or the effect of such declarations upon the parties’ competing evidence about the breakdown of the relationship, and (b) the inability to afford the parties proper procedural fairness to argue the application (or otherwise) of the “the elias principle”.   the inability to afford the parties proper procedural fairness to argue the application (or otherwise) of the “the elias principle”.   ms preston says that she accepted a job in suburb c sydney in late 2020 because (at least in part if not in totality) mr beltran had expressed a desire to relocate to sydney[16], (b) ms preston says that in march/april 2021 and july/august2021 she lived at the family home and took over caring responsibilities such as getting the boys to and from school and to their extra-curricular activities (which leads me to conclude that mr beltran did not re-locate to sydney),[17] (c) mr beltran says that in march 2021 we decided to stop seeing other for good[18], and (d) ms preston says that the parties finally separated on 8 april 2021 (which suggest that even after that event, the parties were able to agree that she could return to the family home in july/august 2021).[19]   ms preston says that in march/april 2021 and july/august2021 she lived at the family home and took over caring responsibilities such as getting the boys to and from school and to their extra-curricular activities (which leads me to conclude that mr beltran did not re-locate to sydney),[17] (c) mr beltran says that in march 2021 we decided to stop seeing other for good[18], and (d) ms preston says that the parties finally separated on 8 april 2021 (which suggest that even after that event, the parties were able to agree that she could return to the family home in july/august 2021).[19]   mr beltran says that in march 2021 we decided to stop seeing other for good[18], and (d) ms preston says that the parties finally separated on 8 april 2021 (which suggest that even after that event, the parties were able to agree that she could return to the family home in july/august 2021).[19]   ms preston says that the parties finally separated on 8 april 2021 (which suggest that even after that event, the parties were able to agree that she could return to the family home in july/august 2021).[19]
conclusion  ms preston moving out of the family home, (b) the parties notifying centrelink of their separation and the consequential arrangement for mr beltran to have full-time care of the boys, (c) the boys spending time (or living with) ms preston in a separate residence after may 2018, (d) ms preston re-locating to sydney for work purposes on her own (despite an alleged expression by mr beltran that he would too), (e) ms preston becoming so concerned about the care and support provided by mr beltran to the boys, that she suggested the boys come into her full-time care, being (essentially) a reversal of the boys’ lived experience up until that time and certainly not being suggestive of them having a mutual commitment to a shared life, (f) ms preston giving no evidence of anything particularly positive (or otherwise) to support the parties’ having an enduring emotional bond[23] post-may 2018,   the parties notifying centrelink of their separation and the consequential arrangement for mr beltran to have full-time care of the boys, (c) the boys spending time (or living with) ms preston in a separate residence after may 2018, (d) ms preston re-locating to sydney for work purposes on her own (despite an alleged expression by mr beltran that he would too), (e) ms preston becoming so concerned about the care and support provided by mr beltran to the boys, that she suggested the boys come into her full-time care, being (essentially) a reversal of the boys’ lived experience up until that time and certainly not being suggestive of them having a mutual commitment to a shared life, (f) ms preston giving no evidence of anything particularly positive (or otherwise) to support the parties’ having an enduring emotional bond[23] post-may 2018,   the boys spending time (or living with) ms preston in a separate residence after may 2018, (d) ms preston re-locating to sydney for work purposes on her own (despite an alleged expression by mr beltran that he would too), (e) ms preston becoming so concerned about the care and support provided by mr beltran to the boys, that she suggested the boys come into her full-time care, being (essentially) a reversal of the boys’ lived experience up until that time and certainly not being suggestive of them having a mutual commitment to a shared life, (f) ms preston giving no evidence of anything particularly positive (or otherwise) to support the parties’ having an enduring emotional bond[23] post-may 2018,   ms preston re-locating to sydney for work purposes on her own (despite an alleged expression by mr beltran that he would too), (e) ms preston becoming so concerned about the care and support provided by mr beltran to the boys, that she suggested the boys come into her full-time care, being (essentially) a reversal of the boys’ lived experience up until that time and certainly not being suggestive of them having a mutual commitment to a shared life, (f) ms preston giving no evidence of anything particularly positive (or otherwise) to support the parties’ having an enduring emotional bond[23] post-may 2018,   ms preston becoming so concerned about the care and support provided by mr beltran to the boys, that she suggested the boys come into her full-time care, being (essentially) a reversal of the boys’ lived experience up until that time and certainly not being suggestive of them having a mutual commitment to a shared life, (f) ms preston giving no evidence of anything particularly positive (or otherwise) to support the parties’ having an enduring emotional bond[23] post-may 2018,   ms preston giving no evidence of anything particularly positive (or otherwise) to support the parties’ having an enduring emotional bond[23] post-may 2018,
essentially every case is unique and what defines the particular relationship in question requiring of idiosyncratic consideration. in this regard, i bear in mind the strictures laid down by mushin j in moby & schulter and remember that the circumstances of modern life have an infinite capacity to throw up diverse relationships, outside the norms and mores of the social mainstream, which are nonetheless to be accounted de facto relationships, given the definition contained in section 4aa(1).
