$   where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) flc 92-816 the full court said at 85,262:
“11.6 for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out.” (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654:   where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654:
“in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly.” (c) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644: “as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. conduct of the kind referred to in para. (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under sec 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of sec 79.”  in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644:   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.
... her honour seems to be saying that the mere fact that a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation, will result in that expenditure being added back “in the usual way” as a premature distribution of assets with nothing more. if that is what her honour is saying, in our view, she is being unduly simplistic. in our opinion, it was a necessary requirement for her honour to examine and make some assessment of the reasonableness or otherwise of the expenditure.   the husband’s evidence in his trial affidavit at paragraphs 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 66, 67, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, (b) his oral evidence pertaining to importing a container from country af in relation to paragraph 66(b) of his trial affidavit, (c) his oral evidence relating to spending not more than $500 per week on food, fuel and travel and being part of his “living expenses” referred to in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit, and, (d) his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit.   his oral evidence pertaining to importing a container from country af in relation to paragraph 66(b) of his trial affidavit, (c) his oral evidence relating to spending not more than $500 per week on food, fuel and travel and being part of his “living expenses” referred to in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit, and, (d) his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit.   his oral evidence relating to spending not more than $500 per week on food, fuel and travel and being part of his “living expenses” referred to in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit, and, (d) his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit.   his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit.   mortgage loan repayments for the former property at town u owned by the parties: a total of about $32,629. in this context, the court observes that the former property at town u was the only property with a mortgage loan outstanding from about september 2018 until june 2021, and there are references to income received (the court would infer rental income) and noted as credits in annexure 12 (eg, “town u” on 1 june 2021), (b) payments to the business k pty ltd: a total of about $65,770, (c) payments to overseas creditors in relation to the above business, including importing expenses for this business: a total of about $73,034. (the court observes, inter alia, that the nab debit entries making up this total link up with the husband’s business visits to country af to purchase stock for the business in october 2018, february/march 2019, and noting that the husband’s affidavit evidence was that the duration of his country af business visits varied but were for about two weeks at a time, there are references to, eg, “country af trans”, “container”), (d) by reference in particular to annexure 12 there are payments for reasonable living expenses, including expenses for agl, “bill payment”, transport, pickup, tradesperson, glasses and gym: a total of about $10,305, (e) from 4 september 2018, (being the date the husband received the net proceeds of sale of the p street, suburb q property, $534,970) until about 1 june 2021 (being the end date of the bank statements in annexure 12), a period of about 142 weeks, the husband reasonably expended the sum of $71,000 (142 times $500 per week) for food, fuel and travel expenses.   payments to the business k pty ltd: a total of about $65,770, (c) payments to overseas creditors in relation to the above business, including importing expenses for this business: a total of about $73,034.
