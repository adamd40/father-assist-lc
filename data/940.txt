reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
that consideration be given to changing the current shared care arrangements to reduce the time that [x] is away from either parent, such as [x] living with his mother every monday and tuesday night, and [x] living with his father every wednesday and thursday night, and with each of his parent’s alternate weekends.[1]  hat is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents’ proposals embraced in competing applications involve again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children’s best interests.[5]
background
the parties had very different narratives about the nature of their relationship. however both acknowledged that [x] is a happy little boy who loves spending time with each of them, which suggests both have been able to protect him from their conflicted relationship and current proceedings. ..... both acknowledge that [x], who has never experienced his parents living together, as a couple, is a happy little boy who is oblivious, up to now, of any discord between his parents.[8]
unless both parties shift from their polarised views of each other and become genuinely committed to mutually supporting, fostering and facilitating [x]’s relationship with the other parent, (which will require improved communication between them, focussed on ensuring consistent care routines across the households, including night time toileting practices), then [x]’s current transitional distress may well develop into maladaptive behaviours that can only be viewed as detrimental to his emotional wellbeing in the long term.[10]
while the parents had [earlier] presented as child-focussed and appeared willing to resolve their issues, this is clearly not the case now, and there was no indication that the parties could successfully co-parent due to their animosity towards and/or abuse of each other.[13]
i have only recently come to terms with the sexual assaults. i also took the step of reporting them to the police, which i had come to feel i needed to do, despite feeling humiliated and exposed.[16]
the evidence & issues
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term unacceptable risk. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.[23]
the parties
the parties’ present circumstances
issues surrounding the mother’s mental health and substance abuse
x and pork consumption
x’s attire
it is my belief that the mother deliberately dressed [x] in girl’s clothing and accessories, subverting the child’s identity and gender to try and get a negative reaction from me. i believe that the manipulation of [x] in this way is confusing and harmful to him.[33]
pre-school issues
given your low iq, i tried to make it very simple, but after my two emails, you still did not get it... everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie. if you were a bit clever...when one goes to uni at 40+ with illustrious alcohol dependency career, one loses the ability of mind to critically read, analyse and understand ideas.
to which the mother replied with you will not be seeing x until we have come to an agreement. this stance is justified by her assertion – i am x’s primary carer.[34]
hacking issues and restraining order
events leading up to the interim hearing of may 2022
the family report e father] presented as singularly focussed on criticisms of the mother’s parenting of [x], with these criticisms informing his belief that he is the better parent and that [x] is at risk in the mother’s care. at no point the father was the father able to identify anything positive about the mother, despite being given opportunities to do so.[38]  mpressed as [being] weary and emotionally overwrought, which she attributed to having been subjected to unremitting belittling and denigration by the father, both during the relationship and post separation.[39]
this accorded with my own impression of her.
..i think my recommendations still stand, you know, when i listen to what has been happening thus far, in a sense of having [x] in the same time with each parent, say, monday-tuesday with mum, wednesday and thursday with dad. fixed days every week. he’s not too long away from either parent. and then alternate weekends. and that allows the parents to do specific things on the nights that they always have the child during term. this is my recipe for parallel parenting, i might say. yes? and there’s no real need to communicate a lot. handovers are all at school, because he’s now seven, so he will be at school. so that minimises and face-to-face contact. both parents will need to make sure that they keep in touch with the school, so that there’s any – so that they’re aware of what is going to be happening on the days that they have the child. well, the school can be enjoined to do that ? exactly, yes. and say, “look, two reports. two sets of newsletters”? yes, which they would be doing now, i would imagine, anyway. i would imagine. no one has told me? because i think, as i said before – i think both of them complement each other in a sense of who they are as people. and i think if they could just offer that side of – see, high conflict doesn’t only affect [x]. it affects their parenting abilities as well. so they’re diminished as parents whilst they’re in this conflict. so [x] is actually losing – double fault – the effect on him, but also the effect on each of his parents who, i have to say, after separating in 2014 – they have been in unremitting conflict since then. that has to take its toll on an adult’s psyche and ability – in their mental health, their wellbeing – everything – and their ability to parent. so this conflict is not just about the impact on [x]. it’s about the impact on these parents and their ability to be parents. it’s diminishing, the longer they stay in this system, and the longer they don’t settle down with an arrangement that’s viable for [x], and to let go of all this past conflict, because i can’t imagine what [x]’s life is like now. to sum, are you saying it’s in naïve to think through this process, one party is going to land the knockout blow on the other? no. they would have done that well and truly by now, if that had been the case. this is – there’s no end in sight in regard to this conflict. usually, conflict resolves about 12 months – high conflict resolves after about 12 months after separation, where there’s a sort of settling down and – but this hasn’t happened in this one. it has escalated. listening to what has happened, it has actually escalated. and whether that’s covid underpinning that – we can all blame covid for everything, but the fact that it’s still present and we’re still in this system – i had thought that this was the second day of the trial, but i’ve been told it’s the fifth day of trial. we’re in a system where there’s no winners, really.[40]
there was a strong sense that [x] could not understand why his father wanted him to live with him more than he lived with his mother when he felt that he loved both parents equally. when questioned about the current parenting arrangements [x] said they were “kinda okay” before adding spontaneously, “the thing is...i’d really like for my mum to live in the same house as my dad...when i was born they did live in the same house but the truth is they don’t like each other now”. [x] was clearly conflicted by the realisation that his parents do not like each other, and his awareness in this regard suggests that he has been exposed to conflict between his parents, and/or denigration by one or other of his parents. this was confirmed when [x] reported, “my dad says mean things about my mum...sometimes he says i can’t do stuff at his house”. [x] described “kinda” missing his mother when with his father and after a long pause, he added that he “kinda” missed his father when he was with his mother. however, [x] spontaneously disclosed at this point, upon reflection, “i might love my mum a tad bit stronger than my dad”. there was no sense that [x] had been influenced or coached in his responses but rather that he was trying to measure his sense of emotional loss when with one or other parent. [x]’s expressed emotional bias for his mother over his father is commensurate with his young age and ongoing emotional reliance on his mother. when comparing living with each parent, [x] said that he has “fun times” with both parents, although he added, ‘sometimes i get bored in the car’. he said he has been smacked by both parents, adding, “mum hits me when i’m naughty and dad jokes he hits me by hitting me softly on my bum”. he then described having “a very big bed at dad’s...i sleep there all by myself” and that “sometimes” he sleeps with his mother adding, “the first night of each week i sleep with mum before when i get handed (sic) over at school”, which is consistent with the mother’s report that [x] is still struggling to separate from her when he knows he will not be seeing her for six days. when asked what three wishes he would choose, [x] reiterated his wish for his mother to live with his father, adding, “and to have infinity wishes and for everyone i know to have super powers”. the overall impression of [x] is that he enjoys his time with each of his parents but his emotional needs are being met more by his mother than by his father.[41]
the father was attentive and interactive with [x] in this setting, introducing educative themes, such as encouraging [x] to count in [language d] and translating english words into [language d]. at one point, [x] climbed on his father’s shoulders, which made his father laugh before they then began talking about [sports] ... there was a sense of indulgent playfulness between father and son, with ball games and shared memories and experiences...[42]
each parent blames the other for being “impossible” to communicate with, with neither seeming to realise the detrimental effect on [x] of the poor relations between them. both parents are likely to feel under siege and defensive and less inclined to communicate with the other about [x], much to [x]’s detriment as he needs consistency and stability in both households if he is to maintain a healthy developmental trajectory.[43]
unless both parties shift from their polarised views of each other and become genuinely committed to mutually supporting, fostering and facilitating [x]’s relationship with the other parent, (which will require improved communication between them, focussed on ensuring consistent care routines across the households, including night time toileting practices), then [x]’s current transitional distress may well develop into maladaptive behaviours that can only be viewed as detrimental to his emotional wellbeing in the long term. [x]’s reference to his need to sleep with his mother at the beginning of the week before he transitioned to his father on tuesday, is consistent with the mother’s report that [x] struggles to separate from her when he knows he will not be seeing her for six days. whilst this report does not support a shift from shared care of [x] to the father’s proposal for primary carer and sole parental responsibility for [x], the current shared care arrangements appear to be placing undue stress on [x]. accordingly, consideration could be given to changing the shared care arrangements so that [x] is not away from either parent for six days, such as [x] living with each parent for two fixed days/nights each week, along with alternate weekends during the school term, which is in effect, a 50:50 shared care arrangement, which was the father’s original proposal. whilst these arrangements increase the number of transitions for [x], with the bulk of handovers at school, and with the understanding that he will be not be away from either parent for more than two sleeps, (apart from weekends) it is anticipated that his separation anxiety will not be as acute, as seems currently to be the case. with the fixed days the parents’ will be able to arrange activities for [x] that do not require the other parent to continue in their time. however, extracurricular activities on the weekends will require an agreement between the parties so that [x] is able to attend that specific activity each weekend, rather than miss out if one parent has not agreed to the activity.[44]
legal principles applicable  ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.
the principles, which underpin these objects, are set out in section 60b(2) and are as follows: (a) children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.  iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.  aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[47]
...it is not as if, as soon as communication difficulties between the parties, or other difficulties between them are identified, the discretion ought not be exercised... rather, the matter is one of balancing all relevant factors...[57]
in my view, i must be careful not to adopt an unduly utopian standard for the parties’ communication skills or expect them to adhere to a standard, which is clearly untenable, given that they separated in difficult and acrimonious circumstances, as many couples do, particularly those that seek the court’s assistance to resolve their parenting disputes.
whilst parental responsibility is vaguely defined, some insight into what is needed from a parent can be seen in s 65dac(3) which provides that if both parents have that responsibility, they are taken to be required to consult about parenting issues and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision. it will again be remembered that the focus of the objects and principles in this act is on joint parenting.[61]  s a broad concept as described in s 61b and that task covers many things. parents are expected jointly to endeavour to promote their children’s development by ensuring they have the greatest potential in adulthood whilst at the same time enjoying the security of childhood they deserve.[62]
decisions about international travel are difficult to make because no-one can foretell the future and the decision i have to make here amounts to a leap of faith. the court determines discretionary matters within the framework of the evidence that it is presented.
