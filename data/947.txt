credit of parties ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... [citations omitted]  ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (“carlson”) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case:  5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw.
... 9] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide.  ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.

there are days that i have to work but i have already booked them into various programs. seeing as you won't even take them to a psychologist, and look after what are their basic needs, let alone care about their education, i do not wish for them to be in you and your mother's care with the television on. you make it impossible to coparent, and your behaviour nothing short of unfatherly. i have no respect for you
from the father:
no but i am only taking him if you pay for it as i pay for their private health insurance.
from the mother:
i am not paying for it. health insurance doesnt cover everything.
i am not taking them to any health appointments that i do not initiate. please cancel all that you have arranged without my consent
i guess i should be grateful that you will take him considering you don't think it is important that they learn to swim... father of the year. [ellipses in original]
interesting that you verbalised yr concern about [y’s] speech tonight at parent teacher, but yet see no need to take her to the speech pathologist yourself. not sure who you are kidding in this scenario
it's about time you considered financial and time contributions to their medical costs.
the father responded the following day as follows:
i pay for their private health insurance.
the mother responded:
stop kidding yourself. you will take him and pay for it.
btw not very nice for a son to be dumped on a doorstep at changeover by his father.
he was not "dumped" i walked him to the door and kissed him good bye. i was just avoiding another earful from you
really? the car was on when i opened the door. what a load of bullshit- i never give you an earful. i don't bother speaking to you because you struggle to comprehend basic conversation and are unable to communicate. they don't need to hear the crap that comes out of your mouth.
i don't have any international legally enforceable assurance that, should circumstances change and you decide to keep the children out of australia, i could make sure they live in melb. i'm happy for them to have [country e] passports when they are older just not at the moment.   would want to know that [grandfather] [the mother's father] is still here. if you wanted to see him while [y] is at [[music lessons]] around the corner he can. he [the mother's father] is sleeping peacefully he was wanting to see him tomorrow but i suspect they today would be better.
the father responded:
he will stay at home while she's at [music lessons]. he hasn't asked so i won't remind him.
he might not ask you but it might be on his mind so please tell him.
what do you want to speak to [x] about? u only dropped him off at school this morning [the monday]
he was sad on the weekend so i just wanted to reassure him.
reassure him that you are the asshole that wouldn't let him see his grandfather before he died. don't worry [the mother's father] knew it till the end, even in his demented state exactly what you stood for
i was disappointed you never informed me that they both missed school last friday
the teachers were informed prior to this, and it was logged online to which you have access to.
that system is not designed to notify parents of school absence
i am not required to inform you
refusing to contribute to taking them and paying for medical appointments is not fulfilling your parental duties. you need to work on your communication alongside your parental contributions or rather lack of. they are getting older and can see you for who you are with their own eyes.
and also the following (from the mother) on the same day:
you have never shown that you have maintained their health insurance as orders have indicated you must. i do not believe that you have and will never trust that you will. the fact that you think your contributions stop at health insurance is very sad and very inaccurate. that you keep referencing your lawyer and not the actual signed agreement that does not say i need to pay for everything is also concerning and negligent at best.
you have millions of dollars and you do not pay for any child rearing costs so never use that excuse. i also need to work to pay for their needs. something you don't contribute to. i regularly have to take time off to take them to these necessary appointments. it is actual not an option. this has happened for many years. both taking and paying for them is what a parent does. do you understand that? perhaps you should never have had children.
not clawing anything. the agreement signed was one where you are supposed to take care of the children and associated costs whilst they are in your care. again it is not specified anywhere that i should pay for the extracurricular, schooling, uniform, medical so i will continue to ask for your contribution which you can choose to decline at the knowledge that one day your children will realise how inappropriate and selfish your behaviour is, and how inappropriate it is for a father to pay for nothing. there was no agreement signed in 2016 because you wanted money for child support/maintenance and we all know how that would/did turn out. i pay for the children and then i have to pay you. shameful at best.
your lack of responsibility as a parent to provide prescribed medical treatment for your son is clear. this is neglect. your refusal to contribute to your share of their health costs is shameful.
the fear in your children about returning to school when they are in your care without uniform should make you ashamed. unfortunately i don't think you can see the damage you have and continue to do. it's disgusting.
i’ll only take her.
please advise why you have [not] notified me that [x] has not had his plate in for 5 days? do you want him to have the surgery you had? because unless he wears it that is exactly where he is heading. you have been advised on multiple occasions that he needs to wear it.
the father responded as follows:
please advise why it has taken you 5 days to admit that you forgot to check whether he had remembered his plate. you're the [health care professional] so i don't question your decisions here.
yes i admit it took me 5 days to go and clean the boys' bathroom, that we don't use, to find it next to the basin. your behaviour is nothing short of irresponsible and negligent. blame yourself when he goes under the knife. your genes and your neglect. he has been in your care for 5 days and you did not notice he wasn't wearing it. i have not seen him for 5 days, nor do i accept responsibility for what he packs.
you should be ashamed of yourself that you continue to put your children in this position. buy some uniforms. this is your responsibility not theirs.
she doesn't want to do swimming but is worried you’ll get angry
and the mother replied:
whatever...good story, mate. [ellipses in original]
... is [j's] bday and we have the boys that evening. given corona and social distancing it would be good for all the kids if they could spend a few hours together celebrating this. would you be able to swap an evening to facilitate this?
on the following three conditions. 1. you always make available any of the kids uniforms 2. you never ask for more costs on anything 3. your reply is a simple one-word yes to agree otherwise i’ll deem it a no to these conditions, and they’ll stay with me
the question you should be asking is whether your children would enjoy a few hours with their step brother on his birthday, given they have had no parties, no play dates, no school and no visits from extended families for...
i would like to have the kids wed june 23 so that we can get a direct flight to go away. can you exchange this school night for another? there are not many seats left so i would appreciate if you could get back to me
the father's response was as follows:
and i would like 50:50 shared care
i am asking to exchange a night so we can go on a family holiday, and not have to take 2 flights with 5 kids. are you saying no?
i am saying that if you agree to 50:50 shared care henceforth i will agree
i do not believe that 50:50 is in the children's best interests. your response is out of line and at the expense of what is a reasonable request.
expert evidence
... [the mother] organises, attends and pays for all the children's medical appointments. [the father] will make comments such as"/ will only take them if you pay for it". the only expense he has to pay as it is court ordered is the prescription medications. he is frustrated that he has to make his own appointment to get these scripts and feels she should provide the scripts she receives in her appointments to him. ... [the mother] will update [the father] after medical appointments, however she will get no acknowledgement for these messages. ... there is constant conflict regarding the school uniforms for both children. [the father] refuses to purchase a set of uniforms that can be stored at his house. the children are getting so stressed about this that [x] sent his father an email saying that he did not like it as carrying an extra bag on changeover days was hurting his back. ... [x] has also used his own pocket money to purchase uniform items for sports to keep at his father's house as his father wouldn't do this. ... [the mother] reported that there is also conflict regarding "the children" and their phones, [the father] will confiscate [x’s] phone as soon as he arrives at his house, and if "the children" are to text her there is no privacy. [the father] reads the messages she sends to "the children" and requires all the phone calls to be on speaker phone so he can listen. [x] is getting very frustrated at this as his social world involves messaging friends on the weekend which he is not allowed to do at his father's house. ... in regard to [the father’s] mental health, although there were no obvious issues during the interview process, the report writer did notice [the father’s] inability to understand the consequences of some of his actions, such as not responding to messages from [the mother], how charging uniforms to another person's account was not acceptable or the impact of not having uniforms at his house was having on "the children". if this matter does continue, a psychiatric assessment may be beneficial to rule out any underlying conditions for [the father]. ... [the father] feels that it is time for this extra time to be granted as it is better for the children to have both parents "equal" in their lives. ... [the father] agreed that [the mother] communicated about appointments and things like changes in medication for "the children", the report writer asked if the acknowledged these messages, to which he said "no". ... [the father] was very frustrated that [the mother] had not communicated with him about issues occurring in the household between her husband and his son. there were false allegations that he had been violent to his son, he had to seek the information from [mr f's] ex-partner. [the father] made comments that he needed the extra time to occur as he had safety concerns for "the children". the conversation got very confusing, [the father] agreed that the allegations against [mr f] were false, but then commented that because of the allegations and an undertaking now in place, his children were at risk of domestic violence. ... [the father] did display a lot of love for his children during the interview process and often got teary when speaking about them. ... [x] is 12 years old and in year 7 at [l school]. he spoke very confidently in his interview and the report writer believed his words to be his own and not influenced by another person. ... there are many issues occurring in the co-parenting of [x] and [y] and the report writer was very concerned at the impact this is having on them. maybe when they were younger, they were not concerned with things such as privacy and packing bags, but as they get older, they have concerns and their concerns are not being listened to. the communication between [the mother] and [the father] appears to be non-existent. [the father] is accusing [the mother] of being abusive in her messages however no evidence was presented in his affidavit material to verify this so the report writer can not confirm or deny these behaviours. either way, [the father] did agree that he will not acknowledge messages sent to him, yet he had complaints about some information such as absent school days not being provided to him. ... it is very obvious that [the mother] has had to take control of the medical needs of "the children", making the appointments, attending the appointments and paying for the appointments. [the father] had an understanding of the children's needs which has to of come from information being provided by [the mother]. the report writer is unsure as to why [the father] has made the decision to not meet or speak to some of the professionals who have been involved with "the children" for many years such as the psychologist, as information provided by specialists is important for both parents to understand. ... the report writer encourages [the father] to listen to "the children" in regard to their comments about the school holiday care when he is working and also in regard to allowing some more responsibility for his almost teenage son. the report writer understands why [the mother] is seeking sole parental responsibility for medical and schooling of "the children", if there cannot be any improvement in the communication between the parents, the report writer would not be opposed to this recommendation. ... the report writer felt that [x] and [y] were witnessing the conflict between the parents and recommended this cease immediately for their mental health and happiness. ... recommendations it is recommended that [x] and [y] live with their mother and spend time with their father five nights a fortnight in line with the current court ordered schedule. it is recommended that [x] and [y] spend half the school holidays with each parent and that even if their school holiday periods don't align they are not separated from each other. it is recommended that both parents have uniforms at each property for [x] and [y] to reduce the stress that has been occurring as a result of this. it is recommended that [x] and [y] contact the parent they are not with when they want to and that they are given privacy with this communication. it is recommended that conflict between the parents in front of [x] and [y] cease immediately. it is recommended that if [the father] does not improve his communication in the way of responding to [the mother] about medical and schooling information that a sole parental responsibility order be considered for [the mother]. [emphasis added]
