reasons for judgment
judge murdoch
introduction
background
the conduct of the hearing
the statutory regime n an application for leave under s 44(3), two broad questions may arise for determination. the first of these is whether the court is satisfied that hardship would be caused to the applicant or a child of the marriage if leave were not granted. if the court is not so satisfied, that is the end of the matter. if the court is so satisfied, the second question arises. that is whether in the exercise of its discretion the court should grant or refuse leave to institute proceedings...
evidence and submissions
consideration and determination
to refuse my application would significantly prejudice me, as [mr decks] has walked away from our relationship with a career and significant assets which were as a result of the significant financial and non-financial support i provided, whereas i only left with trauma as a result of significant family violence. ..... regardless of the situation at hand, all my monies is tied up in trust funds and are unable to be assessable.
in submissions the applicant stated that:
i have more money than [mr decks], iâ€™ve got three times more than [mr decks] has.
..we had little in the way of assets, the applicant had a block of land in tasmania and i had a car which i had financed and owed roughly $3000 and around $5000 worth of tools that i had paid for or had received as presents from friends and family.
he later deposes that:
at the time of our relationship ending, we had no assets therefore, there was no requirement for a property settlement.
and that:
since separation we have not cohabited or shared any financial resources.
i already had a car which my mother and father had purchased for me from my grandfather..

[1] pursuant to r 14.05 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 (cth) the application for review was to be filed within 21 days; that is by 31 august 2022. the court is given express power to extend or shorten any time fixed by the rules by making a procedural order (rule 15.06(1)) this power may be exercised even though the time fixed by the rules has expired (rule 15.06(2)).[2] this approach aligns with that adopted by the full court of the family court of australia (as it was then known) in neocleous & neocleous (1993) 113 flr 451; [1993] famca 44 where it was stated that applications to commence proceedings out of time should be summary in character and cross-examination is therefore often undesirable.[3] hall & hall (1979) flc 90-679; [1979] famca 50.[4] sharp v sharp [2011] famcafc 150; (2011) 50 fam lr 567; [2011] 50 famfacf 150[5] in the marriage of whitford [1979] famca 3; (1979) 24 alr 424; (1978) 35 flr 445; (1979)[6] in the marriage of mackenzie (1978) 34 flr 56; [7] carlon & carlon (1982) flc 92-272; [1982] famca 72.[8] gallo v dawson (1990) 93 alr 479; [1990] hca 30.[9] whitford (supra).[10] affidavit of ms balsom filed 17 april 2023, paragraph 15.
