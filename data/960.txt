reasons for judgment
judge blake:
background
position of the parties
the law
x’s best interests
meaningful relationship with both parents
need to protect the child from harm
‘i would hope that that would support her in accepting that decision and both settling in terms of her – her mental health but also her capacity or interest to potentially form other relationships in the new area. whether [mr kusic] would – would do that or not, i’m not certain. but it would be my hope that with encouragement and support of both parents that she would settle in addition to support from a psychologist as well to work through – through those hesitations or concerns for herself. but it would be my – my hope that that would occur.
x’s views
the extent to which parents have taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about long-term issues, to spend time with the child and to communicate with childthe capacity of each of the child’s parents to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needsthe attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents  the father told the court he has not contacted x’s school at all to check on her progress. despite this, he also told the court that he believes x is an above-average performer at school, attributes that performance to himself, and advocates a change of school for x, (b) the father told the court of an incident where x was bullied at school. he tendered a video of the bullying incident. despite his apparent concern about the incident, the father did not take any steps to speak to the school about it. the father’s evidence was that he felt that the mother should have spoken to the school about it, (c) the father says he wants x to attend school in the suburb b area either at m school, or n school. the father wants x to attend one of these schools because x has told him that that is what she wants. there is no evidence that he has conducted any proper assessment of the schools, or that he has considered the suitability of the schools to x’s particular needs, other than a vague assertion that he wants her to attend a christian school, (d) the father told the court of an incident where x had threatened self-harm. he says he attended the police station to pick her up, and made a statement. he says he subsequently told x that she must not harm herself because it was against her faith and religion. he said he took x to the doctor. he could not say, however, whether he had told x’s mother (the primary carer) about the incident, (e) the father told the court of another incident where x was threatening self-harm. he took her to the emergency department of suburb b hospital. a mental health plan was recommended for x. he subsequently took x to a general practitioner. despite taking these steps, and despite the natural fear a parent might have for seeing his child in this condition, he was unable to say whether he ever received a mental health plan for x, or obtained one. he also told the court that he did not tell the mother about the recommendation for x to receive a mental health plan so that she could manage things and monitor x, (f) the father told the court he has never spoken with mr f to check on x’s mental health. he told the court that he tried to contact mr f once, left a message with his secretary and never got a call back. that might be true (i have my doubts) but it is clear the father never pursued the discussion, (g) the father failed to provide consent to ms g to enable her to speak with mr f prior to ms g preparing the family report, (h) the father failed to tell ms g during the family report interviews that he had taken x to hospital because she had threatened to self-harm, (i) when asked what x and he did during their time together, the father stated, among other things, that x had recently had friends sleepover at his place. he told the court that when that occurs, he leaves the girls in the house alone at around 8.00 pm and sleeps at his factory which is nearby. questioned about this, his answer was ‘morality, all those fathers staying with the girls inside during the night’. asked whether he was concerned about leaving 13-year-old girls alone, he said ‘x has my trust’, and made no mention of the other 13-year-old girls that were present. asked whether the parents of x’s friends knew that he was absent overnight, he equivocated, speaking generally that he asks them, but then saying ‘i suppose that the girls tell them that i am sleeping in factory while they are staying with x’, (j) the father is led by x, rather than acting as a responsible parent. ms g noted in the family report that the father’s position in relation to time spent between the mother and x was aligned to x’s views and ‘did not appear to come from a position of parental responsive decision-making’, he stated: ‘i don’t care’, and ‘any time she wants’, referring to x’s wishes, which could include ‘every weekend’ and ‘every holiday’. ms g also stated at paragraph [54] of the family report the following: ‘[the father] was equally verbose when it came to his change of residency position, and whilst he proposed x to live with himself, this was prefaced by him stating ‘it’s all the same to me, if she feels the best place for her is to live with mother, i will agree. if she decides with me, i agree’. ms g also noted that ‘adolescence is still a very formative age and most 13, 14, and 15 year olds still need a high degree of parental care and responsibility to help guide them through their decision-making. they are in a stage of increasingly independent decision-making, but they do not necessarily make safe decisions for themselves’.   the father told the court of an incident where x was bullied at school. he tendered a video of the bullying incident. despite his apparent concern about the incident, the father did not take any steps to speak to the school about it. the father’s evidence was that he felt that the mother should have spoken to the school about it, (c) the father says he wants x to attend school in the suburb b area either at m school, or n school. the father wants x to attend one of these schools because x has told him that that is what she

because she had threatened to self-harm, (i) when asked what x and he did during their time together, the father stated, among other things, that x had recently had friends sleepover at his place. he told the court that when that occurs, he leaves the girls in the house alone at around 8.00 pm and sleeps at his factory which is nearby. questioned about this, his answer was ‘morality, all those fathers staying with the girls inside during the night’. asked whether he was concerned about leaving 13-year-old girls alone, he said ‘x has my trust’, and made no mention of the other 13-year-old girls that were present. asked whether the parents of x’s friends knew that he was absent overnight, he equivocated, speaking generally that he asks them, but then saying ‘i suppose that the girls

‘any time she wants’, referring to x’s wishes, which could include ‘every weekend’ and ‘every holiday’. ms g also stated at paragraph [54] of the family report the following: ‘[the father] was equally verbose when it came to his change of residency position, and whilst he proposed x to live with himself, this was prefaced by him stating ‘it’s all the same to me, if she feels the best place for her

parental care and responsibility to help guide them through their decision-making. they are in a stage of increasingly independent decision-making, but they do not necessarily make safe decisions for themselves’.   the father says he wants x to attend school in the suburb b area either at m school, or n school. the father wants x to attend one of these schools because x has told him that that is

assertion that he wants her to attend a christian school, (d) the father told the court of an incident where x had threatened self-harm. he says he attended the police station to pick her up, and made a statement. he says he subsequently told x that she must not harm herself because it was against her faith and religion. he said he took x to the doctor. he could not say, however, whether he had told x’s mother (the primary carer) about the incident, (e) the father told the court of another incident where x was threatening self-harm. he took her to the emergency department of suburb b hospital. a mental health plan was recommended for x. he subsequently took x to a general practitioner. despite taking these steps, and despite the natural fear a parent might have for seeing his child in this condition, he was unable to say whether he ever received a mental health plan for x, or obtained one. he also told the court that he did not tell the mother about the recommendation for x to receive a mental health plan so that she could manage things and monitor x, (f) the father told the court he has never spoken with mr f to check on x’s mental health. he told the court that he
