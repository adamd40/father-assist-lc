reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background he would be “disappointed” if a judge with “fresh eyes” does not recognise the previous family assessment reports are now outdated and such information is no longer relevant, and will consider it to be an “injustice”. she explained that the children did not express any concerns in relation to the father at five or six years of age, but have since done so, and as such, significantly less time with her will not be in their best interests. she added that both children have since made disclosures of concern to a range of sources (such as the australian federal police, their previous school, peers, and doctor) and will continue to run away if they remain primarily with father.[2]
whilst it is acknowledged, and agreed upon with [ms bruckner], that the children should be provided with opportunities to express their views, significant concern continues to be raised that the children’s views do not present as entirely their own, and remain inconsistent with their interactions with their father. as such, weight has not been given to the children’s expressed views in these circumstances. it is acknowledged that the children love their mother, and seek to spend time with her. given the nature of their entrenched views, and continued pressure to present the father in a negative light, however, it is believed that they require time to continue to focus upon the strengthening of their relationships with him, as well as time to internalise that they are allowed to love him and to enjoy time spent with him. it is considered crucial to focus on the father-child relationship at the present time, whilst the children are still at an age where they can continue to connect positively with him, before they move forward into their teenage years, when they are likely to become more independent in their views, or further influenced by other external factors. as such, it would seem appropriate for [x] and [y] to maintain telephone contact (supervised) with the mother at present, such as weekly, to occur at a specific time on a specific day (to work around with their other commitments) for a period of six months, as well as letters, cards or presents (such as in relation to the upcoming mother’s day), prior to consideration of face to face time-spending occurring in the future.[3]
the issues in the case
the issue of the children not regularly attending school was a matter of concern to the father and to the icl. it was at least one of the considerations as to why the final parenting orders were made, that provided for the father to have sole parental responsibility and also for the transition of the children from the primary care of the mother, to the primary care of the father. the concern raised by [dr dd], of his observations of the children’s extreme reluctance to now engage with the father and even their fear of returning to school lest the father attend and attempt to retake the children back into his care, is at stark odds with the evidence. i found that the evidence of the family consultant, in terms of the observations of the beneficial relationship between the children and the father, was such that the children presented without any concern after having spent time with him. the mother’s position that the children were fearful of the father, was not supported by the evidence generally or the specific evidence of the family consultant. ....... it is of concern that the mother would have resorted to taking the children to [dr dd]in circumstances where part of that issue related to the children not attending school and the mother not complying with the final parenting orders. they are matters to which sole parental responsibility would ordinarily have been a significant matter. i am not satisfied that the medical certificates provided by [dr dd] provide the explanation as to why the children have not been at school. what is behind that, is not the medical health of the children but rather the obvious understanding by the mother that were the children to attend their school, there would be then no impediment to the father collecting them pursuant to the final parenting order. the mother also had no confidence that the teachers and staff at the children’s school would do anything other than fall in with the father’s ability to have the final parenting orders complied with. it is also a relevant factor that, notwithstanding that the children have been in the sole care of the mother since 17 august 2022, no application was made to attempt to regularise the arrangement or to put in place a different arrangement. it is only the father’s initiating application that brings the mother to the court’s attention. what has now happened, is that there has been unilateral action taken by the mother to cause a change in the circumstances of the children without any regard to the effect that it would have on them. in circumstances where i made detailed findings as to the nature of the relationship between the children and their father, it is alarming that the mother should now have placed the children in the circumstance where they no longer have a relationship with him.[6]
the department has completed an investigation into the care afforded to [x] and [y] and has assessed that the children’s care arrangement with [mr merritt] is safe. the department is concerned that as of 31 january 2023 the children re-entered the care of [ms bruckner] and [ms bruckner] refused to cooperate with the department to have the children returned to [mr merritt]. to assist the court a detailed summary of the departmental investigation is attached.[15]
upon noting: a. justice kari has a conflict and is unable to hear the matter. the department for child protection (“dcp”) provided a response to the court pursuant to the s91b order made on 23 november 2022. such report is dated 1 february 2023. a copy of the dcp report dated 1 february 2023 was provided to the independent children's lawyer (“icl”) and the court shall provide a copy of the same to each the mother and the father by email at the conclusion of today’s hearing. the icl has advised the court today that she has made appointments for the parties to attend upon [ms h] for the purposes of the family assessment ordered on 21 december 2022, with the first of such appointments scheduled for 8 march 2023. the icl has indicated to the court that the father has responded to the icl’s request to contribute one half of the costs of [ms h’s] report but as yet the mother has not yet done so noting that the mother indicates that she has not received any communications from the icl in that regard. that the court has been advised by the icl and the parties today as to the following circumstances in relation to the children: both children attended school on friday, 3 february 2023. the child [y] was returned to the father’s primary care on 3 february 2023. the child [x] has remained in the mother’s primary care. neither of the children have attended school since 3 february 2023. the icl is concerned that the children are not attending school and they are not spending time with each other and/or communicating with each other. the dcp have not yet determined whether they intend to take up the court’s request to intervene in the proceedings. either way: the dcp intend to continue to actively engage with the family during the period of the adjournment. the dcp have requested that the mother personally and otherwise facilitate the child [x] engaging with the dcp. that the father has made appointments for both children to see a psychologist on 10 february 2023 and the dcp are concerned to the court orders by consent: that all extant interlocutory applications do stand dismissed in particular the interim orders sought in the father’s initiating application filed on 19 october 2022 and the interim orders sought by the mother in the application in a proceeding filed on 25 november 2022. that no later than 4.00pm on 10 february 2023 the father do file and serve an application in a proceeding setting out the interim orders he now seeks together with any affidavit in support. that no later than 4.00pm on 14 february 2023 the mother do file and serve a response to the father’s application in a proceeding to be filed pursuant to these orders setting out the interim orders she now seeks together with any affidavit in support. that no later than 4.00pm on 14 february 2023 the mother do file and serve a response to the father’s initiating application filed on 19 october 2022 setting out the final orders she now seeks. that the icl file and serve any affidavit upon which they rely no later than 4.00pm on 15 february 2023. the court further orders: pursuant to s 69zw of the family law act 1975 south australia police shall provide the court with the following documents or information from the date of any previous production up to and including the present day: copies of any reports or notifications of child abuse allegations or allegations of family violence involving either of the parties [mr merritt] (born 1970) and [ms bruckner] (born 1974) or the infant children [x] (born 2012) and [y] (born 2014), and the outcome or findings of any such investigations including antecedent reports for each of the parties.
noting that upon production of the material from south australian police and subject to any requests by them, the parties and/or their legal representatives consent to a chambers order issuing for the parties to inspect only and the legal representatives to inspect and copy the material. pending further order, the parties are restrained and injunction is granted restraining them from issuing a subpoena to south australian police. pursuant to s 69zw of the family law act 1975 the department for child protection provide the court with the following documents or information from the date of any previous production up to and including the present day: copies of any notifications regarding abuse allegations arising or relating to the children [x] (born 2012) and [y] (born 2014), b. any assessments or investigations into such abuse allegations, the outcome or findings of any such assessments and investigations, and copies of any reports received by the department for child protection in the course of investigating any such notifications. noting that upon production of the material from the department for child protection and subject to any requests by the department, the parties and/or their legal representatives consent to a chambers order issuing for the parties to inspect only and the legal representatives to inspect and copy the material. pending further order, the parties are restrained and injunction is granted restraining them from issuing a subpoena to the department for child protection. that the dcp be at liberty to inspect and copy the court file in these proceedings. that paragraph 4 of the orders made by justice mead on 23 november 2022 be discharged. that paragraph 10 of the orders made by justice mead on 21 december 2022 be discharged. that both parties be restrained and an injunction is granted restraining both parties from communicating directly with the judge’s chambers. that the mention hearing before the honourable justice mead listed on 15 february 2022 be vacated. that the proceedings be listed before a judge other than justice berman or justice kari as a matter of urgency with a request that if possible the matter be heard on a face-to-face basis.
her honour: ‑ ‑ ‑ 1 february. all right. i am going to make an order, or a notation, that i will release that document by email to each you and [mr merritt] at the conclusion of today’s hearing so that you have that document. otherwise, can i understand this, and just give me one moment. [mr merritt], you filed – just stand up for me, please. you filed a fresh initiating application in the matter in october of last year. that application in part had a focus of the recovery order which his honour then dealt with. otherwise i think the balance of the orders have been dealt with in terms of the reappointment of the independent children’s lawyer and some other issues. but there are other orders in that document which have never been dealt with that you seek. i am also conscious that the mother filed an application in a proceeding in november which also hasn’t formally been dealt with. in terms of how i procedurally manage the matter, what i am inclined to do – and there are two options as to how i deal with it. but i think i will do because those applications are now old, both yours and the mother’s from november – and i am addressing this to you as well, [ms bruckner]. because those documents are old and there has been a considerable change of – and series of events since then, what i am inclined to do, [mr merritt], is require you to file – and i will work out the timeframe in a moment, but a fresh application in a proceeding setting out the interim orders you’re asking the court to make, together with an affidavit in support, and you can update the court as to all that has occurred in the intervening period. i will then require the mother to file a response to that application in a proceeding, together with her affidavit in support, where she can put the material that she wants before the court. the plan then will be to dismiss all previous outstanding interim applications and there will just be the fresh applications that are filed pursuant to the orders i propose to make today. you’re nodding your head. you seem to follow that. [mr merritt]: i – sorry, your honour. yes. her honour: are you content with that procedural course of action? [mr merritt]: yes, your honour her honour: all right. thank you, [mr merritt]. have a seat. [ms bruckner], you’ve just heard my explanation as to the procedural orders i plan to make. are you content with that course of action, to bring the matter up to date so that each, you and [mr merritt], have the opportunity to put the documents that you want before the court so that a judge can hear, whatever the current orders are, an argument in relation to the current orders that you are each asking the court to make. [ms bruckner]: that makes sense, your honour, to do that, and i also would just like to put forward that i seek to issue a subpoena, your honour, and i was hoping that we could do that in these procedural orders as well.[16]   only ran from the school and hurt her foot on the 3 february 2023 because she was being chased by [ms ae] from dcp and others. [ms ae]'s actions and the children being unnecessarily pulled out of class are the reason [x] got upset and ran from school and nearly ran into a car. [x] said she was happily in class prior to her being pulled out of class and sent to the office. the mother contacted the principal and he confirmed that he had no control over dcp pulling the kids out of class and doing what they did.[19]
the nature of an interim hearing
decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing.
the assessment of risk is one of the many burdens placed on family law decision makers. risk assessment comprises two elements – the first requires prediction of the likelihood of the occurrence of harmful events, and the second requires consideration of the severity of the impact caused by those events. in our view, the assessment of risk in cases involving the welfare of children cannot be postponed until the last piece of evidence is given and tested, and the last submission is made. we accept, however, that it is always a question of degree depending on the evidence that is before the court.
apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.
legal principles relating to parenting proceedings
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[33]
parental responsibility
how the court applies these principles in the context of an interim hearing
the dcp report of 1 february 2023
on 31 january 2023, the department received a notification that [x] and [y] absconded from school grounds and that [x] asked another student ‘can you bring my bag down to my mums house after school’. [ms bruckner] later phoned the school advising that the federal police had advised her to communicate the children’s whereabouts and confirmed the children were in her care. [ms bruckner] also alleged that [y] had diarrhoea. also on this date, the department received a further child protection notification outlining that police attended [ms bruckner]’s property and sighted both [x] and [y] in her care. police reportedly met with [ms bruckner] and her friend who insisted that they record the entire interaction. it was reported that the children appeared influenced by [ms bruckner] and their responses ‘came across scripted’. [ms bruckner] made allegations that [y] appeared underweight however the notification indicates police held no concerns for the children’s physical presentation. the notification outlined that [ms bruckner] was ‘controlled yet confrontational with police and extremely persistent in giving her side of the story’. at approximately 5:00pm on 31 january 2023, the department attended [ms bruckner]’s home. upon arrival [ms bruckner] presented as combative and expressed that she was unwilling to speak with departmental workers unless she had another person present. [ms bruckner] refused to open the front screen door, would not allow departmental workers to sight the home and also appeared to be recording departmental workers on her mobile phone. the department explained that [ms bruckner] is currently contravening federal court orders and there are concerns in relation to the children remaining in her care. [ms bruckner] made comments that she is aware of what the allocated departmental worker has been saying to the children. when asked to elaborate on this [ms bruckner] alleged that the departmental worker told [x] ‘it doesn’t matter what you say no one will listen’. the departmental worker advised this comment was never made to [x] and advised that the department need to sight the children. [ms bruckner] proceeded to call both [x] and [y] to the front door and stated to [x] ‘is this the lady you were telling me about’. [ms bruckner] then proceeding to say to [x] in a forceful manner ‘tell the lady what you told me before, tell her’. [x] appeared to hesitate and unsure what [ms bruckner] was referring to and the departmental worker advised [ms bruckner] that this discussion is not appropriate to have in front of the children. [ms bruckner] then stated ‘no [x] is old enough to hear this’. [ms bruckner] continued pressuring [x] to speak to the departmental workers and [x] recalled that in response to her comments about wanting to kill herself the departmental worker responded ‘i’m sorry to hear that’. department worker confirmed this was the response given to [x]. the department went on to advise that they need to conduct a safety check of the home including sighting the children’s bedrooms. [ms bruckner] became further heightened at this stating that the department need a court order to complete this and slammed the door on workers. the department assessed that further attempts to interact with [ms bruckner] on this day would only serve to expose the children to further conflict. the department remains in support of justice mead’s decision to place the children in [mr merritt]’s primary care and are concerned for [x] and [y]’s emotional wellbeing should they remain in [ms bruckner]’s care. concerns exists in relation to [ms bruckner]’s inability to ensure the children’s school attendance and is unlikely to facilitate the children’s engagement with a psychologist for an appointment booked on 10 february 2023 (arranged by [mr merritt]). [ms bruckner]’s presentation on 31 january 2023, further indicates she has no regard for the children’ emotional safety and actively seeks to involve the children in inappropriate conversations. the department recommends that [x] and [y]’s return to the care of [mr merritt] and further recommends that [mr merritt] is allowed to change the children’s school enrolment to embed the children’s support network within the safety of the fathers care environment and area.[39]  he department accepts the honourable court’s position in relation to [ms bruckner] and the risk she poses to [x] and [y]’s emotional and psychological safety therefore would not be supportive of the children being in [ms bruckner]’s care. in particular the department has significant concerns in relation to [ms bruckner]’s inability to meet the children’s education and health needs as outlined within the judgement dated 27 october 2022. further to this, the department is concerned that, [x] in particular, appears fixated with painting [mr merritt] and [ms f] in negative light and views this likely as a result of [x]’s exposure to [ms bruckner]’s own views of the father’s household. the department currently has no concerns in relation to the level of care provided by [mr merritt] and [ms f] to [x] and [y]. issues raised by [x] and [y] during their interviews appear to stem from their relationship being fractured potentially by the narrative provided to them by [ms bruckner]. concerns raised by [x] revolve around food issues, [mr merritt] drinking wine and not assisting [x] with her sleep. these issues do not constitute as child protection concerns and the department considers that [mr merritt] and [ms f] are well equipped to re-build a trusting relationship with both [x] and [y]. the department has observed [mr merritt] and [ms f] to remain child focussed and genuinely interested and concerned about the children’s welfare. it is the department’s recommendation that before time spending is reinstated between the children and [ms bruckner], that [ms bruckner] participate in a psychiatric mental health assessment. the department considers information from such assessment is best placed to inform decisions around contact arrangements. the department’s concern, which is mirrored by [mr merritt], is that should [ms bruckner] be granted contact with [x] and [y], [ms bruckner] may withhold the children resulting in further emotional harm or seek to disrupt the children’s stability with [mr merritt]. the department supports the honourable court’s assessment and finding that ‘the best interest of the children would be served by them remaining in the primary care of the father’. the department will support the honourable court in the change of care environment back to [mr merritt] where possible. the department also considers it important that [mr merritt] be allowed to re-enrol the children into a local area school.[40]
ms ag’s report and evidence  acknowledged that it was good to speak with [ms bruckner] recently, but was clear that she would prefer to see her in person. she also reasoned that if the children were told the date when they will see her again, they would have something to look forward to, and would be happier if aware of when it will occur. [x] was also keen to know when they will return to [ms bruckner], and expressed some frustration that no-one has been able to answer this for her.[41]   would like to see [ms bruckner]“tomorrow” and to stay with her “forever”. when asked about when he would see his father, y said “maybe later”. [y] acknowledged he worries “a lot” about [ms bruckner], such as about “how she’s feeling”, and whether she is feeling “sad and worried” about them. he acknowledged he and [x] ran away from school after “dad was being really mean” by “screaming at us”. he was unable to recall why his father had screamed, but recalled feeling “angry” and missing [ms bruckner] at this time. he said that no-one had encouraged him or [x] to run away.[42]
as with x, it was y’s position that the children alone who had initiated leaving school on 31 january 2023, which had subsequently precipitated the involvement of dcp with the family.  he will follow court orders, and will tell the children they must spend time with the father, as ordered, even if they do not want to go.[43]   and [y] presented as settled when they attended the registry childcare area with [mr merritt]. [y] explored pretend play activities whilst [x] remained close to [mr merritt]. he reassured her that everything would be okay and told her he would return soon. [x] commented, “yay!” in response to him returning soon, and gave him a warm hug, reciprocated by him, before he left whilst [y] remained in the pretend play area. when [mr merritt] returned to collect the children, [y] exclaimed, “dad!” excitedly, and immediately ran and jumped up onto him and hugged him, with [mr merritt] holding him up and returning the affection. [x] bounced on a fitball and asked her father to pull her up, which he did by her arm. she stood close to him, and he affectionately patted her arm, to which she responded positively. the brief interactions between the children and [mr merritt] presented as comfortable, relaxed and natural.[44]
during interview, [x] and [y] continued to voice negative views of [mr merritt], and they both presented as unable to acknowledge anything positive about him, or about their time with him. this is in direct contrast to the brief informal observations of their interactions with him in the childcare area, which presented as comfortable, warm, and natural. in addition, whilst the children raised concern about their father and stepmother, such as [y] reporting that the father yells, or [x] reporting that the stepmother tries to act in a motherly way by checking she is okay when hurt, this did not seem to be outside of what may be considered fairly standard parenting. the children also did not provide very detailed accounts in their negative descriptions of their father. whilst [y] commented that his father becomes “drunk”, he did not provide examples of behaviour consistent with this view. the writer was led to query the potential of negative influence by the mother, consistent with prior information from multiple sources (such as previous family assessment report, dcp information, past judgments). in addition, concern was raised with regard to the extent in which this may have occurred, given the fixed nature of the children’s responses, when they have had limited contact with their mother recently.[45]
as such, future time-spending between [ms bruckner] and the children is likely to be contingent upon the positive progress of such therapy, in addition to the positive progress of telephone calls during this time. it is also considered that if, or when, time-spending recommences in the future, it occurs supervised (at least initially), to ensure that [ms bruckner]’s responses to the children remain child-focussed and appropriate.[46]
legal principles relating to the disqualification of the icl
once it is understood that the icl’s primary responsibilities and duties as a legal practitioner (albeit a legal practitioner charged with onerous, particular responsibilities) remain essentially the same as all legal practitioners appearing before this court, it can be seen to follow that an icl is perfectly at liberty to, and probably obliged to, argue firmly and fearlessly for what they contend are findings or results consistent with the best interest of the particular children they represent in their particular circumstances - provided always, of course, that each and every such submission is founded upon evidence properly and adequately put before the court. within that rubric, the fact that an icl has a “view” about a particular matter or issue, does not necessarily bring with it a finding of partiality. indeed, it is frequently the duty of an icl to come to a view contrary to that contended for on behalf of a party if, in their proper, considered, professional judgment, the evidence points to such a conclusion. in those circumstances, submissions of the icl, and things said by the icl, will, perhaps almost inevitably, have the appearance of partiality because, frequently enough, the views thus expressed are likely to accord with the position of one of the parents and not the other (although, it needs to be emphasised, that this is, of course, not necessarily so).[48]
the independent children’s lawyer is, immediately upon appointment, in an invidious position. he or she is obliged to look beyond the assertions and counter assertions advanced by children’s conflicted parents (and others). in doing so, he or she is presuming, by dint of statutory and other responsibilities, to interfere, to one degree or another, with what can be seen to be a basic right: the right of a parent to parent his or her child in the way they best think fit. yet, when parents, through their conflict or the nature and extent of assertions one makes against the other, abdicate to the court decisions about the best interests of their children, views other than their own, including the views of an icl can, and in the case of the court will, intervene. in that situation, rights and considerations relevant to a determination of best interests enshrined in the act predominate, as do duties owed to the court by an icl. the obligation upon an icl to act objectively and impartially should not be seen as meaning that he or she should act as a benign or ambivalent mouthpiece for competing evidence. frequently, doing so can involve an abdication of their proper professional responsibilities.
it would be an intolerable situation if a party could successfully apply to have a child represented removed simply because that party perceived that the representative was not ‘on side’ or the tide was not running in his or her favour.[50]
the critical question in considering an application to remove a child's representative is whether the representative is likely to carry out his or her task properly ... it might well be appropriate to remove a child's representative where the evidence showed that he or she had deliberately misled the court or behaved in unethical or unprofessional ways. it might also be appropriate to remove a child's representative where circumstances arose giving rise to reasonable apprehension that the child representative would not deal with the matter impartially. such circumstances might cast doubt on the ability of the child's representative to "act in an independent and unfettered way in the best interests of the child. it is appropriate to note in this connection that it is frequently part of the child's representative's role to advance propositions which will be seen by one party as contrary to that party's interests and/or contrary to the child's interests. differences of views are of course inevitable in litigation. while a child's representative should be removed if there are proper reasons for doing so, it would be quite wrong for a court to remove a child's representative merely because a litigant has taken the view that the child's representative is acting contrary to that litigant's position, or (from that litigant's point of view) contrary to the child's best interests. i agree with the child representative's submission that it is important to avoid a situation in which the child representative "is a captive or the most vocal, litigious or dissatisfied parent or party.[52]
...in relation to an independent children’s lawyer the appearance of bias may be tested by whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children’s lawyer might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the task of independently representing a child.[54]
the test that i shall apply is that the father needs to establish that the independent children's lawyer actually lacks impartiality or alternatively, a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children's lawyer lacks impartiality. that test of perceived lack of impartiality however, is to be judged having regard to the role and duties imposed upon the independent children's lawyer by s 68la of the act. that “rubric” is discussed by murphy j at [41] – [61] of knibbs where his honour sets out, amongst other things, the duty of the independent children's lawyer to argue firmly and fearlessly for what the independent children's lawyer contends are findings or results consistent with the best interests of particular children and describes the precarious position an independent children's lawyer is in when fulfilling that role because it may be that the independent children's lawyer is required to challenge the position of one or other of the parents.[56]
