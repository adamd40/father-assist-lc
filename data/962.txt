reasons for judgment
judge young
whether or not the explanation provided by [mr granden], that [x] slipped and fell, could result in a [fracture].
it seems that [x]’s father, [mr granden], says that the injury occurred when x slipped over whilst running on the back [play area], and that [x] was in an awkward position on the ground when [mr granden] turned around.
falls whilst running are a well-reported cause of fractures in this toddler age group, and if there is any twisting component to the fall (for example, a foot turning inwards during the fall), the fracture is likely to be [a break]. this does not, however, exclude the possibility of an inflicted injury.
acting manager case work received an update from detective senior constable [name redacted]. during the conversation, the following was discussed: police have interviewed [mr granden], and at this stage will not be proceeding with a criminal investigation pending the skeletal scan which is meant to be occurring today. [mr granden] provided an account of what was happening prior to [x] sustaining the injury. [mr granden] stated he and x had been to [e store] earlier in the day to purchase a [some play equipment]. [mr granden] stated they returned home, and he and [x] were on the back [play area] at his house, and he was erecting [the play equipment]. [mr granden] stated he had his back to [x], and when he turned around, [x] was on the floor, so he did not witness what happened to [x]. police have organised to attend [mr granden]’s home to sight the [premises] and [the play equipment], to confirm [mr granden]’s explanation.
‘screened out’ serious non-accidental injury.   given the nature of the injury, the f hospital conducted an appropriate medical examination of the child, including a skeletal scan, which revealed no other evidence of bony injury consistent with any history of abuse. (2) the police interviewed the father and accompanied him to his home and examined the home to see whether what they observed was consistent with the father’s explanation for the child’s injury. it appears, also, that a child welfare worker may have accompanied the police, however that is a little bit unclear. certainly, there was an indication that that was intended. (3) the child welfare authorities obtained an expert medical opinion, presumably from a doctor or an orthopaedic surgeon within the hospital – again, it is somewhat unclear – as to whether the mechanism of injury described by the father, that is, the child slipping on a wet play area, was plausible and the advice was that was plausible, and indeed, in children that age, a broken bone suffered while running and falling was not uncommon, and further, if there was some degree of twisting in the fall, that could result in a fracture. the upshot of that was that the matter was taken no further.   the police interviewed the father and accompanied him to his home and examined the home to see whether what they observed was consistent with the father’s explanation for the child’s injury. it appears, also, that a child welfare worker may have accompanied the police, however that is a little bit unclear. certainly, there was an indication that that was intended.

my opinion regarding how he sustained a [fracture] – it would be most likely that non-accidental injury requiring a reasonable amount of force, such as being thrown, involved in a car accident, or dropped from a greater than one-metre height, could cause this fracture. [fracture]s require force not able to be generated by small children. in my medical training, a [fracture] of the [leg] in a child was always explored (sic) a source of non-accidental injury, involving force and not a child play accident.  acture]s require a force not able to be generated by small children.
assessments indicate child/young person is not in need of care and protection.  ty f] joint child protection response program have finalised the field assessment for [x]. physical abuse could not be substantiated throughout the assessment, and future risk is assessed as low. case closure endorsed [names of case workers].
