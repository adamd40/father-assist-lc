overview
the hearing
factual background
during sessions, when the therapist has set a challenge, such as an obstacle course, and asked [x] to repeat the instructions back to her, [x] has been noted to enter a heightened state of arousal resulting in refusal and crying. despite improvements, [x] can be impulsive and seeks control of activities, reducing his ability to concentrate and attend to the task at hand. he requires prompting to wait for activities to be explained before beginning.   presents with a number of complex comorbid conditions and has experienced and continues to experience a number of possibly traumatic family events that may be impacting on his behaviour. these factors should be taken into consideration when developing therapy and learning plans to support [x]’s ongoing development.
analysis
and just so you’re aware, that ratty gf you think you know all about [this is a reference to the father’s current partner] has always looked after her and supported her kids with the job. very different from you. can’t even keep a job. yes, you do. you won’t make an agreement. what was your offer, [ms haywood]? you can’t control them. you constantly ring and message me, asking me to help you because [x] isn’t doing what you want. clearly, you’re not capable of parenting but care more about your centrelink and child support than the kid’s best interest lol because you see my car apparently means i’m available. sorry, you do not dictate my life, and i’m not your babysitter. i make plans for when “you” decided i could have my kids, which is every second weekend, so if you want to change it, more than happy to see your suggestions. otherwise, do not ring and message me daily with your issues.   has informed me that [mr kiesel] used to hit her when she was in his care, leaving marks. i’m concerned this may have happened to [y], given his strong desire not to go anywhere near [mr kiesel]. [y] won’t even make eye contact with [mr kiesel] anymore. i’m aware that [u] sees a therapist due to issues with [mr kiesel]. [mr kiesel] told [u] if she wanted to see the boys, it had to be through him to try and manipulate her into seeing him. when [mr kiesel] became aware i had taken the boys to [ms v]’s –  s mother]
