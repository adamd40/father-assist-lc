reasons for judgment
judge jenkins
introduction
brief history
equal shared parental responsbility
determining best interests
the primary considerations
meaningful relationship
given [x’s] age and stage of development, it is likely that a positive relationship could be maintained with a non- residing parent in a different state in australia. the relationship would be maintained by regular telephone/video communication during the week and substantial time during school holiday periods.
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
risk  s] historic and continued exposeure [sic] to the father’s domestic violence and drug and alcohol abuse places him at a high risk in the father’s care and has had and will contionue [sic] to have a highly detrimental effect on [x].
drug use
family violence
the department’s investigation
the additional considerations
x’s wishes
the nature of the relationship with x and each of his parents  presented as having a significant attachment to [ms whitlock]. this would be consistent with his attachment history with respect to [ms whitlock] having been his primary caregiver.
during the visits [x] interacted candidly with the departmental workers and was eager to show his toys. [x] happily recounted fishing trips and visits to the local park with [mr howerton]. during the visit, [x] was observed to seek out [mr howerton] for reassurance and spontaneous hugs. [x] was observed to approach [mr howerton] to have his needs met and, [mr howerton] was observed to respond appropriately to [x] such as helping him set up his remote control car, and to provide a drink. [x’s] school, [r school] and, service provider [s services], report that [x] is well supported by [mr howerton] in both regular and consistent attendance and scaffolding [x’s] learning. the school and [s services] report that [mr howerton] is interested in [x’s] progress and actively seeks feedback in order to support [x] further. (as per the original)
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances
the practical difficulty
ability to meet x’s needs
...highly engaged with the service ensuring that [x] consistently attends appointments. the speech pathologist stated that [mr howerton] regularly contacts the service to check on [x’s] progress and to request feedback. it is reported that [mr howerton] extends [x’s] speech therapy by continuing to work with [x’s] goals in the home environment. (as per the original)   howerton] has clear consistent daily routine and structure on how he cares for [x], it has predictability and procedural function, he understands how to meet [x’s] needs that is child focussed for him to thrive in his home environment, school and community. [mr howerton] has a good understanding of co-parenting challenges and has welcomed all types of learning that would benefit him in his circumstances. he has attended sessions with the goal of increasing his knowledge on communication skills, domestic violence, alcohol and other drugs, mental health with the intent to increase positive outcomes of respectful behaviour that is supportive of the co­parent relationship and is able to identify co-parenting challenges in a variety of ways when discussing family matters. (as per the original)  s] communication abilities continue to be affected greatly by his difficulties with his emotional regulation. when [x] becomes dysregulated, he will often become upset and hide under a blanket and/or yell and scream with aggressive behaviours e.g. throwing items, hitting. these periods of dysregulation can be triggered by anything from having to hop off the phone to a book not ending how he expected it to. sometimes these periods will be brief and [x] can be redirected to activities while other times [x] cannot be redirected or re-engaged in the session. (as per the original)
