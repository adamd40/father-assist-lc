the law
the test for reasonable apprehension of bias is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the decision-maker might not have brought an impartial and unprejudiced mind for the resolution of the question to be decided: ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy (2000) 205 clr 337...a two-step process is involved. the first requires the identification of what is said that might lead the decision-maker to decide the case other than on its merits. the second requires the articulation of a logical connection between the suggested reason and the feared deviation from that course. see ebner at [8]. a finding of apprehended bias is not to be reached lightly. the contrary it must be “firmly established” see re jrl, ex parte cjl. (1986) clr 39 at 352 (mason j), at 364 (wilson j), 371 (dawson j). there must be “strong grounds” for inferring the existence of a reasonable suspicion: re jrl, ex parte cjl at 359-360 (wilson j)...
