issues for determination
issue 1: x’s time with his parents during school terms and school holidays
issue 2: whether the parties' superannuation interests should be dealt with in a separate pool?
in summary, then, the trial judge has a discretion as to how superannuation interests will be treated in a particular case. if superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to:   value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties' property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.
in the context of a consideration of the matters referred to in sub-paragraph (b) and (c) of the last paragraph, the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation, actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse's present and/or future entitlements under the fund.[110]
issue 3: whether the parties' contributions to the non-superannuation pool should be regarded as equal
issue 4: whether there should be an adjustment in percentage terms to the respondent for matters set out in s 75(2)?
issue 5: whether the applicant should pay the respondent spousal maintenance?
issue 6: should orders be made to ensure that the respondent retains the property at d street, town e?
standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
parenting
parenting orders: the law
x’s best interests: the s 60cc factors
section 60cc(2)(a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents
what these definitions convey is that "meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[120]
it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[121]   presents as having a close bond and relationship with both his parents. [x] clearly enjoys spending time in both homes and he presents as having only positive feelings around his relationships and the level of connection he has established with the family members in both homes.[122]
section 60cc(2)(b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
this will give [x] the greatest opportunity to maintain meaningful relationships with the parents and provide him with the greatest protection from the conflict and negative dynamic advanced by the father. the father, to cope with week about, will require engagement with intensive targeted family therapy and restrictions on his communications about his own negative and hostile thoughts to enable him to rebuild positive attitudes to the mother's parenting.[124]
section 60cc(3)(a): any views expressed by the child, and the weight to be accorded to those views given their age and level of maturity
the terms of s60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child’s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child’s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child’s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court to these matters.[125]
towards the end of the appointment, once [x] presented as feeling more comfortable and less guarded, i asked [x] to consider how he would feel if it was decided that he could spend equal amounts of time with his mum and dad, he said “okay”. when asked to consider how he would feel if it was decided that his current living arrangements would not change, he said, “okay”. [x] appeared to be genuinely nonplussed when considered both these options. although he could not provide further reasoning or information in relation to this issue, his body language (smiling, thumbs up) indicated that he appeared to be relaxed and comfortable when considering either of these options for his living arrangements.[126]
section 60cc(3)(b): the nature of the relationship of the child with each of their parents
section 60cc(3)(c): the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child
section 60cc(3)(ca): the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child
section 60cc(3)(d): the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect to the child from any separation from either of their parents
section 60cc(3)(e): the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time and communicating with a parent
section 60cc(3)(f): the capacity of each of the child’s parents to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
section 60cc(3)(g): the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background of the child and each of the child’s parents
section 60cc(3)(h)): if the child is aboriginal or torres strait islander
section 60cc(3)(i): the attitude to the child and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the parents
section 60cc(3)(j): any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family
section 60cc(3)(k): if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter.
section 60cc(3)(l): whether it would be preferable to make orders that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
section 60cc(3)(m): any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.
parenting plans
parental responsibility
equal time or substantial and significant time?  how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[135]
equal time
given that [x] has a close relationship with both parents and considering that both parents present as being highly motivated and capable of meeting [x’s] needs, it is recommended that [x] has the opportunity to spend equal amounts of time in both homes. given the parents’ commitment to providing [x] with the stability, routine and structure that is necessary for him to thrive, it is expected that [x] is likely to have the capacity to transition to an equal shared care arrangement. his adhd symptoms are currently very well managed with the use of medication and adherence to the routines and strategies that are implemented within both his homes.[136]
substantial and significant time  for the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend substantial and significant time with a parent only if: (a) the time the child spends with the parent includes both:   the time the child spends with the parent includes both:  days that fall on weekends and holidays, and (ii) days that do not fall on weekends or holidays, and (b) the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in: (i) the child's daily routine, and (ii) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child, and (c) the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:  ) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child, and (c) the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.

section 75(2)(o): any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account
in considering whether the justice of a case requires some act done by a party to be taken into account under s.75(2)(o), the court should, we think, have regard primarily to the existence or otherwise of any legal obligations, as between the parties, in relation to the doing of that act, and also, perhaps, to ordinary notions of justice and equity between the parties. in this case, the applicant had a legal duty to maintain the children of her prior marriage, which duty had primacy over the duty of any other person, other than the children's respondent, to so maintain them: ss.66a and 66b of the act. the respondent, on the other hand, had no legal duty to maintain these children at any time during the marriage because, by s.66g, a step-parent has such a duty only if he or she is a guardian of the child, or has custody of the child by an order of a court, or a court having jurisdiction under part vii of the act by order determines that it is proper for the step-parent to have that duty. none of those pre-conditions existed in this case. accordingly, in contributing to the support of these children the applicant was merely honouring a legal obligation which she owed to the children, whilst the respondent, in making his contribution, was acting essentially as a volunteer assisting the applicant in the discharge of her legal obligations. upon that basis, whilst we consider the justice of the case clearly required the respondent's contribution to be taken into account under s 75(2)(o), the same cannot be said of the applicant's contribution. in making that contribution the applicant was in no way discharging or assisting to discharge any legal obligation of the respondent.”[171]

conclusion regarding the parties' superannuation entitlements
final assessment: a just and equitable exercise of discretion?
... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[177]
spousal maintenance
spousal maintenance: the law
in lee steere and lee steere [1985] famca 57, (1985) flc 91-626 the court viewed the exercise that is required in proceedings under sec. 79 as incorporating two steps. firstly the ascertainment of contribution and then the consideration of the relevant matters set out in sec. 75(2). it is the combined application of the past contributions and the sec. 75(2) elements that bring a court to make an order that is just and equitable within the meaning of sec. 79. an order for maintenance, be it periodic or by way of lump sum, which is intended to be caught by the provisions of sec. 66l, 77a and 87a is something that is looked at generally after the sec. 79 matters have been attended to. it may require an additional transfer of property or payment of lump sum over and above the proposed order which has already been arrived at by the application of sec. 79 principles. (emphasis added)
a party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first-mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately... (a) by reason of having the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, (b) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment, or (c) for any other adequate reason,
that threshold is whether the applicant “is unable to support herself or himself adequately” by reason of the matters set out in (a), (b), or (c) of that section, but having regard to any relevant matter referred to in sub-section 75(2). thus, the question of whether the applicant can support herself “adequately” is not to be determined by reference to any fixed or absolute standard but having regard to the matters referred to in s 75(2) and more specifically the paragraphs of that sub-section identified above. nor is that question to be determined upon a “subsistence” level, as earlier cases under state maintenance legislation suggested. in nutting and nutting (1978) flc 90-410 at 77, 094 lindenmayer j said:-
“by sec. 72 of the act, the respondent is liable to maintain the applicant only to the extent that she is incapable of supporting herself adequately, and again ‘adequately’ imports a standard of living which is reasonable in the circumstances, including the circumstances that the parties are no longer husband and wife and that the assets and resources which were formerly available to them both in common have now been divided between them.” (emphasis added)
1. a threshold finding under s72, 2. consideration of s74 and s75(2), no fettering principles that pre-separation standard of living must automatically be awarded where the respondent’s means permit, and discretion exercised in accordance with the provisions of s 74 with “reasonableness in the circumstances” as the guiding principle.[181]
is the respondent unable to support himself adequately?
is the applicant reasonably able to pay maintenance?
