"we note that the home presented in a somewhat neglected condition from the street with a lack of general maintenance being carried out. the home would benefit from a general painting. there were no signs of damage to the house and given a coat of paint and general replant and watering of the garden the appeal of the home could be brought back to a good standard. we did note some rubbish items left around the front of the house which detracts from the overall appeal."

“52. the treatment of property already distributed and exhausted prior to trial, usually called “add backs”, has been the subject of many authorities in this court. in ajo & gro [2005] famcafc 104, (2005) flc 93-218 at [30] , following kowaliw & kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 and townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 (“townsend”), the full court held that add backs fall into “three clear categories”. where [sic] the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and “waste” or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets. this latter category indicates that the nature of the expenditure of post-separation or premature distributions can be relevant to the exercise of discretion to add back. ... 58. in our view, these authorities establish four relevant propositions. first, adding back property which has been distributed and spent is discretionary, and reflects an exceptional exercise of the discretion as an “accounting” or “balance sheet” exercise for the purposes of ss 79(2) and (4) to achieve justice and equity between the parties. secondly, the nature of the expenditure reflected in add backs is relevant, and reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of add back. thirdly, the decision in stanford [(2012) 247 clr 108, [2012] hca 52], followed by bevan[(2014) flc 39 – 572, [2014] famcafc 19], does not necessarily require the conclusion that adding back notional property is per se an error, but proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property. fourthly, in cases which are not exceptional, expended interim distributions can be taken up under s 75(2) rather than as part of the balance sheet exercise.”   drawing against the mortgage over the property at f street, suburb h in an amount of $35,000 by the time of his trial affidavit of 4 october 2022 with a further $25,000 to be drawn in a similar manner later that month, and (b) selling shares to raise funds to pay legal fees giving rise to a capital gains liability of $3,222.   selling shares to raise funds to pay legal fees giving rise to a capital gains liability of $3,222.

should provide an incentive for the de facto wife to proceed with the sale of suburb c as quickly as practicable and so immediate payment will not be required. rather, the payment of the sum of

do so, the suburb e property will need to be sold and the de facto wife to retain the proceeds of that sale. in making such an order the court is conscious that the evidence of the de facto husband is brought forward as to the de facto wife’s borrowing capacity being limited and that a sale of the suburb e property would see the de facto wife then in need of obtaining alternative accommodation. the court could delay, until the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the suburb c property, the transfer of the suburb e property from the joint names of the parties to the de facto wife’s sole name

property which would otherwise be available to the wife (together with the payment of $32,700 due to the de facto wife by the de facto husband) so as to lessen the amount which she may need to borrow on any refinancing of the suburb e property mortgage. for such a course to be adopted, there would need to be the payment of the mortgage instalments over the suburb e property which remain in the

wishes to preserve his credit rating. the de facto wife should be granted a period of about 2 months to permit her to further explore the prospects of refinancing the mortgage over the suburb e property for the purposes of facilitating the transfer of said suburb e property into her sole name. should she fail to do so the suburb e property will also need to be sold so as to bring to an end the parties’ financial commitment in respect of its mortgage. in the event that the de facto husband pays the mortgage instalment on behalf of the parties during the period running from this judgment to the date of settlement upon any sale of the suburb e property he should be reimbursed any payment that he so makes on behalf of the parties.   for the proceeds from the sale of the suburb c

remaining balance of proceeds from the sale of the suburb c property to be distributed as to 52.5% to the de facto wife and, subject to a charge for the payment of $32,00 referred to below, 47.5% to the de facto husband.  i) for the remaining balance of proceeds from the sale of the suburb c property to be distributed as to 52.5% to the de facto wife and, subject to a charge for the payment of $32,00 referred to below, 47.5% to the de facto husband.   that upon the payment of the assessed capital gains tax liability of the de facto wife the de facto husband pay to the de facto wife the sum of $32,700. it is open to the court to determine that the de facto husband make the payment immediately – he having the funds available in the transaction account ending ...16 to do so – but the delay in the receipt of monies from the de facto husband should provide an incentive for the de facto wife to proceed with the sale of suburb c as quickly as practicable and so immediate payment will not be required. rather, the payment of the sum of $32,700 should be made no later than when the de facto husband’s share of the proceeds of the suburb c property are due to be distributed to him. if the balance of the suburb c proceeds due to the de facto husband are insufficient for him to make that payment he shall have to find monies elsewhere to do so, (d) that the de facto husband do retain for his sole use and benefit and/or keep the de facto wife indemnified (where necessary) in relation to the suburb h property, the mortgage loan over the suburb h property, his motor vehicle 1, the balance of the transaction account ending ...17, the balance of the transaction account ending ...16, his j financial services transaction account, his furniture and effects, his shares, g financial services credit card and j financial services credit card. the de facto husband will also remain responsible for the capital gains tax liability arising from the sale of shares which he has made for the purposes of funding his legal fees, (e) that the de facto wife do retain the sole use and benefit and/or keep the de facto husband indemnified (where necessary) in relation to the suburb e property, the mortgage over the suburb e property, her motor vehicle 2, the transaction account ending ...17, the m financial services account ending ...20, the commonwealth bank account ending ...94 and the furniture and effects in her possession including a diamond ring, and (f) to give effect to the above order, the de facto wife will need to organise for the de facto husband to transfer to the de facto wife his interest in the suburb e property which is registered in the joint names of the parties and the de facto wife will need to refinance the mortgage over that property. should it be the case that the de facto wife is unable to do so, the suburb e property will need to be sold and the de facto wife to retain the proceeds of that sale. in making such an order the court is conscious that the evidence of the de facto husband is brought forward as to the de facto wife’s borrowing capacity being limited and that a sale of the suburb e property would see the de facto wife then in need of obtaining alternative accommodation. the court could delay, until the receipt of the proceeds from the sale of the suburb c property, the transfer of the suburb e property from the joint names of the parties to the de facto wife’s sole name and the consequent refinancing by the de facto wife of the existing mortgage liability. this would have the effect of permitting the de facto wife to use the net proceeds from the sale of the suburb c property which would otherwise be available to the wife (together with the payment of $32,700 due to the de facto wife by the de facto husband) so as to lessen the amount which she may need to borrow on any refinancing of the suburb e property mortgage. for such a course to be adopted, there would need to be the payment of the mortgage instalments over the suburb e property which remain in the joint names of the parties. the de facto wife despite residing in the property has not met all of the mortgage instalments as they have fallen due and the de facto husband has paid some of them as he wishes to preserve his credit rating. the de facto wife should be granted a period of about 2 months to permit her to further explore the prospects of refinancing the mortgage over the suburb e property for the purposes of facilitating the transfer of said suburb e property into her sole name. should she fail to do so the suburb e property will also need to be sold so as to bring to an end the parties’ financial commitment in respect of its mortgage. in the event that the de facto husband pays the mortgage instalment on behalf of the parties during the period running from this judgment to the date of settlement upon any sale of the suburb e property he should be reimbursed any payment that he so makes on behalf of the parties.   that the de facto husband do retain for his sole use and benefit and/or keep the de facto wife indemnified (where necessary) in relation to the suburb h property, the mortgage loan over the suburb h property,
