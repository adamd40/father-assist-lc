signed by the parties [90g(1)(a)]  ms f witnessing the husband’s signature does not impact on whether the financial agreement is binding based on the following: (i) the husband’s signature on october 2011 was witnessed by ms f, a worker at the husband’s business. (ii) ms f placed the initials jp after her signature. (iii) subsequent enquiries by the wife revealed that that at the time the document was witnessed by ms f, ms f’s appointment as a justice of the peace had expired. (iv) it is not a requirement of the legislation that the financial agreement, in order for it to be binding, is sworn or affirmed or needs the signature of a jp. (v) as is the common law practice, provided the signature to a deed is witnessed by an adult (someone over the age of 18) then there is no issue as to who can witness a signature. (vi) as ms f was over 18 then she was a valid witness, whether or not her jp status was current. (vii) i therefore find that this is not an issue which impacts on whether the financial agreement is binding. (b) the wife was aware that the husband had signed the financial agreement based on the following: (i) the wife maintains that it was not until december 2021 that the wife became aware of the financial agreement having been signed by the husband with the husband having informed the wife verbally on or around october 2011 that the husband had not signed the agreement. (ii) i do not accept the wife’s version of events for the following reasons: (a) the wife was aware that the husband and his family required a financial agreement to be entered into by the parties prior to their wedding in 2011. (b) why would the parties jointly attend an appointment to enquire about a financial agreement if it was never the intention of the husband to go through with it? (c) why would the parties go to the expense of having their own lawyers if it was not the intention of the husband to proceed with the financial agreement? (d) why would the husband insist on amendments to the financial agreement if the husband never intended to sign it? (e) why did the wife keep a copy of the financial agreement in her folder if the wife thought it was no longer relevant? (f) mr e completed the declaration in 2011 after the parties had returned to australia from country g. (g) why would that occur if the husband had no intention of going ahead with the financial agreement? (h) ms c subsequently received the original document in 2011 when the wife was back in australia. (i) there is no reason why ms c would not have informed the wife as to the signed financial agreement and in accordance with the legislation provide a copy of the completed financial agreement to the wife. (j) the subsequent enquiries by the wife of d lawyers as to the file resulted in: the wife being informed by the receptionist that only the husband was listed as a client in the system and the wife being provided with a copy of the financial agreement signed only by the wife. unfortunately there was no affidavit filed by the receptionist as to how it was ascertained who was the client and where the copy came from when the hard file had been destroyed years before. mr b informed the wife that the hard file had been destroyed. the destruction of the hard file would not have extended to the destruction of the original financial agreement which was sent to d lawyers by e lawyers in december 2011. lawyers are well aware as to the importance of retaining such a document and the necessity of keeping it in a safe place. there is no evidence as to what has happened to the original document. as the wife was their client the only explanation is either the original financial agreement is still at the offices of d lawyers in their safe custody (with no evidence that a search of the safe custody has taken place) or that at some point the document was collected by the wife. either scenario would result in the wife having been aware of the executed document. (k) in any event the wife was aware after commencing legal proceedings in july 2018 as to the existence of the signed completed financial agreement as her then solicitor told the wife about the bfa and that the husband was not pressing the bfa. (l) again an affidavit (or subpoena for the giving of evidence) to her then solicitor would have assisted as i struggle to understand how experienced solicitors acting for both parties would have been so dismissive as to such an important document and why no mention of this incident appeared in either party’s affidavits leading up to this issue being the subject of a discrete hearing. (m) the other burning question which places in doubt the wife’s version of events is why the wife did not mention the bfa (whether binding or not) to her initial lawyers at the time of giving her instructions for the initiating application or any subsequent affidavits. (n) as to whether the husband told the wife something contrary as to what happened leading up to the wedding is neither here or there as the wife became aware of the signed financial agreement through her lawyers, i find, on or around december 2011. (o) i find that the wife was aware that the financial agreement had been signed by the husband who had obtained independent legal advice.   the husband’s signature on october 2011 was witnessed by ms f, a worker at the husband’s business.

(j) the subsequent enquiries by the wife of d lawyers as to the file resulted in: the wife being informed by the receptionist that only the husband was listed as a client in the system and the wife being provided with a copy of the financial agreement signed only by the wife. unfortunately there was no affidavit filed by the receptionist as to how it was ascertained who was the client and where the copy came from when the hard file had been destroyed years before. mr b informed the wife that the hard file had been destroyed. the destruction of the hard file would not have extended to the destruction of the original financial agreement which was sent to d lawyers by e lawyers in december 2011. lawyers are well aware as to the importance of retaining such a document and the necessity of keeping it in a safe place. there is no evidence as to what has happened to the original document. as the wife was their client the only explanation is either the original financial agreement is still at the offices of d lawyers in their safe custody (with no evidence that a search of the safe custody has taken place) or that at some point the document was collected by the wife. either scenario would result in the wife having been aware of the executed document. (k) in any event the wife was aware after commencing legal proceedings in july 2018 as to the existence of the signed completed financial agreement as her then solicitor told the wife about the bfa and that the husband was not pressing the bfa. (l) again an affidavit (or subpoena for the giving of evidence) to her then solicitor would have assisted as i struggle to understand how experienced solicitors acting for both parties would have been so dismissive as to such an important document and why no mention of this incident appeared in either party’s affidavits leading up to this issue being the subject of a discrete hearing. (m) the other burning question which places in doubt the wife’s version of events is why the wife did not mention the bfa (whether binding or not) to her initial lawyers at the time of giving her instructions for the initiating application or any subsequent affidavits. (n) as to whether the husband told the wife something contrary as to what happened leading up to the wedding is neither here or there as the wife became aware of the signed financial agreement through her lawyers, i find, on or around december 2011. (o) i find that the wife was aware that the financial agreement had been signed by the husband who had obtained independent legal advice.
independent legal advice [90g(1)(b)]  the husband did not receive legal advice from d lawyers (i) there is no evidence before the court to suggest that mr b or any other solicitor at d lawyers had previously acted for either party prior to the parties’ appointment with mr b in september 2011. (ii) both parties attended the appointment with mr b in september 2011 to enquire about how to obtain a financial agreement. (iii) the appointment before mr b in september appeared to be an information gathering session about the parties’ financial affairs. (iv) this is demonstrated by the husband’s following answers in cross-examination:   there is no evidence before the court to suggest that mr b or any other solicitor at d lawyers had previously acted for either party prior to the parties’ appointment with mr b in september 2011. (ii) both parties attended the appointment with mr b in september 2011 to enquire about how to obtain a financial agreement. (iii) the appointment before mr b in september appeared to be an information gathering session about the parties’ financial affairs. (iv) this is demonstrated by the husband’s following answers in cross-examination:  ) both parties attended the appointment with mr b in september 2011 to enquire about how to obtain a financial agreement. (iii) the appointment before mr b in september appeared to be an information gathering session about the parties’ financial affairs. (iv) this is demonstrated by the husband’s following answers in cross-examination:  i) the appointment before mr b in september appeared to be an information gathering session about the parties’ financial affairs. (iv) this is demonstrated by the husband’s following answers in cross-examination:  ) this is demonstrated by the husband’s following answers in cross-examination:
counsel: you sat in the appointment together? husband: yes counsel: mr b was the person that both you and her saw? husband: yes counsel: and you accept that, during that meeting, you did the majority of speaking on your and my clients behalf? husband: yes counsel: and that, during that conference, you were asked by mr b on you and your wife’s financial position? husband: yes counsel: and you answered for both of you husband: incorrect... counsel: okay. you answer for you, do you say? husband: correct... counsel: okay. now you gave instructions to mr b to draft a binding financial agreement, didn’t you? husband: i asked him advice on getting a financial binding agreement. counsel: and he gave that advice? husband: correct.   there is no evidence that apart from discussing the contents needed for the preparation of a financial agreement and the process of getting a financial agreement that legal advice was given to either party at this interview as to the impact, advantages or disadvantages of the financial agreement. (vi) subsequent to the appointment the wife chose to use the services of d lawyers in the preparation of the financial agreement and the husband chose to use mr e from e lawyers as his legal representative. (vii) i find that at no time did d lawyers act for both parties in the same or related matters and therefore this is not a matter where reg 11 legal profession uniform law australian solicitors’ conduct rules (nsw) applies. (viii) likewise the decision of rees j in bachman & donohoe [2021] fedcfamc1f 240 is also not applicable. in that matter where it was held that independent legal advice had not been given, it was clear that the lawyer was involved with one of the parties (as a friend and part owner of a boat), had acted for one party in the preparation of a will, had given advice to both parties in respect to a property transfer and refinance, had subsequently given legal advice to both parties resulting in the drafting of a financial agreement and it was only shortly before signing that financial agreement that one of the parties was referred to another lawyer for independent advice. this is a very different fact scenario to this matter where the lawyer did not know the parties, had not acted previously for the parties, the joint appointment was information sharing and gathering only and that after the appointment and prior to the preparation of the agreement the wife had chosen d lawyers to retain as her lawyer and the husband had chosen e lawyers as his lawyers. (ix) it was only after the parties had chosen to obtain their own lawyers that the financial agreement was prepared by the wife’s lawyers and subsequently amended at the insistence of the husband’s lawyers. (x) advice as to financial agreement was then provided to the wife and the husband by their respective lawyers. (xi) i therefore find that the husband had never been in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers about the financial agreement and therefore there was no conflict in d lawyers acting for the wife in respect to the financial agreement. (b) the wife did receive independent legal advice in respect to the financial agreement (i) the wife does not dispute that she was in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers but denies that such advice was independent. (ii) the parties had been in discussion about having a financial agreement drawn up prior to marrying. (iii) the wife was aware that the husband’s family together with the husband wanted the financial agreement because of the financial discrepancy between the parties. (iv) no matter who chose the lawyers or how the booking came about for the parties to attend upon d lawyers, the wife knew of the appointment (as evidenced by her diary entry in her 2011 day timer) and the purpose of the appointment. (v) i accept the husband’s evidence that during the joint initial consultation the parties were each informed that they would each require their own legal representation if they wished to proceed with the financial agreement. (vi) i accept the wife’s evidence that the joint initial consultation, which according to the wife who had a nail appointment (as noted in her 2011 day timer) at 3.30pm to 4.00pm, would have only lasted until then and that during that time a series of questions were asked by mr b, mostly of the husband, as to their financial situation. (vii) i accept the evidence that at the initial joint consultation with mr b the wife chose to stay with d lawyers for the purposes of the preparation of the financial agreement. (viii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that she did not instruct d lawyers to prepare the draft financial statement. (ix) the wife is an educated and intelligent woman who was aware that the husband and his family required that a financial agreement be entered into prior to the wedding. (x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation. (xii) within days of the initial joint consultation mr b provided a draft of the financial agreement to the husband which was subsequently provided to the husband’s solicitor mr e at e lawyers. (xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife’s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit “i sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b” [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011. (xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit “i do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]”. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated “my level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both” [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband’s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife’s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement. (xxix) if ms c had not done so, ms c would not have signed the requisite certificate. (xxx) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the contents of the financial agreement when the wife had read the draft, had been spoken to about the amendments, had signed the document and had kept a copy of the financial agreement in her possession since october 2011. (xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement. (c) the nonexistence of a cost agreement and the who paid the account is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding (i) the wife cannot recall receiving or signing a costs agreement from d lawyers. (ii) the hard file of d lawyers is no longer in existence, having been destroyed after 7 years. (iii) the best evidence that exists is a copy of a tax invoice rendered to the wife by d lawyers for $1,540. (iv) there is no evidence that the account was disputed. (v) the account was subsequently paid. (vi) as to who actually paid the account is irrelevant as it was issued to the wife and then paid. (vii) i find that how the account came about and how it was paid is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding.  ) subsequent to the appointment the wife chose to use the services of d lawyers in the preparation of the financial agreement and the husband chose to use mr e from e lawyers as his legal representative.

(viii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that she did not instruct d lawyers to prepare the draft financial statement. (ix) the wife is an educated and intelligent woman who was aware that the husband and his family required that a financial agreement be entered into prior to the wedding. (x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation. (xii) within days of the initial joint consultation mr b provided a draft of the financial agreement to the husband which was subsequently provided to the husband’s solicitor mr e at e lawyers. (xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife’s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit “i sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b” [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011. (xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit “i do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]”. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated “my level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both” [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband’s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife’s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement. (xxix) if ms c had not done so, ms c would not have signed the requisite certificate. (xxx) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the contents of the financial agreement when the wife had read the draft, had been spoken to about the amendments, had signed the document and had kept a copy of the financial agreement in her possession since october 2011. (xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement. (c) the nonexistence of a cost agreement and the who paid the account is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding (i) the wife cannot recall receiving or signing a costs agreement from d lawyers. (ii) the hard file of d lawyers is no longer in existence, having been destroyed after 7 years. (iii) the best evidence that exists is a copy of a tax invoice rendered to the wife by d lawyers for $1,540. (iv) there is no evidence that the account was disputed. (v) the account was subsequently paid. (vi) as to who actually paid the account is irrelevant as it was issued to the wife and then paid. (vii) i find that how the account came about and how it was paid is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding.  ) it was only after the parties had chosen to obtain their own lawyers that the financial agreement was prepared by the wife’s lawyers and subsequently amended at the insistence of the husband’s lawyers. (x) advice as to financial agreement was then provided to the wife and the husband by their respective lawyers. (xi) i therefore find that the husband had never been in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers about the financial agreement and therefore there was no conflict in d lawyers acting for the wife in respect to the financial agreement. (b) the wife did receive independent legal advice in respect to the financial agreement (i) the wife does not dispute that she was in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers but denies that such advice was independent. (ii) the parties had been in discussion about having a financial agreement drawn up prior to marrying. (iii) the wife was aware that the husband’s family together with the husband wanted the financial agreement because of the financial discrepancy between the parties. (iv) no matter who chose the lawyers or how the booking came about for the parties to attend upon d lawyers, the wife knew of the appointment (as evidenced by her diary entry in her 2011 day timer) and the purpose of the appointment. (v) i accept the husband’s evidence that during the joint initial consultation the parties were each informed that they would each require their own legal representation if they wished to proceed with the financial agreement. (vi) i accept the wife’s evidence that the joint initial consultation, which according to the wife who had a nail appointment (as noted in her 2011 day timer) at 3.30pm to 4.00pm, would have only lasted until then and that during that time a series of questions were asked by mr b, mostly of the husband, as to their financial situation.

(xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement. (c) the nonexistence of a cost agreement and the who paid the account is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding (i) the wife cannot recall receiving or signing a costs agreement from d lawyers. (ii) the hard file of d lawyers is no longer in existence, having been destroyed after 7 years. (iii) the best evidence that exists is a copy of a tax invoice rendered to the wife by d lawyers for $1,540. (iv) there is no evidence that the account was disputed. (v) the account was subsequently paid. (vi) as to who actually paid the account is irrelevant as it was issued to the wife and then paid. (vii) i find that how the account came about and how it was paid is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding.   the wife does not dispute that she was in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers but denies that such advice was independent. (ii) the parties had been in discussion about having a financial agreement drawn up prior to marrying. (iii) the wife was aware that the husband’s family together with the husband wanted the financial agreement because of the financial discrepancy between the parties. (iv) no matter who chose the lawyers or how the booking came about for the parties to attend upon d lawyers, the wife knew of the appointment (as evidenced by her diary entry in her 2011 day timer) and the purpose of the appointment. (v) i accept the husband’s evidence that during the joint initial consultation the parties were each informed that they would each require their own legal representation if they wished to proceed with the financial agreement. (vi) i accept the wife’s evidence that the joint initial consultation, which according to the wife who had a nail appointment (as noted in her 2011 day timer) at 3.30pm to 4.00pm, would have only lasted until then and that during that time a series of questions were asked by mr b, mostly of the husband, as to their financial situation. (vii) i accept the evidence that at the initial joint consultation with mr b the wife chose to stay with d lawyers for the purposes of the preparation of the financial agreement. (viii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that she did not instruct d lawyers to prepare the draft financial statement. (ix) the wife is an educated and intelligent woman who was aware that the husband and his family required that a financial agreement be entered into prior to the wedding. (x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation. (xii) within days of the initial joint consultation mr b provided a draft of the financial agreement to the husband which was subsequently provided to the husband’s solicitor mr e at e lawyers. (xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife’s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit “i sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b” [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011. (xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit “i do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]”. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated “my level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both” [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband’s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife’s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement. (xxix) if ms c had not done so, ms c would not have signed the requisite certificate.

(xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit “i do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]”. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated “my level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both” [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband’s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife’s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement. (xxix) if ms c had not done so, ms c would not have signed the requisite certificate. (xxx) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the contents of the financial agreement when the wife had read the draft, had been spoken to about the amendments, had signed the document and had kept a copy of the financial agreement in her possession since october 2011. (xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement.  i) i accept the evidence that at the initial joint consultation with mr b the wife chose to stay with d lawyers for the purposes of the preparation of the financial agreement. (viii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that she did not instruct d lawyers to prepare the draft financial statement. (ix) the wife is an educated and intelligent woman who was aware that the husband and his family required that a financial agreement be entered into prior to the wedding. (x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation. (xii) within days of the initial joint consultation mr b provided a draft of the financial agreement to the husband which was subsequently provided to the husband’s solicitor mr e at e lawyers. (xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife’s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit “i sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b” [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife’s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011.

$2,645,000.00   the husband in annexure a made misrepresentations as to the following assets and liabilities: (i) extent of the husband’s equity in h street, town j (a) the husband acquired the title to h street, town j (h street, town j) in september 2011, one month before the execution date of the financial agreement. (b) it is not in dispute that as at the date of the financial agreement, h street, town j was valued at $365,000 which reflected the purchase price paid by the husband. (c) the husband however stated in annexure a that the mortgage to anz (mortgage) over h street, town j was $30,000, which inferred that the husband had equity in h street, town j in the sum of $335,000. (d) however the husband states in the trial affidavit that the mortgage was the difference between the purchase price of $365,000 and the deposit of $50,000 [9]. (e) therefore as at october 2011 the mortgage was $315,000 (and not $30,000 as indicated by the husband) and the husband’s equity was $50,000 and not the sum of $335,000 as reflected in annexure a. (f) the husband therefore misrepresented the extent of his equity in h street, town j. (ii) value of company k, country g (a) the husband in annexure a values company k of country g (company k) with its equipment and liquid assets at $950,000. (b) in addition under the separate heading of “assets” the husband includes silver bonds of $220,000 and gold bonds of $1,300,000 (the bonds). (c) how the husband came to these figures has not been addressed by the husband in his trial affidavit. (d) during cross-examination the following emerged: the bonds were not separate but formed part of the assets of company k. the $950,000 figure was incorrect as the bonds should have been included in the value of company k. the husband said that he calculated the value of the bonds by looking at their current value in 2011 although no explanation was given as to what that actually entailed and the husband admitted that he did not know the number of bonds held by company k. (e) the husband therefore misrepresented the true value of company k. (f) as it unclear as to what the true value of company k was, it is not possible to ascertain the total net assets. (iii) ownership of company k (a) a reading of the financial agreement and annexure a indicates that the husband was the sole owner of company k. (b) the husband’s trial affidavit states however that “the country g assets in which i have an interest were owned with my brother, mr l (mr l), namely... an interest in a business, the company k of country g of which, in 2011, i was a director and shareholder, and... gold and silver bonds, which were assets of the company k” [27]. (c) however in cross-examination the following emerged: the husband’s brother (the brother) was the sole person who established company k at a time when the husband was living overseas. the husband’s only hands on involvement with company k was to help out the brother when he was visiting country g doing such things as answering the phone, cleaning the floors or locking up. in 2006 or 2008 the brother transferred for “no money” company k (together with the interest in the bonds) to the husband. the reason for the transfer was to protect the brother’s assets from any liabilities, provide possible tax breaks to the brother and to take the brother’s assets as he was going through some legal problems. as a consequence of the transfer the husband became the sole director and sole shareholder of company k. the husband had no difficulty with the transfer as he felt that he owed the brother because of the extent of the financial support the brother had provided when the husband was studying. the husband was aware that whilst the transfer resulted in the husband being the legal owner of company k, there was no financial benefit for the husband as he was holding company k on behalf of the brother to protect the brother. this continued to be the situation when the husband entered into the financial agreement in october 2011. the husband maintained that he had informed mr b that on paper company k belonged to the husband. from 2006 or 2008 until the return of company k to mr l in 2013 the husband received “no money” from company k. in 2013 the husband for “no money” transferred his interest in company k and the bonds back to the brother. the transfer took place because by that time the brother was no longer in a position where the brother feared losing his assets and the husband was in a position where as a non-resident of country g there were “astronomical” tax implications in country g if the husband was to continue to be involved in company k. (d) the financial makes no reference to this arrangement between the husband and the brother as to company k (the arrangement). (e) i do not accept that the arrangement was discussed adequately with mr b because if it had been then it would have been reflected in the financial agreement. (f) further there is no evidence that the husband raised the arrangement with mr e. (g) again mr e would have ensured that the arrangement was reflected in the financial agreement. (h) the inclusion of the arrangement was not one of the amendments sought by the lawyers for the husband to the financial agreement in september 2011. (i) i find that the husband misrepresented the arrangement when providing instructions to his lawyers in respect to the financial agreement and therefore misrepresented in the financial agreement that the husband had an entitlement of any nature to the assets of company k including the bonds. (j) as the husband had no financial entitlement to company k or the bonds, then these items should never have been included in annexure a as property owned by the husband. (iv) loan of $200,000 (a) an explanation as to this loan is not contained in the financial agreement. (b) an explanation as to this loan is not contained in the husband’s trial affidavit. (c) the husband in cross-examination was adamant that company k was acquired by the husband for no money, that the husband did not receive any money when company k was in his name and that no money was received when company k was transferred back to the brother. (d) an explanation as to this loan was not the subject of cross-examination. (e) i find that in the absence of any evidence to support a legitimate loan of $200, 000, that the husband misrepresented the existence of this loan. (f) this amount should therefore have not been included in annexure a. (d) the wife had no comprehensive knowledge of the arrangement and i make this finding based on the following: (i) i accept from the evidence that the wife has very limited knowledge as to the assets and liabilities that the husband supposedly held as at the date of the financial agreement. (ii) the husband admits that at the joint consultation with d lawyers, it was the husband that answered the bulk of the questions about the parties’ financial affairs. (iii) it is clear from the wife’s trial affidavit that the wife held no understanding as to the arrangement between the husband and the brother. (iv) i accept that the wife’s attempts to extract information from the husband as to his financial affairs and in husband’s interest in the brother’s business were unsuccessful leading up to the preparation of the financial agreement. (v) the husband in cross-examination was vague as to whether he had informed the wife as to the arrangement in regard to company k, or his financial situation using such phrases as: (a) “i’m sure we’ve had a discussion that i had assets in country g” (b) “it would have been raised” (c) “we would have had discussions” (d) “i would have said” (vi) the husband’s vagueness continued in the following exchange between the bench and the husband during cross examination:   extent of the husband’s equity in h street, town j (a) the husband acquired the title to h street, town j (h street, town j) in september 2011, one month before the execution date of the financial agreement. (b) it is not in dispute that as at the date of the financial agreement, h street, town j was valued at $365,000 which reflected the purchase price paid by the husband. (c) the husband however stated in annexure a that the mortgage to anz (mortgage) over h street, town j was $30,000, which inferred that the husband had equity in h street, town j in the sum of $335,000. (d) however the husband states in the trial affidavit that the mortgage was the difference between the purchase price of $365,000 and the deposit of $50,000 [9]. (e) therefore as at october 2011 the mortgage was $315,000 (and not $30,000 as indicated by the husband) and the husband’s equity was $50,000 and not the sum of $335,000 as reflected in annexure a. (f) the husband therefore misrepresented the extent of his equity in h street, town j. (ii) value of company k, country g (a) the husband in annexure a values company k of country g (company k) with its equipment and liquid assets at $950,000. (b) in addition under the separate heading of “assets” the husband includes silver bonds of $220,000 and gold bonds of $1,300,000 (the bonds). (c) how the husband came to these figures has not been addressed by the husband in his trial affidavit. (d) during cross-examination the following emerged: the bonds were not separate but formed part of the assets of company k. the $950,000 figure was incorrect as the bonds should have been included in the value of company k. the husband said that he calculated the value of the bonds by looking at their current value in 2011 although no explanation was given as to what that actually entailed and the husband admitted that he did not know the number of bonds held by company k. (e) the husband therefore misrepresented the true value of company k. (f) as it unclear as to what the true value of company k was, it is not possible to ascertain the total net assets. (iii) ownership of company k (a) a reading of the financial agreement and annexure a indicates that the husband was the sole owner of company k. (b) the husband’s trial affidavit states however that “the country g assets in which i have an interest were owned with my brother, mr l (mr l), namely... an interest in a business, the company k of country g of which, in 2011, i was a director and shareholder, and... gold and silver bonds, which were assets of the company k” [27]. (c) however in cross-examination the following emerged: the husband’s brother (the brother) was the sole person who established company k at a time when the husband was living overseas. the husband’s only hands on involvement with company k was to help out the brother when he was visiting country g doing such things as answering the phone, cleaning the floors or locking up. in 2006 or 2008 the brother transferred for “no money” company k (together with the interest in the bonds) to the husband. the reason for the transfer was to protect the brother’s assets from any liabilities, provide possible tax breaks to the brother and to take the brother’s assets as he was going through some legal problems. as a consequence of the transfer the husband became the sole director and sole shareholder of company k. the husband had no difficulty with the transfer as he felt that he owed the brother because of the extent of the financial support the brother had provided when the husband was studying. the husband was aware that whilst the transfer resulted in the husband being the legal owner of company k, there was no financial benefit for the husband as he was holding company k on behalf of the brother to protect the brother. this continued to be the situation when the husband entered into the financial agreement in october 2011. the husband maintained that he had informed mr b that on paper company k belonged to the husband. from 2006 or 2008 until the return of company k to mr l in 2013 the husband received “no money” from company k. in 2013 the husband for “no money” transferred his interest in company k and the bonds back to the brother.  ) value of company k, country g (a) the husband in annexure a values company k of country g (company k) with its equipment and liquid assets at $950,000.

(b) an explanation as to this loan is not contained in the husband’s trial affidavit. (c) the husband in cross-examination was adamant that company k was acquired by the husband for no money, that the husband did not receive any money when company k was in his name and that no money was received when company k was transferred back to the brother. (d) an explanation as to this loan was not the subject of cross-examination. (e) i find that in the absence of any evidence to support a legitimate loan of $200, 000, that the husband misrepresented the existence of this loan. (f) this amount should therefore have not been included in annexure a.   the wife had no comprehensive knowledge of the arrangement and i make this finding based on the following: (i) i accept from the evidence that the wife has very limited knowledge as to the assets and liabilities that the husband supposedly held as at the date of the financial agreement. (ii) the husband admits that at the joint consultation with d lawyers, it was the husband that answered the bulk of the questions about the parties’ financial affairs.

(iv) i accept that the wife’s attempts to extract information from the husband as to his financial affairs and in husband’s interest in the brother’s business were unsuccessful leading up to the preparation of the financial agreement. (v) the husband in cross-examination was vague as to whether he had informed the wife as to the arrangement in regard to company k, or his financial situation using such phrases as: (a) “i’m sure we’ve had a discussion that i had assets in country g” (b) “it would have been raised” (c) “we would have had discussions” (d) “i would have said” (vi) the husband’s vagueness continued in the following exchange between the bench and the husband during cross examination:   i accept from the evidence that the wife has very limited knowledge as to the assets and liabilities that the husband supposedly held as at the date of the financial agreement.

judge: can you recall whether there was any specific discussions with the wife about this issue, because obviously your mother and your brother were aware of the arrangements in place in respect to company k and the bonds? husband: correct judge: so can you recall specifically any discussions that you had with the wife about this particular issue prior to the binding financial agreement? husband: yes. i would have discussed this issue with my wife. judge: well can you recall specifically...? husband: i can -i can... judge: because again you’re saying coming “would have”? husband: i can remember our first meeting with mr b. we have to discuss these assets... judge: okay. but prior to that first meeting where you’re discussing it, not with the wife, but discussing it with the lawyer, did you discuss it with her prior to that? husband: yes. judge: when? i need you to recollect. i don’t want you to... husband: it would have... judge: speculate? husband: i can’t recall the exact date, but it would have been within a six-month period before the wedding after we had gotten engaged, probably shortly after my brother or mother bought it to my attention, so maybe 3 months before marriage judge: in those discussions, was the wife aware of the set up between you and the brother? husband: yes judge: that these assets didn’t really belong to you, you were just holding them to protect you? husband: correct. she would have. judge: are you saying she would have been aware of that time she executed this document? husband: yes.  i) the husband admitted in cross examination that: (a) that the conversation with the wife about the arrangement “wasn’t a very in-depth or lengthy conversation. i would have mentioned about how my brother - i was holding these assets in my brother’s name in country g” (b) the husband cannot completely recall the conversation that he had with the wife.

(e) the husband misrepresented to the wife his intentions as to why a financial agreement was required and i make this finding based on the following: (i) the evidence supports that the husband required the financial agreement not for the purpose of dealing with the property upon the breakdown of the marriage but to protect the assets that the husband held on behalf of the brother namely company k and the bonds. (ii) this was the position also adopted by the husband’s family who were part of the driving force to ensure that a financial agreement was entered into prior to the marriage.
