reasons for judgment
judge coates:
written pleadings are frequently sent to counsel for revising containing serious allegations of fraud, dishonesty, or misconduct. the consequence of lodging such pleadings in court may be to cause irreparable injury to the person thus publicly accused. for an advocate to allow such charges to be launched with his name attached to them without the fullest investigation would be to abuse the absolute protection against actions for slander which the law affords counsel. counsel is not worthy of that protection unless he justifies it by the most scrupulous care in his written or oral attacks on character. he must insist upon being supplied with all the information which is thought by his client to justify the attack, and then he must decide for himself whether the charges made are such as con be justifiably made. in exercising his judgment in such a matter the advocate is fulfilling one of the most delicate duties to society which his profession casts upon him. it is no small responsibility which the state throws upon the lawyer in thus confiding to his discretion the reputation of the citizen. no enthusiasm for his client’s case, no specious assurance from his client that the insertion of some strong allegations will coerce favourable settlement, no desire to fortify the relevance of his client’s case, entitles the advocate to trespass, in matters involving reputation, a hair’s-breadth beyond what the facts as laid before him and duly vouched and tested will justify. it will not do say lightly that it is for the court to decide the matter. it is for counsel to see that no man’s good name is wantonly attacked.
