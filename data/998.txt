reasons for judgment
judge dickson:
introduction
background
that you have now read that affidavit, and have expressed a view as to its relevance and the impact of its contents on our client’s appropriateness to play a parenting role in the children’s lives, regretfully means that our client has no confidence in your ability to now ignore the contents of that affidavit in the conduct of this matter moving forward. as you are aware, in your role you must remain impartial in order to properly discharge your obligation as the independent children’s lawyer. we have therefore been instructed to request that you voluntarily recuse yourself and cease acting as independent children’s lawyer in this matter. the decision of our client to instruct us to make this request has not been made lightly. our client must, however, have confidence in the independent children’s lawyer’s role given the importance of the matters at stake in these proceedings.

legal principles
a number of authorities have considered the removal of an independent children's lawyer, and specifically, the circumstances which may justify such a course. from those, the following points may be discerned: it is not inconsistent with the independent and professional discharge of an independent children's lawyer’s obligations for her or him to advocate that a particular course of action adverse to, or inconsistent with, the position of a party, ought be taken by the court,[6] whilst in a unique position, the independent children's lawyer owes the same professional obligations to the court as does any licenced legal practitioner,[7] on occasion, the independent children's lawyer will be in an invidious position, but nonetheless they should be no less courageous, no less firm and no less cogent, in advocating for results or findings,[8] inevitably the role of the independent children's lawyer involves an exercise of professional judgment which may, on occasion, be precarious and difficult,[9] it is not appropriate for a litigant to endeavour to micro-manage the independent children's lawyer, or critique every step that they take,[10] it is certainly not the case that, even if an independent children's lawyer does make a mistake, the court will necessarily accede to an application to have them discharged. significantly more than that is required,[11] it is inevitable that the high standards of competence which the court expects of independent children's lawyers are not always met. independent children's lawyers are, like anybody, liable to human frailty,[12] a court should be slow to discharge an independent children's lawyer on the basis of largely unsubstantiated complaints of one of the parties.[13]
alleged bias
like so many matters in this court, it will, in my opinion, be a matter of considering the evidence presented on each application for the discharge of an independent children’s lawyer to determine if the evidence demonstrates sufficient lack of objectivity and professionalism on the part of the independent children’s lawyer such as to justify his or her discharge. the mere appearance of partiality to a particular party’s position will not necessarily suffice as to warrant the independent children’s lawyer’s removal. parents who are involved in litigation in this court about their children need to understand that as part of his or her role, the independent children’s lawyer may legitimately and responsibly say things that are challenging and confronting to the parent in respect of his or her views about parenting and the best interests of his or her children in the particular circumstances of the case, but that does not necessarily mean that the independent children’s lawyer is not acting in accordance with his or her duties in the case.[20]
the test that i shall apply is that the father needs to establish that the independent children's lawyer actually lacks impartiality or alternatively, a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children's lawyer lacks impartiality. that test of perceived lack of impartiality however, is to be judged having regard to the role and duties imposed upon the independent children's lawyer by s 68la of the act. that “rubric” is discussed by murphy j at [41] – [61] of knibbs where his honour sets out, amongst other things, the duty of the independent children's lawyer to argue firmly and fearlessly for what the independent children's lawyer contends are findings or results consistent with the best interests of particular children and describes the precarious position an independent children's lawyer is in when fulfilling that role because it may be that the independent children's lawyer is required to challenge the position of one or other of the parents.[22]
...in relation to an independent children’s lawyer the appearance of bias may be tested by whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children’s lawyer might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the task of independently representing a child.[24]
the husband could not rely on any actual perception of bias by himself as distinct from the perception of some hypothetical person. while a child’s representative should be removed if there a proper reasons for doing so, it would be quite wrong for court to remove a child’s representative merely because a litigant has taken a view that the child’s representative is acting contrary to that litigant’s position (or from the litigant’s point of view) contrary to the child’s best interests.[26]
it was a critical question whether a person in the husband’s position might reasonably believe that the child’s representative would not be impartial, but would be prejudiced against the husband by reason of his association with the former judge.[27]
the critical question in considering an application to remove a child’s representative is whether the representative is likely to carry out his or her task properly. it is not necessary to attempt to state generally the circumstances that might cause the court to find that child representative is unlikely to do so.[28]
...it has been established by a serious of decisions of this court that the test to be applied in australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias (which, in the present case, was said to take the form of pre-judgement) is whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.[31]
