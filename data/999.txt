consistency and evidence about the market since may 2022[16]
sales activity during 2023 had demonstrated a softening of the market with more days on market and less sales achieving an excess of asking prices. recent interest rate rises and a negative outlook regarding future rises, combined with inflationary pressure may act to increase this softening. it is prudent to note the economy is currently effected [sic] by the increased inflationary pressure, recent and perceived future interest rate rises, global uncertainty regarding the conflict in ukraine and the pandemic. the outlook is generally considered to be one of uncertainty which may affect market sentiment and economic conditions in a negative manner.
