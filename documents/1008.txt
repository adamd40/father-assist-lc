the hearing
consideration of what orders are in the best interests of the children in this matter
primary considerationssection 60cc(2)(a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents  that he is completely abstinent from alcohol and other drugs, by undertaking regular hft, (b) that he is adequately addressing his mental health issues, including obtaining an independent psychiatric evaluation and complying with prescribed treatments[21], (c) that his home is safe, including other people who may reside with him, (d) that he has committed no further family and domestic violence offences and has no further family violence episodes, and (e) that he has no further criminal charges or convictions.   that he is adequately addressing his mental health issues, including obtaining an independent psychiatric evaluation and complying with prescribed treatments[21], (c) that his home is safe, including other people who may reside with him, (d) that he has committed no further family and domestic violence offences and has no further family violence episodes, and (e) that he has no further criminal charges or convictions.   that his home is safe, including other people who may reside with him, (d) that he has committed no further family and domestic violence offences and has no further family violence episodes, and (e) that he has no further criminal charges or convictions.   that he has committed no further family and domestic violence offences and has no further family violence episodes, and (e) that he has no further criminal charges or convictions.   that he has no further criminal charges or convictions.
section 60cc(2)(b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse neglect or family violence
“remains in fear of the father... feeling scared and anxious around him due to his unpredictable moods and aggressive demeanour towards her and others.”[24]
the mother says that her fear of the father impacts on her capacity to interact with him. the father acknowledged that there would have been times when the mother was fearful of him
“however stated that she would not be scared of him as he is part of the community and a nice person... that as he has not seen the mother...she would no longer be fearful of him.”[25]
“denies any suicidal ideation but is clearly minimising his symptoms of depression and was not forthcoming with his previous dsp[43] in [2012]”.
“...could be considered a typical patient with alcohol and drug problems where those problems have caused multiple presentations of severe psychopathology... [mr hanjan] endorsed [several mental health conditions], depression [and] anxiety. research suggests the longer addicted patients stay sober then the more the presenting psychopathology are likely to reduce in the normal and non-clinically range.”
mr w notes that “the sober individual is more amenable to mental health treatment after a long period of abstinence starting from around six weeks sober and onwards”.
relevant additional considerations
“...throughout the assessment the father did not present as having the capacity to reflect on the children’s experience and/or to assume responsibility for the violence and a commitment to repairing the damage and addressing his behaviour through a behaviour change program.”[65]
