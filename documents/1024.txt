reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing.
background
i admit i had used illicit drugs in the past, as had the mother. however, i have been clean since the beginning of the year whereas the mother’s drug usage has increased.[5]
it was the effect of his evidence that the orders made on 24 june 2021 had been problematic from the date of their instigation.
i have real and significant concerns that both girls are in danger whilst living with the mother. the mother doesn’t care about them. [x] does as she pleases and has no boundaries. she is cutting herself and self-harming, which is increasing. she is a vulnerable person and has no direction. i am concerned that [y] is also in danger as the mother doesn’t seem to care about her. [y] has already started swearing and using expletives that are totally inappropriate for her age.[6]
the last child protection notification that the department received was on 23 february 2023, pertaining to allegations that the step-father [mr b] bailing [x] up in her bedroom and threatening to 'sort her out' if she spoke to her mother like that again after they had a verbal argument. further allegations raised: that the children had dirty clothing/nappies, that [x] was missing school, that [x] was out walking late at night, that [x] had fresh cuts down her arms and the cuts on her arms are deep enough to draw blood, that [x] stated that she was cutting herself "because they're (the mother and [mr b]) filling my head with weird thoughts and fucking with my head", that [y] had not had a bath or shower in the last 3 weeks, that [x] was sleeping on the floor in the hallway and has nowhere to store her clothes at the mother’s residence, that [y] sleeps on a mattress on the floor in her aunties room when in the mother’s care, that the father commenced a sexual relationship with the mother when she was 14 years old, that [y] previously had a sore vagina and a rash when she was 3 years old, however a doctor assessed that she was ‘okay medically’, and that the mother tried to run over [x].[7]   was spoken to separately and the version of events was corroborated by her. [x] stated that she wanted to go back to her mother’s house and wanted her phone back as she was sick of her father. nil abuse and both children were sighted and in good health.[8]
in relation to the welfare of [y] police re attended [ms hazelwood’s] address and checked on the welfare of [y] and there will nil concerns regarding living conditions, health or safety of any child residing at that address. police recorded that there were 4 suitable adults who live at the address that provided adequate care for all children living there.[9]
mum can you let dad know when you drop my stuff off at the police station my hair straightener school clothes and clothes and the money you promised love [x].[10]
the child impact report
if the court accepts that [x] and [y] are at risk of abuse and/or neglect in [ms hazelwood]’s care it may support their safety for them to live with [mr everett] until [ms hazelwood] is able to demonstrate that she has addressed these concerns.[11]
in the context of this recommendation, due to what she characterised as the significant risks identified in the case, ms s recommended that a full family report be prepared.
in light of the risks identified in relation to [x], [mr everett]’s concerns about her are likely to indicate protectiveness, however the information presented to the court in the sapol records indicates that [mr everett] has not always been child focussed in the way he has managed these concerns. if the court accepts that [mr everett] pressured [x] into making disclosures against her mother to sapol, this is likely to have had a significant emotional impact on her, particularly as speaking to police may have triggered trauma for her after having to make statements to them in relation to her sexual assault by a neighbour.[12]
clearly, if x is either being manipulated or compelled, by her father, to make unfounded claims of abuse against her mother, this would represent a significant emotional abuse of the child, as it would represent an attempt to undermine a central relationship for x, namely her maternal one.
if the court accepts that [x] has experienced abuse by [ms hazelwood] this is a significant concern and is likely to have impacted negatively on [x]’s emotional and mental health. [x] herself reported that witnessing family violence by [mr b] and fighting amongst her maternal family made her feel “suicidal”. [x] has also experienced sexual abuse by an adult neighbour which is likely to increase her vulnerability to mental health and behavioural difficulties. [x] is a young person at significant risk of harm, not only by potential abuse and neglect, but also due to her frequent running away, her disengagement from school and her feeling that she has limited support from her family at home.[13]
the icl’s position
the legal principles applicable
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.
discussion
apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.
