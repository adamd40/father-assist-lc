costs applications  i note that although the parties had agreed to attend mediation on 8 march 2022 that no order was made to that effect. it is open to the parties to seek that the court in the exercise of its general powers of case management[15] order parties to attend dispute resolution events including mediation. no such order was obtained here and i am not otherwise persuaded that the mediation attendance is part of the proceedings but rather an agreed undertaking of the parties that was sought to be conducted alongside of or as an adjunct to but not part of the proceedings, (b) agreement appears to have been made on or about 21 february 2022 to attend mediation on 8 march 2022, (c) the applicant’s mediation document was sent to the respondent’s solicitor at about 4.19pm on

respondent referred to in his evidence as being about 20%, (d) the respondent wanted to mediate the question of an extension of time in respect of which he considered schedules of assets to be of little or no consequence. there was no evidence of a clear agenda of matters set to be discussed at the mediation, (e) the respondent was communicating with his solicitor as late as 7.48pm on the evening prior to the mediation, (f) the respondent refused to mediate that day but not generally and did so after taking advice and speaking to the mediator who was experiencing what the respondent termed “technical difficulties” and offering not to charge the parties fees for the mediator’s efforts on that day, (g) the respondent had legal representation at the commencement of the mediation and participated in discussions with the mediator but was not prepared to proceed with the mediation that day, (h) the respondent by his response sealed 15 february 2022 had sought an order for mediation among the interlocutory orders brought by him. this was consistent with his position expressed to and noted in the order of the court of 24 january 2022, (i) generally in relation to the respondent’s
