property of trusts alleged to be valuable
documents relied upon
the wife’s case
8. further or alternatively, the wife contends that the instruments: (a) executed on 2 february 2021, that effected the retirement of the husband as appointer and consent to being excluded as beneficiary of the trusts, and (b) on 25 august 2021, that effected the resignation of the husband as co-director and transfer to the brother his shares in the corporate trustees,   executed on 2 february 2021, that effected the retirement of the husband as appointer and consent to being excluded as beneficiary of the trusts, and (b) on 25 august 2021, that effected the resignation of the husband as co-director and transfer to the brother his shares in the corporate trustees,   on 25 august 2021, that effected the resignation of the husband as co-director and transfer to the brother his shares in the corporate trustees,  llectively, “the dispositions”[16]) are a sham and/or entered into to defeat an anticipated order in this proceeding ...
... further or alternatively, the wife further contends the brother holds his legal interest in the property at [the [town l] property] beneficially for the husband, pursuant to a constructive or resulting trust ... ... the trust deed of the [b filipovic] investment trust was dated 2007 and, until the dispositions, had the effect that: (a) the husband [and] the brother were joint appointers and have to act jointly, (b) the husband and the brother were co-directors and equal shareholders of [the trustee],   the husband [and] the brother were joint appointers and have to act jointly, (b) the husband and the brother were co-directors and equal shareholders of [the trustee],   the husband and the brother were co-directors and equal shareholders of [the trustee],
... (d) the husband [and] the brother, together with each of their parents were named as corpus beneficiaries, (e) the husband and the brother, and their spouses, and former spouses, were included as related beneficiaries in the discretionary class of beneficiaries, ... (g) the capital and income of the trust was to vest in equal shares in the corpus beneficiaries. the [b filipovic] investment trust currently owns [valuable real property]...   the husband [and] the brother, together with each of their parents were named as corpus beneficiaries, (e) the husband and the brother, and their spouses, and former spouses, were included as related beneficiaries in the discretionary class of beneficiaries,   the husband and the brother, and their spouses, and former spouses, were included as related beneficiaries in the discretionary class of beneficiaries,   the capital and income of the trust was to vest in equal shares in the corpus beneficiaries.
... the trust deed of the [c pty ltd] trust ...until the dispositions, had the effect that: (a) the husband [and] the brother were joint appointers and have to act jointly, (b) the husband and the brother were co-directors and equal shareholders of [the trustee],
... (d) the husband [and] the brother ... were named as corpus beneficiaries, (e) the husband and the brother, and their spouses, and former spouses, were included as related beneficiaries in the discretionary class of beneficiaries, ... (g) the capital and income of the trust was to vest in equal shares in the corpus beneficiaries. the [c pty ltd] trust currently owns, at least, half of the shares in [other companies that own or have owned valuable real property]...   the husband [and] the brother ... were named as corpus beneficiaries, (e) the husband and the brother, and their spouses, and former spouses, were included as related beneficiaries in the discretionary class of beneficiaries,
... since about 2006, the wife contends the husband and the brother have agreed to conduct businesses and make investments by way of a partnership ... pursuant to which they have operate and own (as the case may be):   the [business] trading as “[y pty ltd]”, (b) the partnership known as “[the filipovic partnership]”, (c) the company known as “[y pty ltd]”, (d) the company known as “[y pty ltd]”, and (e) the trusts, namely the “[b filipovic] investment trust” and [c pty ltd] trust”, (the “[c pty ltd] partnership”). the wife contends the husband and the brother, through [their] partnership and otherwise, have operated their entities jointly, in partnership, with equality, for their mutual benefit and, in the absence of disclosure to the contrary, that this extends to the assets of the trusts.   the trusts, namely the “[b filipovic] investment trust” and [c pty ltd] trust”,
particulars  -(i) [various transfers of money between 31 may 2021 and 27 feb 2022 alleged to be to the husband’s benefit and demonstrate a partnership] (j) [d pty ltd] remains the landlord of [b filipovic], the business conducted by the husband and the brother. (k) in or around 2017 the husband and the brother invested [b filipovic’s] profits in [another company] formed to develop an application for tablets and mobile devices, of whom the husband and brother were, and remain, joint shareholders. further, the wife refers to the evidence of the husband himself at paragraphs 6, 8-10, 15 and 17.   [d pty ltd] remains the landlord of [b filipovic], the business conducted by the husband and the brother. (k) in or around 2017 the husband and the brother invested [b filipovic’s] profits in [another company] formed to develop an application for tablets and mobile devices, of whom the husband and brother were, and remain, joint shareholders.   in or around 2017 the husband and the brother invested [b filipovic’s] profits in [another company] formed to develop an application for tablets and mobile devices, of whom the husband and brother were, and remain, joint shareholders.
... in all of these circumstances, the wife contends that the husband and the brother each have in reality, a fixed half interest in the assets of the trusts, the [town l] property and other assets of the [filipovic] partnership.[17] alternatively,[18] the wife contends the husband’s right to due administration and due consideration is property. further, the assets of the trusts, the [town l] property and the other assets of the [husband and the brother’s] partnership are capable of being valued in circumstances where the husband and the brother have benefited equally from them. ... further or alternatively, to the extent that the [town l] property does not form part of the [filipovic] partnership, the wife contends that the husband has a beneficial interest in the [town l] property. despite its registration in the name of the brother, the [town l] property was purchased equally by the husband and the brother in 2009, such registration being effected as to qualify for the first home owners’ grant and avoid land tax and other costs. ... in these circumstances, the wife contends the husband has an interest in the [town l] property pursuant to a constructive or resulting trust. ... the participation of the [pjps] is necessary to remedy the husband’s attempt to defeat the wife’s entitlement to a just and equitable property settlement and properly determine and quantify his legal and equitable interest in the assets of the trusts, pursuant to the [filipovic] partnership, or otherwise, the [town l] property and other assets of the [filipovic] partnership. [emphasis added]
mr dinelli: ...so coming to the partnership as we describe it at paragraph 20 and following, we say that, since about 2006, ... the husband and the brother have agreed to conduct businesses and make investments by way of a partnership pursuant to which they have operated and owned various entities, partnerships and indeed trustee companies pursuant to – we describe or define it as the [c pty ltd] partnership. it might be described as an overarching partnership. it’s overarching, your honour, because the actual particular corporate or trust structures that they use underneath that partnership are all operated pursuant to the terms of the partnership.
... the appellant says that his honour was in error in finding that the alleged inferred agreement was inconsistent with the corporate and trust structure and that in dismissing the appellant's claim his honour failed to have regard to substantial evidence which supported the existence of that agreement. ... the respondent denied there was any such partnership or relationship, and said that their past dealings did not reflect any agreement of the nature alleged by the appellant. accordingly, their respective rights and entitlements in relation to the companies in the palermo group and the exercise of their rights as shareholders were not confined by any obligations of the nature alleged. ... it was conceded by senior counsel for the respondent that the primary judge would have been in error if he had found that an overall contractual agreement of the nature alleged by the appellant could not, as a matter of law, exist consistently with the corporate and trust structure the parties had established from 1976. that concession was properly made. ... ... in friend v brooker[20], friend and brooker ...incorporated a company, of which they were appointed directors and of which their respective family trusts were equal shareholders....the company went into liquidation and was unable to repay money which brooker had borrowed and lent to the company. brooker alleged a partnership or joint venture existed between himself and friend... the high court...concluded that no right of contribution arose. the plurality noted the unchallenged finding of fact of the trial judge that from the time of incorporation of the company the partnership ceased, 'just as the parties intended'... that case is a long way removed from the present case. it is not authority for the proposition that an inferred agreement of the nature alleged by the appellant could not, as a matter of law, exist consistently with the corporate and trust structure the parties had established. ... it was, in my opinion, clearly open to the parties to agree, as the appellant alleged it was to be inferred that they had agreed, that, as between themselves, the shareholdings in the companies, the beneficial interests in the trusts, and the rights to capital and income (or the burden of losses) of the various entities, under their individual or collective control, were to be dealt with so that the total wealth generated by all of the businesses, to which either or both of them would otherwise be entitled, would be shared equally by the appellant and the respondent, what has conveniently been described by the appellant as an 'overarching agreement'.

the wife’s alternate case: “due administration’ & “due consideration” argument
mr glick: the proposition which is embedded in ...kennon v spry, as to why the court was able to adjust the rights of the parties and say the assets were the husband’s assets was because, as said by gummow, hayne jj and his honour the chief justice, french cj, the trustee was able to determine who got it, who got the income and who got the 40 capital. in this case that – and that’s what harris v dewell picks up – am i as the appointor, a single appointor, able to determine who gets what? and the answer is yes, because if this trustee doesn’t listen to me i will appoint myself. ... as the law presently stands which... is binding on this court, the court of appeal has said given kennon v spry... does the husband have the ability to determine that there will or will not be a distribution and to whom? in spry, yes...but in this case, no.
the proposed to be joined parties’ (‘the pjps’) case
pjp’s response to alternative “due administration’ & “due consideration” argument
... as these reasons explain, in my view the husband’s interests under the relevant trusts are capable of valuation and they constitute property, as defined in s 4(1) of the act, for the purpose of a proceeding for the alteration of property interests under s 79 of the act.
mr glick: ... but it’s the right to be [considered]– it’s not the asset which is being measured. it’s not the trust assets. it’s the chose in action, being the right to be considered... [so is] that paragraph in the [wife’s] submissions...
the wife contends the husband’s right to due administration and due consideration is property?
answer: yes, it is, according to french, gummow and hayne jj in spry, they said that. but they said it’s a species of property within the definition of matrimonial property. but ... i don’t mean this pejoratively – so what? can it be measured? can it be valued? you’re not valuing the underlying asset. you’re not valuing the estate...you’re saying what’s the value of your right to be considered, how much value do you place upon it? so that paragraph doesn’t go anywhere so far as the third party is concerned... [and] does that [valuation] require the third party to be joined? [the answer is] no, your honour...and they can do that [valuation] anyway.
the husband’s case
16. the definition of property set out at s.4 of the act provides:
property means: (a) in relation to the parties to a marriage or either of them—means property to which those parties are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or reversion, (emphasis added) ... the wife has not demonstrated, and cannot demonstrate, that the husband is entitled to the property of the trusts. importantly, the wife does not assert the trusts were operated for the husband’s sole benefit, nor does she advance any material fact which demonstrates that the trusts were used by the husband for his sole benefit. the wife’s argument is entirely supposition without any factual basis. it is apparent that she is hoping to conduct a fishing expedition by joining the trusts and [the brother].   in relation to the parties to a marriage or either of them—means property to which those parties are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or reversion, (emphasis added)
the undertaking to be bound as to section 106b application
mr glick: and the question becomes whether or not...the parties for whom i appear are necessary parties. now, can i immediately make this concession... i accept the following: on the face of it the transfer of shares between the husband and the second proposal respondent, if it is to be set aside under section 106b plainly involves my client... the way that one can avoid the necessity of becoming a party for that is to give an undertaking to be bound by the result and we would give that undertaking, your honour. we will plainly be a witness on the 106b point and we will give an undertaking to be bound by any result without the necessity of joining us... so that my learned friend, of course, can run his 106b case. on the face of it i can understand that case, that the transactions occurred at around the time shortly before the separation and on the face of it does invite a 106b application. well, we can be bound by the result and your honour doesn’t have to join us for that purpose.... his honour: that’s to the 106b aspect, but not as to the - - - mr glick: not as to the others.
the later written submissions: mir v mir and genesalio
... the point made in the previous paragraph is illustrated by considering the relief claimed by john. john seeks the appointment of a receiver to the partnership for the purpose of winding up the partnership. but if that order is made, what could the receiver do in relation to the various trusts that hold mir group property? even assuming that the receiver could take control of the property held on trust, he could only do so in accordance with the terms of the relevant trust deeds. then what could the receiver do? john does not and cannot provide an answer to this question. in my opinion, this is a fatal problem with john’s claim that there was an overarching partnership. the parties, on accounting advice, chose a particular structure through which to conduct their business. that structure is inconsistent with the partnership john asserts exists. the fact that george, john and tony described their relationship as a partnership and may have believed that they were partners cannot alter the position.
... as i have said, on the evidence before the court, there is much to be said for the proposition that george, john and tony, by their conduct and by instructions given to advisors, impliedly agreed that they would exercise their powers as trustees, directors or partners of mir group entities or would procure that members of their families who acted as trustees, directors or partners of mir group entities would exercise their powers to ensure that the profits of the group would be distributed equally between the three families. if there was such an agreement, questions arise concerning its status following george’s death and whether it had other terms and other parties (such as family members). however, no party advanced an argument in support of such an agreement. the only agreement advanced by the plaintiffs was a partnership agreement, which had the equal sharing of profits as one of its terms ... ... to some extent, however, the situation has arisen because of the way in which the parties have chosen to present their respective cases ...
conclusion as to joinder
overarching partnership is arguable tations included as footnotes below]
the alternative point: due administration and consideration is property is arguable
should the pjps undertaking avoid joinder?
disclosure orders sought
restraint injunction
there is sufficient ‘danger’ or risk of dissipation or dealings with assets and entities which would frustrate potential orders in the wife’s favour, that the balance of convenience demonstrates that the injunctions as sought by the wife should be made pending final hearing.
