the law
the primary considerations  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  ] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) – something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act – the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent.
meaningful relationship
...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...[3]
protection from harm
family violence
“coercive control” is a term coined in 2007 by forensic social worker evan stark meaning: “a malevolent course of conduct that subordinates women to an alien will by violating their physical integrity (violence), denying them respect and autonomy (intimidation), depriving them of social connectedness, (isolation), and appropriating or denying them access to the resource required for... personhood and citizenship (control).[7]
the assessment of whether conduct that falls within one of the provided examples constitutes family violence as defined in s 4ab(1) of the act necessarily requires that conduct to be considered in the context in which it occurred.
...as a result of long-term coercion the controlled partner becomes severely demoralised and confined in an “invisible cage” in their own minds. because no options for self-protection, resistance or escape are perceived, the victim becomes docile in her own oppression. this docility undermines her credibility as an informant when she eventually reports the abuse because anyone with normal self-efficacy is likely to wonder: “if the danger was as high as you say why did you stay/ go back/ not report the abuse previously?” the mental architecture of the “invisible cage” includes warped cognition which i call the triumph of hope over experience. from the point of view of family, friends and helpers, some abused women do not know when it is time to give up. because their risk assessments are based on hopes for the future rather than memories of the past, they predict relationship outcomes based on the desirability rather than their probability.... furthermore, this “invisible cage” can be re-invoked in subsequent court proceedings (even years after escaping an abusive situation) to the advantage of the abuser, as a result of the victim’s trauma induced responses to the perpetrators re-entry into her life including: anxiety, depression, ptsd, suicidal despair, confused thinking, incoherence and public emotional outbursts.[8]
i agree that during the relationship i subjected [ms moloney] to acts of domestic violence in the form of destroying property, name calling, put downs and threats. i agree that at times, especially towards the end of our relationship, this occurred on a daily basis.[9]
i took my anger out [on] the furniture or the wall whilst [ms moloney] was in the room.[10]

conclusion
no. the toxic mix view is not helpful. the toxic mix view is not helpful, because some – some couples are a toxic mix and they blow apart, but that’s no excuse for coercive control. coercive control is a behaviour based on a grandiose sense of entitlement. having said that, not everyone is as easily victimised. people with trauma histories are easier to victimise than others. a subsequent partner might be a lot harder to victimise for someone who is – whose – whose tendency is overentitlement. they might find a subsequent partner not as easy to victimise as someone who has already been predisposed to victimisation by their trauma history.
mental health
...experienced a disturbing traumatic event in the past which produces recurrent episodes of anxiety... because of the premium she places upon harmony, she is likely to be uncomfortable with interpersonal confrontation or conflict, shun controversy, and be quick to forgive others and give them a second chance.[33]
...neither is incapacitated by mental illness. both are socially functional even if limited by intrinsic personal characteristics. the mother is deemed to be a normative parent but exacerbating her anxiety might reduce her emotional availability to [the child]. the father’s high trait narcissism implies empathy deficits.[34]
...vulnerable and most likely suffered significant trauma in relation to the incident with the [assault] as a teenager. this victimisation had perhaps predisposed her to the vulnerability with a domestic violent relationship.[35]
drug use
alcohol misuse
the additional considerations
any views expressed by the child
the nature of the child’s relationship with the parents and other significant persons
it appeared to me that her [x’s] identity, insofar as it links to, ‘i’m a member of this family,’ her biological father has no place in her mental landscape at all... now, as far as i can ascertain, [x] has no interest or no awareness of her father at this stage. the right time for her to have any contact for her father would be when she wants to.
in this brief observation [x] behaves like a normal, happy securely attached child who values all her family ties and expects adults to be reliable, kind and helpful. she either exhibited or reported affectionate relationships with household members and close relatives, including her grandparents.[41]
the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and their demonstrated attitude to the child and the responsibilities of parenthood
when i ask a question about a child, and about a child’s likely thoughts, feelings or motivations, i expect an answer in which the child is the subject of the verb.... someone who just answers in terms of themselves is not thinking about the child’s mind. they’re thinking about the child as the child benefits them, stands in relation to them, is a lifestyle accessory, or however might they think about the child, but they’re not trying to hold the child’s mind in their own mind. and it’s not rocket science. even people with the most limited levels of english language fluency can say something that tells the difference between whether they’re answering from their perspective or whether they are trying to imagine the child’s perspective. now, he said he doesn’t – he didn’t understand what she knew. you know, he hadn’t seen her for a long time. that was fair enough. but what i wanted him to do was speculate about what would a child like this feel? how would it be - and that’s what he didn’t do.
although [the mother] is a competent parent, i believe that domestic violence and coercion has potentially had a negative impact on [the mother’s] ability to parent. [the mother] is showing her vulnerability in that even though there was a separation due to alleged violence [the mother] decided to allow [the father] back into her life, and... continued to stay in the relationship.[46]
the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with the child
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent's obligations to maintain the child
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances
...no doubt [x] would be baffled by any sudden requirement to spend time with [the father].[47]
whether it would be preferable to make an order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
...my client’s intended proposal happens in an order that allows it to be more child led, and that would be that my client undertakes a period of dialectical behaviour therapy or mbt. after a period of compliance, say 18 months, that counsellor can then indicate to the mother, keeping the parties’ information separate, that the father has complied with that period of treatment. and, thereafter, the yearly check-ins that arose from [dr r’s] evidence, to, in an appropriate way, by an appropriate professional, explore whether or not [x] has engaged with – or whether she is interested in, as [dr r] put it, knowing her biological paternal line. and that is not a therapy, rather an appropriate way, as [dr r] did, of exploring [x’s] worldview and whether she is questioning, “well, where does my [dornan] half come from?” and that would be more child led....
it is difficult. i suppose where your honour could pull up is that if my client, in fact, undertakes dialectical behavioural therapy, and there is this mechanism of just exploring with [x] how she is going, perhaps that information, in terms of her curiosity about her paternal line, can be fed back to the father. that then could, potentially, give rise to a rice v asplund...
assessment of risk
is there an unacceptable risk of harm?
...suffer insecurity, fear, unhappiness, anxiety and hypervigilance from witnessing abusive behaviour of a parent. such effects present a threat to their emotional development. probably the worst danger to children is the role model that a violent parent provides which can lead to children themselves coming to suffer the serious social disability of using violence in their dealings with other people including those they love. such a disability can destroy the most intimate relationships and bring the person into conflict with other people, the police and the law...
i don’t know of any evidence that coercively controlling parents offer something positive to children. however, there is a lot of evidence that they are harmful psychologically to children, and i’m looking at it from the point of view as, what would [x] miss from the life she has now if she didn’t have contact with her father at this time? given the risks of such contact, if it is found that he is coercively controlling. ..... there is really nothing constructive he can offer to a child, and it’s best to exclude him.
allegations of “choking” always require very careful scrutiny by the court as it has been identified as a marker of serious dv... research indicating that prior non-fatal strangulation attempts are strongly associated with women’s subsequent deaths at the hands of their partners/ ex-partners increasing the risk of attempted lethal harm sixfold and the risk of completed homicide sevenfold inspired pushes in some states for legislative changes making nfs a stand-alone offence with higher penalties than other forms of dv/assault...in the same vein, the literature relating to children’s deaths in the context of dv indicates that when a woman is at risk of fatal harm by a partner or ex-partner then her children participate fully in that risk, and indeed may serve as proxy victims for their mother.[49]
in a nutshell, i assess there to be a low risk of harm to [x] in the sole care of her mother, rising to moderate risk if supervised father–child contact is allowed. spending unsupervised time with her father is assessed to entail high risk to [x].[50] (emphasis as per original)
is there a risk of being expose to harm? yes. if his potential for violence and coercive control are [as] alleged then i would say it’s very likely that... emotional abuse and neglect are almost certain...and physical neglect and abuse are also possible. they are possible because empathy defects underlie lots of abuse and neglect.
as a group, people with strong narcissistic traits have deficiencies in empathy, which mean that they can’t ever prioritise their children’s needs over their own, including emotional needs. therefore, if they are, for example, upset with the mother or angry about someone else, they don’t shield the child from their emotions and their hostility the way someone who was more normally adjusted would do. that’s one thing. that’s to do with narcissistic personalities. and the second is that, as a group, men who are coercively controlling and/or physically abusing to their spouses often show very destructive – psychologically destructive – parenting practices, even if they never harm the child.
...on this point it would be important to probe thoroughly at final hearing whether [the father] has acknowledged and taken full responsibility for his prior aggression and coercion - including the threatening, intimidating behaviour for which he was charged and found guilty – since nothing emerged from this assessment to convince me of his sincere remorse. personality testing indicates that he overestimates his virtues, denies his shortcomings and resists corrective feedback... it remains for the court to determine whether the evidence overall better supports [the father’s] characterisation of their prior relationship as volatile, or better supports [the mother’s] allegations about his coercive control.[52]
i would take that passage to mean several things. first of all, i believe that he has received excellent legal advice. secondly, i would take it to mean that he may have developed some insights into counselling, to the extent that he is willing to admit his prior faults where there’s no way he could avoid it on the evidence. whether that’s based on sincere remorse or whether that’s a matter of rational self-interest, i cannot judge, just on that paragraph.
...i was arrested and blindside by a heap of allegations and charges... i was made to jump through hoops at court, as i had to defend the unsubstantiated allegations. i was convicted as i pleaded guilty for the charge [...] i was put on a good behaviour bond [...]. despite the assault charge being fabricated by [the mother]. consequently, i had to complete anger management courses, domestic violence courses and regular appointments with a psychologist. a lot of these professionals empathised with me and agree that i should not be in that situation.[53]
i understand my actions years ago are not acceptable and i believe [the mother’s] was not either i just never pursued legal charges we were both as bad as each other and i have evidence of it in the form of videos.
can the unacceptable risk of harm be sufficiently ameliorated?
...he can make no constructive contribution to [the child’s] life at her current vulnerable young age – if ever. coercively controlling men are highly narcissistic and highly narcissistic parents cannot consistently prioritise the needs of their children. neither psycho education nor psychotherapy would be effective to address parenting deficits associated with pathological narcissism on any timescale commensurate with the progression of time [the father] proposes. while some brands of specialised psychotherapy (such as mbt or dbt) claim to improve pd within two years of treatment, an essential ingredient for therapeutic success is the clients insight into the need to change - which [the father] lacks according to his self- reports.
as a group, spousal abusers are not characterised by any one particular psychiatric diagnosis, and many of them would attract no diagnosis. but the overarching attitude is entitlement, and the overarching behaviour is coercion, coercive control of others, whether it’s violent or not violent. now, if the court finds that – that was my – what i said there, that suggests that degree of pathological narcissism, which i’ve already suggested among the reasons – and i’ve gone on to say that while there are some specialised forms of psychotherapy, it doesn’t happen quickly. it won’t happen within two years, and it really depends on to the client’s insight and the need to change. now, that’s the difference between rational self-interest and saying, “i better say the right thing, and i better start trying to do it or i’m not going to get anywhere in this”, versus saying, “i have been deeply wronged in the way i’ve thought about relationships and the way i conducted my life. it has led to bad outcomes for me. i want to change. it will be hard. it will be painful, but i will do it.” now, i can’t – i can’t assess if that’s the case for the father in this case, but even so, 12 months wouldn’t cut the mustard.
...mental health treatment is unpromising as risk mitigation. the determining consideration is the father’s potential for fv, the overarching feature of which is a sense of over entitlement relative to others which justifies tyranny. pathological narcissism tends to resist treatment.[60]
if you go through, the first thing is changing abusive behaviour. that means freely acknowledging all of it. no excuses. “yes, i did it.” and then changing it. the next thing is modelling constructive – that doesn’t apply, because he has no relationship with [x]. the next thing is... men who are sincere in their willingness to reform themselves completely renounce denial, blaming and justification – “she made me do it”, “it was only because of that”, “no, it wasn’t quite like that” – when it has been substantiated that these things happened. the next thing is they accept all the consequences. that means criminal consequences, obeying the law, and also accepting that, as a result, they have been judged. they have lost the trust of people whose cooperation they need, and it may not be possible ever to regain it. the next thing is acknowledging the damage. you know, the damage that has been done to their children, and so on. the next thing is supporting the mother’s parenting.... and the next things come on to when the relationship with the child has resumed – listening, validating. but number 8 is the key point, and that means not forcing the page or – forcing the rate or trying to turn the page. that means someone who sincerely wishes to repair the damage caused by being violent to a spouse, with all the attendant effects that has had on their relationship with the chid or children, knows that this must happen at the child’s rate. when the child is ready – developmentally ready, psychologically ready, and willing – and on the child’s terms. now, that means you can’t put a time on it. first of all, he would have had to have demonstrated a significant change with dbt. and secondly, where is the evidence that [x] has asked for anything here? that she has said, “gee, i’d really like to know my own dad,” or, “who is my own dad?” where is the evidence here? because if that had emerged, that would be evidence that there might be – it might be time to start something for [x’s] sake. but in the – in the lack of such evidence, then you can’t put a timetable like that – 12 months of this and six months of that and three months of something else. he’s going to do dbt for 12 months. bearing in mind that a lot of people say narcissistic personality disorder is incurable, but the optimists say that it can improve with five to 10 years of psychotherapy, but he proposes one year.
no, i don’t feel safe.
not really, but i – as i said, he has received excellent legal advice. i would like to say that in terms of coercively controlling men’s proposals, that’s the best one i have ever seen. whether it’s sincere or not, i cannot judge, but it’s the most realistic in terms that most people try and say, “no, not me, i didn’t do it. it’s all a lie” or “so? her fault” instead of saying, “yes, i did something. yes, i have a problem. yes, i am going to deal with it”. that’s a good proposal. but whether – do avos or section 68 or anything else ever protect anybody from somebody who really wants to do harm? that he proposes it is a good sign insofar as he – it could – he could be declaring, “see, i am now motivated by rational self-interest. i have not violated the previous avos. i really want this goal and i am even putting in there something that would shoot me in the foot if i disobeyed”. so i don’t think it should give her any confidence about what he may or may not do, but it – because as we know, if people want to do bad things, there’s really nothing that can stop them. the police don’t respond until something has already happened. but it does – it does provide some reason to think that he might be acting a rational, goal‑oriented way.
if there was supervised time and it was supervised forever, if that’s the question you’re asking me, the route – the chance of abuse and neglect are mitigated. equally, the potential for emotional abuse and neglect is reduced. not eliminated but reduced. but the point is why do it.
the mother’s caregiving ability
...in upholding children's right to protection from sexual, psychological and/or emotional harm, the court must take into account any anxiety on the part of the primary caregiver concerning the child's exposure to potential harm where such anxiety is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s caregiving ability.
importantly, the full court in marra held that not only is it necessary for the court to determine whether a parent has a genuine concern about the welfare of the child in the care of the other parent but it is also necessary to determine whether the concerned parent’s parenting capacity will be “discernibly impaired”. ‘discernibly’, or similar expressions that have been used in the relevant authorities to which we have referred, means no more than being an evident or detectable impairment in parenting capacity such that there is an unacceptable risk that the child’s welfare will be adversely impacted.
due to [ms moloney’s] emotional vulnerability, there is a significant risk that the mother’s capacity could be significantly eroded to the detriment of the child if she felt overwhelmed or threatened by the father. the mother’s vulnerability due to her previous traumatic experiences in the trauma that she experienced in the relationship with [mr dornan] could have an adverse effect on her ability to parent her child if she became overwhelmed or her trauma was re-triggered. as to whether [x] should have supervised or unsupervised time with the father, i am unable to make firm recommendations as i have not met the father or the child. however, the impact of contact on the mother could be quite significant. i believe the mother does have high vulnerability in relation to her history of trauma as a teenager and from the relationship with [mr dornan]. on balance, i believe it would be difficult for the mother to manage her anxiety levels and this is likely to impact on her ability to care for [x]. at this point, i would hold serious concerns about the mother’s well-being should either supervised or unsupervised be allowed with the applicant father is a mother is highly fearful that the father could track her of find herself and [x]. ..... if the court believed that the father presented as such a high risk and threat to the mother and – or child such that the mother’s household could not achieve sufficient peace and tranquillity for the child to develop in a healthy manner then a no contact order would be appropriate.[62]
i was getting support i didn’t need the medication.
when someone – a mother becomes extremely anxious and emotionally overwhelmed, then they’re less emotionally available to their child and makes them less good as a mother. i, however, would not use that as the only reason for not doing it if i thought there was any benefit to the child. i would say to the mother, “suck it up.” you know, “go and get some therapy and learn how to manage your responses.” however, anything that makes the mother anxious degrades her parenting capacity, and it’s not to be done unless there’s a very good reason.
the child
...to the extent that [the mother] sincerely dreads [the father] she would most likely inadvertently infect [the child] with her anxiety via non-verbal cues even if she did not openly revile him. when the primary caregiver cannot shield a child from adverse event experiences (such as tense handovers or unwelcome visits with a stranger in a strange place) a young child’s overall attachment security is eroded.[63]
i dispute the 12 month of dbt would have made any significant impact, and i think that upsetting her by introducing her to a counsellor to talk about things that are not immediately relevant to her life, as well as preparing her for something that may not happen imminently and may not happen ever, would be an unnecessary disruption to the child, and i can’t think of anything that – any argument for it that serves the child’s interests at this time in her development.
now, as far as i can ascertain, [x] has no interest or no awareness of her father at this stage. the right time for her to have any contact for her father would be when she wants to. now, that’s – i know that’s a vague answer but children vary. some children may wish to know – you know, have a – she might have a little friend at school who goes to visit her biological dad on the weekend, even though she lives happily with her mum and her stepdad the rest of the time. she might say to her mum, “well, suzy goes to see her dad. where’s my dad?” and that’s, at that stage, if a child draws negative conclusions, such as, “what’s wrong with me that my dad’s not interested in me?”, that can be harmful to identity. and that is at the time at which children need to receive some sort of explanations that they can make sense of that explain their family constellation and where they fit into it. and, after that, identity contact might be sensible and necessary. but at this point i can’t see that – well, i don’t know. well, when i saw [x] she appeared to have no awareness of her father, and no interest in the family circle wider than the one she lives in now.
the first thing i would say is, if you decided someone is going to exercise parental responsibility, and you believe that they have empathy for their – her – their – her daughter and her – her best interests at heart, then you have to trust her to make a good decision later on... if you’re not prepared to do that, and – and you want to do something else, to interfere in family life, in a level that would be unusual for people who hadn’t been divorced, then what you could do is ask for – for [x] to have a yearly check-up with an – a counsellor, nominated by the court, who was not ever directly raise the question of “do you want to see your father?”, or whatever, but kind of see where [x] was in that stage – at that stage of her development or curiosity, and who had – and who could advise the mother, “this would be a good time for you to, you know, get in contact and suggest, blah blah blah, subject to the father having completed therapy, subject to this, subject to that, subject to whatever safety conditions”. that’s the only way you could really safeguard that for [x], if you feel you’re not – if the court wasn’t prepared to just leave it to the mother’s judgment. but i don’t think raising the issue with her now is a good idea, because it’s not meaningful and it’s not coming from her expert.

changing x’s surname
it is better for the child to share a surname with the parent they live with, who is their primary caregiver, and with whose family they identify. that is much more sensible. if a child is in contact with both parents, a hyphenated name makes sense. if there’s likely to be never any contact, ever, well, just [moloney] makes sense. if a link is desired to show the biological heritage, then [moloney-dornan] would be a sensible one. but whatever, i think it is much better for the child’s identity that some part of her name at least is shared with her mother.
