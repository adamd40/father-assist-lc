background
material before the court
the law
the weight to be given to the evidence of dr c
the reports prepared by dr c  identified two main issues. the first was the ongoing difficulty of the parents consistently prioritising a lack of acrimony in their dealings with each other. the second issue was the mother’s behaviour, being her difficulty in consistently supporting x’s relationships with others (including the father), (b) identified that the mother had spoken to x about court proceedings (at [41]), (c) stated that x expressed a concern that no one was there for her mother and so x tries to be the support person for her mother (at [42]). x told dr c that this was ‘added stress i don’t need’, (d) noted that x told her that the mother speaks to x about her (the mother’s) problems (at [42]), (e) stated that x worries about her mother when she is away from her including worrying that her mother would get lonely. x worried that she might let something slip to ms d that may be used against her mother in court, that will make her mother sad, and that she therefore can’t fully relax (at [43]), (f) mentioned x referring to court orders as ‘dodgy’. x told dr c that it was her mother’s view that court orders were ‘dodgy’ (at [45]), (g) noted x’s statement that her father never talked about court matters (at [45]) and that x explained that her father does not talk negatively about her mother. x described this to dr c as ‘refreshing’ (at [48]), (h) stated that x advised that the mother speaks negatively about ms d (at [48]), (i) stated that x advised that her mother would back her (x) up if she did not wish to go on a trip interstate with the father, ms d and f (ms d’s son) in early 2023 (at [53]), (j) noted x told her that ms d had spoken negatively about the mother, (k) noted the view of x’s school counsellor, ms g that, among other things, x will adjust regardless of the caregiving arrangements so long as there is clarity and consistency, and once court matters cease (at [56]), (l) noted that x had told ms g that she (x) was under pressure from the mother to ‘tell the court psychologist’ that she was not happy at her father’s home (at [57]), (m) considered that the mother presented as somewhat fixated on the father’s flaws, and displayed impaired insight into her own potential contribution to the current situation at hand (at [77]), (n) noted that the mother had sought support from her own allied health worker and counsellor for her own mental health, however had not sought support that was child-focussed, which was what had been recommended in the first report, (o) considered that x felt ‘burdened and stressed in her role in her mother’s care, where her mother relies on her for support (and whom over-involves her in family acrimony), and this causes x to worry when away from the mother’ (at [92]). as a result, dr c held significant concerns for x’s emotional well-being, (p) stated that x had not had the opportunity to develop views and opinions with sufficient independence about her time spend arrangements (at [97]), (q) considered that ‘despite x’s wishes regarding time spent, she is settled when at the father’s home, and does not wish to leave at the conclusion of time.’ dr c noted that father and daughter shared a ‘strong and loving bond’. dr c noted that that the matters that ‘negatively affect’ x’s enjoyment at her father’s include, ‘(i) worry about court matters and saying the wrong thing where she is feeling she needs to censor herself, (ii) worry about her mother’s wellbeing and lack of support in her absence, (iii) her relationship with the father’s partner, and, (iv) the difference in rules/expectations across both homes, particularly with regard to pets. it is the assessor’s opinion that these factors are heavily influenced by the adults in x’s life, particularly her mother’ (at [98]), (r) considered that x likely experiences her mother as a friend and confidant, appears somewhat anxiously attached to her mother, and there are signs of an enmeshed relationship (at [99]), (s) noted that x experiences her father as the most able to keep her separate from family law matters (at [102]), (t) considered that x’s loyalty to her mother is having a negative impact on her relationship with ms d, however ms d also needs to refrain from sharing opinions about the mother with x (at [104]), (u) noted that in respect of the mother, ‘there are a range of concerns regarding her ability to adequately and consistently support x’s relationship with her father and partner. in addition, the mother lacks suitable boundaries. the mother’s behaviour, whilst at times subtle, is serving to undermine x’s relationships, and is having a negative impact on x’s mental-health. it is toxic’ (at [105]), (v) noted that the mother engages in behaviour ‘that serves to (i) ensure x’s continual reliance on her for simple matters, and (ii) reduce x’s confidence in her own abilities, and, (iii) reduce confidence in the father’s role and abilities’. the mother’s behaviour is self-serving and significantly lacking in child-focus (at [109]), (w) stated that while it would be ideal if orders could be made in line with x’s wishes, they cannot be, given the parents behaviour. dr c noted ‘the mother-child dynamic risks becoming increasingly problematic and relevant to time-spent arrangements as x progresses through the teenage years’ (at [115]), (x) considered that the mother ‘struggles to adequately support the father-child relationship. at this point, the best way to protect the father-child relationship is via significant and substantial time. a fifty-fifty week-about arrangement is recommended’ (at [116]).   identified that the mother had spoken to x about court proceedings (at [41]), (c) stated that x expressed a concern that no one was there for her mother and so x tries to be the support person for her mother (at [42]). x told dr c that this was ‘added stress i don’t need’, (d) noted that x told her that the mother speaks to x about her (the

mother, dr c stated that x had essentially taken on her mother’s feelings and stress and worry... she had taken on a protective role with regards to her mother (transcript p-141, lines 6-8, 10), (b) that issues she had raised in the first report had gotten worse by the time she prepared the second report to the point where x is incredibly stressed and confused, tearful, low in her mood at times and carries a heavy burden (transcript p-141, lines 22-25), (c) x will continue to carry the weight and the burden of her mother’s mental health and stress if change doesn’t occur (transcript p-141, lines 37-39), (d) that without intervention, x will become more aligned to her mother, particularly the mother’s negative view of the father, and that will have a negative impact on the father-child relationship (transcript p-142, lines 1-5), (e) the benefit [of a week-about arrangement] is that significant and substantial time with her father will protect against the issues that are present in the relationship and the dynamic with her mother (transcript p-142, lines 43-45). more time at the father’s home will provide x with an opportunity to develop independent views that she’s not really free to develop when she’s at her mother’s home (transcript p-143, lines 1-3). moreover, dr c considered x would accept week-about now, but the older she gets, the less likely that becomes, and something needs to be done to protect the father-child relationship before the opportunity is missed (transcript p-143, lines 35-36), (f) there are costs for x in implementing an equal-shared-care

right. okay. what study or research basis are you relying upon in support of your assertion that it’s best for [x] to have an equal-shared-care arrangement?---i don’t think it’s best for [x] to have an equal-shared-care arrangement. i think it’s best for [x] if the parents changed, and particularly the mother more recently, so that [x] can have what she wants. there would be absolutely no issue if the mother’s behaviour was not interrupting her time with the father - - - so - - -?--- - - - there would be no concern with carrying on with 5/9 arrangement. okay. so given that it’s news to you that my client has consulted a child psychologist about arrangements for [x], does that give you some level of comfort?---no, it wouldn’t, your honour. no, it wouldn’t?---it’s great that she has, but my question for the mother is her ability to shift in what i would say a developmentally timely fashion for [x].
but having done all of that, she comes along to you and she’s asked what she wants, all the more forcefully: “i want it to go back to the way it was, please, why isn’t anybody listening to me”?---yes, absolutely. is this going to be a horrible remembered chapter for her in - - -?---this absolutely will be. - - - assertiveness and being listened to by adults?---absolutely, absolutely. okay. using your – using your - - -?---it should never be – you misquoted me before when you said that the best thing for [x] is a week-about, no, it’s not, that’s the best in a bad situation. the best thing for [x] would be that these issues were not present, that the mother had gone and worked on these issues and developed insight, had suitable boundaries, so that it’s not affecting [x]’s relationship with her father, and a 5/9 could have stayed.
mr hall: all right. but let’s just focus on the part of that where you’re talking about [x]’s – i will describe it as this – [x]’s resilience in terms of the strength and the durability of her relationship with her father, that if the mother were to say something that was critical, or whatever, she brushes if off, she actually said that, and you reported that?---when she calls him names? yes. doesn’t that contra-indicate this thesis that she needs to have more time with the father, because otherwise, you know, she’s going to stop wanting to see her dad altogether? that evidence directly contradicts that thesis?---i think – well, because that’s at this point in time, but it’s not taking into account the developmental tasks of the future in terms of adolescence, and adolescence, as i said, is a risk period for depression for [x], and it’s also a risk period in terms of when they develop a natural affinity for one parent or another. like she has already got it for her mum, but that pull is there, and i’m worried that without significant and substantial time to protect her view of her father, that it will be impacted on negatively. you’re pressing against an open door if you think there should be substantial and significant time, because that’s the mother’s proposal. there’s not even a dispute about whether the child should have substantial and significant time with the father, do you understand that?---sure. right?---i think she needs more, that’s my opinion. yes?---yes.
yes?---so the example of the dog, [h]: so [h] is a very important thing – being – in [x]’s life, and i don’t know how it happened, but for some reason [x] had the dog at – [h], which is in the mother’s home, at the dad’s house. [x] then did a different activity, i think she went with her uncle’s partner, or something, on the dad’s side – went shopping, something – whatever the reason, she was not there upon return of the dog. now, the mother yelled at her for that, according to [x] – the mother yelled at her for that, and [x] said, “i thought it was fine. i thought that dad could look after a dog, but now mum’s yelled at me and she’s made me question whether or not he can, and she yelled at me, and she told me that it was my responsibility, she didn’t know where i was, so she was worried about me,” and because the dad and [ms d] are not capable of looking after [h], so it wasn’t a responsible thing to do. but it was only after the conversation with the mother that [x] formed that opinion. initially she was fine, it wasn’t until she got yelled at, in [x]’s view, realising that she’s a sensitive girl – you know, she wouldn’t take much for her to think she’s being yelled at – but certainly she had then internalised this issue that she was responsible and she has formed this view that the father and [ms d] can’t look after a dog. what’s her view – if the father and [ms d] can’t look after a dog, how on earth are they supposed to care for the mother’s 13-year-old daughter? mr hall: well, my client was cross-examined about this very topic by my learned friend and she said that she accepted that the father was capable of looking 15 after the dog, she was able to - - -?---that’s not [x]’s opinion.
conclusions regarding the evidence of dr c
yes. and it’s a good enough outcome, isn’t it?---i always strive for better than good enough when it comes to our young people, but i’m probably the only piece of – you know, person in an adult-centric court system to talk for children. i think we can do better, i think [x] deserves better, and i’m sure both of her parents would agree with that.

the evidence of the mother  the mother told the court about an incident that occurred on 6 september 2022. x was due to enter her father’s care earlier than usual in accordance with court orders. x did not wish for time to commence earlier and wanted to keep to the usual arrangement. the mother told the court she pleaded with x to spend time with her father in accordance with court orders. the mother’s account, however, is not consistent with what x told dr c. x told dr c that when she (x) told her mother she didn’t want to attend the father’s home, her mother offered to pick her up from school. in other words, the mother facilitated, or encouraged x to not spend time with her father and did not plead with x to enter the father’s care, (b) the mother told the court she encouraged x to travel interstate with her father in early 2023 and told her to focus on having a nice and meaningful time with the father, ms d and f. x told dr c that her mother was willing to back her (x) up if she did not want to go and that x could stay with her instead, (c) it was put to the mother that x was aware that she (the mother) was not pleased about the father seeking extra time with x. the mother’s response was ‘i am not sure’, (d) the mother was asked about where x may have picked up the term ‘dodgy orders’. the mother somewhat disingenuously responded ‘x’s mouth i believe’. when pressed, she said ‘perhaps she feels that way given her experience’, (e) the mother was informed x had told dr c that she was not listened to in court. the mother was asked, in effect, whether that statement of x’s implied the mother had told x what was happening in court. the mother responded ‘i wasn’t there. i don’t know where that has come from’, (f) it was put to the mother that she expressed concern to x about how the father and ms d would treat x’s dog. the mother denied expressing that concern. however, x gave a contrary report to dr c (see the transcript extracted earlier in these reasons), (g) the mother was asked to contemplate how she may have contributed to x ‘s stress. her answer was to the effect that she encourages x to do her homework, with no mention of anything else.   the mother told the court she encouraged x to travel interstate with her father in early 2023 and told her to focus on having a nice and meaningful time with the father, ms d and f. x told dr

x’s best interests
need to protect the child from harm etc
benefits of a meaningful relationship with both parents
views expressed by the child
nature of the child’s relationship with each parent and other relevant persons
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances  i accept that x’s progress at school has stagnated, however, she is still doing well. she has had significant time out of school. i would not, in the absence of expert evidence, draw the conclusion that all of this has arisen because of the parenting orders of july 2022. there could be any number of causes for what has occurred, including ongoing parental acrimony for which both parents would share in the blame, (b) the evidence does not support a finding that x no longer has any one-on-one time with her father on an overnight basis, or that her time with him has significantly reduced. mr hall attempted to make good the proposition that there was less, or no one-on-one time between the father and x by reference to documents he prepared and tendered, that showed the time the father spent with x both before and after the arrival of ms d and f. i accept that the father has structured his arrangements so that x is in his home when f is present. that does not mean, however, that there is no, or less, one-on-one-time between the father and x. ms d, who i regard as a credible and impressive witness, gave various examples of the time the father spends with x. mr hall’s documents fail to take account of the incidental contact that occurs when individuals live together. those documents also fail to take account of the fact that while x was notionally in the care only of her father prior to the arrival of ms d, it is likely she was also doing her own things during those times, for example, seeing friends or engaging in other activities, and it cannot be assumed she was always with the father. that said, i accept (as noted earlier), that x is adjusting to the new dynamic in the father’s home, (c) for the reasons given previously, i do not accept that ms d is ‘the problem’. when asked in cross-examination what gesture she would be willing to make to the mother to create peace between them, ms d stated ‘i don’t think that this is a situation where penny and i can have a relationship’. that is an honest answer in all the circumstances of this case. it is more than supported by my earlier observations and findings in respect of the mother and her behaviour.   the evidence does not support a finding that x no longer has any one-on-one time with her father on an overnight basis, or that her time with him has significantly reduced. mr hall attempted to make good the proposition that there was less, or no one-on-one time between the father and x by reference to documents he prepared and tendered, that showed the time the father spent with x both before and after the arrival of ms d and f. i accept that the father has structured his arrangements so that x is in his home when f is present. that does not mean, however, that there is no, or less, one-on-one-time between the father and x. ms d, who i regard as a credible and impressive witness, gave various examples of the time the father spends with x. mr hall’s documents fail to take account of the incidental contact that occurs when individuals live together. those documents also fail to take account of the fact that while x was notionally in the care only of her father prior to the arrival of ms d, it is likely she was also doing her own things during those times, for example, seeing friends or engaging in other activities, and it cannot be assumed she was always with the father. that said, i accept (as noted earlier), that x is adjusting to the new dynamic in the father’s home, (c) for the reasons given previously, i do not accept that ms d is ‘the problem’. when asked in cross-examination what gesture she would be willing to make to the mother to create peace between them, ms d stated ‘i don’t think that this is a situation where penny and i can have a relationship’. that is an honest answer in all the circumstances of this case. it is more than supported by my earlier observations and findings in respect of the mother and her behaviour.   for the reasons given previously, i do not accept that ms d is ‘the problem’. when asked in cross-examination what gesture she would be willing to make to the mother to create peace between them, ms d stated ‘i don’t think that this is a situation where penny and i can have a relationship’. that is an honest answer in all the circumstances of this case. it is more than supported by my earlier observations and findings in respect of the mother and her behaviour.
