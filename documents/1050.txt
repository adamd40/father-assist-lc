66g statutory trusts for sale or partition of property held in co-ownership (1) where any property (other than chattels) is held in co-ownership the court may, on the application of any one or more of the co-owners, appoint trustees of the property and vest the same in such trustees, subject to incumbrances affecting the entirety, but free from incumbrances affecting any undivided shares, to be held by them on the statutory trust for sale or on the statutory trust for partition. (1a) subject to this section, on the death of a co-owner, any proceedings by or against the co-owner under subsection (1) (whether instituted before or after the commencement of this subsection) survive against or for the benefit of the estate of the deceased co-owner despite, in the case of a joint tenancy, the rule of survivorship. (2) where the entirety of the property is vested in trustees or personal representatives, those trustees or personal representatives shall, unless the court otherwise determines, be appointed trustees on either of such statutory trusts, but subject, in the case of personal representatives, to their rights and powers for the purposes of administration. (3) (a) where the entirety of the property is vested at law in co-owners the court may appoint a trust corporation either alone or with one or two individuals (whether or not being co-owners), or two or more individuals, not exceeding four (whether or not including one or more of the co-owners), to be trustees of the property on either of such statutory trusts. (b) on such appointment the property shall, subject to the provisions of section 78 of the trustee act 1925, vest in the trustees. (4) if, on an application for the appointment of trustees on the statutory trust for sale, any of the co-owners satisfies the court that partition of the property would be more beneficial for the co-owners interested to the extent of upwards of a moiety in value than sale, the court may, with the consent of the incumbrancers of the entirety (if any), appoint trustees of the property on the statutory trust for partition, or as to part of the property on the statutory trust for sale, and as to part on the statutory trust for partition, but a purchaser shall not be concerned to see or inquire whether any such consent as aforesaid has been given. (5) (a) when such trustees for partition have prepared a scheme of partition they shall serve notice in writing thereof on all the co-owners of the age of eighteen years or upwards, and any of such co-owners dissatisfied with the scheme may, within one month after service upon him or her of such notice, apply to the court for a variation of the same. (b) where any of the co-owners is a person under mental disability, the notice shall be served on the person charged by law with the management and care of the property of the person under mental disability or, if there is no person so charged, on such officer of the court as may be prescribed by rules of court. (c) where any of the co-owners is a minor or a person who cannot be found or ascertained, or as to whom it is uncertain whether the co-owner is living or dead, the trustees may act on behalf of the minor or person, and retain land or other property to represent the co-owner’s share. (6) in relation to the sale or partition of property held in co-ownership, the court may alter such statutory trusts, and the trust so altered shall be deemed to be the statutory trust in relation to that property. (7) where property becomes subject to such statutory trust for sale— (a) in the case of joint tenancy, a sale under the trust shall not of itself effect a severance of that tenancy, (b) in any case land shall be deemed to be converted upon the appointment of trustees for sale unless the court otherwise directs.

(c) where any of the co-owners is a minor or a person who cannot be found or ascertained, or as to whom it is uncertain whether the co-owner is living or dead, the trustees may act on behalf of the minor or person, and retain land or other property to represent the co-owner’s share.   where any of the co-owners is a person under mental disability, the notice shall be served on the person charged by law with the management and care of the property of the person under mental disability or, if there is no person so charged, on such officer of the court as may be prescribed by rules of court. (c) where any of the co-owners is a minor or a person who cannot be found or ascertained, or as to whom it is uncertain whether the co-owner is living or dead, the trustees may act on behalf of the minor or person, and retain land or other property to represent the co-owner’s share.   where any of the co-owners is a minor or a person who cannot be found or ascertained, or as to whom it is uncertain whether the co-owner is living or dead, the trustees may act on behalf of the minor or person, and retain land or other property to represent the co-owner’s share.   in the case of joint tenancy, a sale under the trust shall not of itself effect a severance of that tenancy, (b) in any case land shall be deemed to be converted upon the appointment of trustees for sale unless the court otherwise directs.   in any case land shall be deemed to be converted upon the appointment of trustees for sale unless the court otherwise directs.
79 state or territory laws to govern where applicable (1) the laws of each state or territory, including the laws relating to procedure, evidence, and the competency of witnesses, shall, except as otherwise provided by the constitution or the laws of the commonwealth, be binding on all courts exercising federal jurisdiction in that state or territory in all cases to which they are applicable. (1a) for the purposes of subsection (1), a court exercising federal jurisdiction in a proceeding is taken to be exercising federal jurisdiction in: (a) if the laws of a state or territory apply to a part of the proceeding because of subsection 68c(5)—that state or territory, or   if the laws of a state or territory apply to a part of the proceeding because of subsection 68c(5)—that state or territory, or   if paragraph (a) does not apply: (i) if the proceeding is transferred or remitted—the state or territory to which the proceeding is transferred or remitted, and (ii) otherwise—the state or territory in which the proceeding is commenced,   if the proceeding is transferred or remitted—the state or territory to which the proceeding is transferred or remitted, and (ii) otherwise—the state or territory in which the proceeding is commenced,  ) otherwise—the state or territory in which the proceeding is commenced,
except as otherwise provided by the constitution or the laws of the commonwealth.  a provision of this act does not prevent a law of a state or territory covered by subsection (3) from binding a court under this section in connection with a suit relating to the recovery of an amount paid in connection with a tax that a law of a state or territory invalidly purported to impose. (3) this subsection covers a law of a state or territory that would be applicable to the suit if it did not involve federal jurisdiction, including, for example, a law doing any of the following: (a) limiting the period for bringing the suit to recover the amount, (b) requiring prior notice to be given to the person against whom the suit is brought, (c) barring the suit on the grounds that the person bringing the suit has charged someone else for the amount. (4) for the purposes of subsection (2), some examples of an amount paid in connection with a tax are as follows:   limiting the period for bringing the suit to recover the amount, (b) requiring prior notice to be given to the person against whom the suit is brought, (c) barring the suit on the grounds that the person bringing the suit has charged someone else for the amount.   requiring prior notice to be given to the person against whom the suit is brought, (c) barring the suit on the grounds that the person bringing the suit has charged someone else for the amount.   barring the suit on the grounds that the person bringing the suit has charged someone else for the amount.   an amount paid as the tax, (b) an amount of penalty for failure to pay the tax on time, (c) an amount of penalty for failure to pay enough of the tax, (d) an amount that is paid to a taxpayer by a customer of the taxpayer and is directly referable to the taxpayer’s liability to the tax in connection with the taxpayer’s dealings with the customer.   an amount that is paid to a taxpayer by a customer of the taxpayer and is directly referable to the taxpayer’s liability to the tax in connection with the taxpayer’s dealings with the customer.
is the court exercising federal jurisdiction?
10.02 discontinuance (1) a party may discontinue an application or response by filing a notice of discontinuance in accordance with the approved form. (2) a notice of discontinuance may be filed: (a) at least 14 days before the day fixed for the final hearing of the application, or   at least 14 days before the day fixed for the final hearing of the application, or   with the leave of the court, at a later time.   however, a party must not file a notice of discontinuance in a proceeding under the family law act without the leave of the court if:   the proceeding relates to the property of a party, and (b) one of the parties dies before the proceeding is decided.   a party filing a notice of discontinuance must, as soon as practicable, serve a copy of the notice on each other party to the proceeding. (5) discontinuance of an application or response by a party does not discontinue any other party’s application or response.
should the court grant the application under section 66g of the conveyancing act 1919? ] the primary judge observed that the grounds upon which a court may decline to make an order under s 66g are limited (citing ferella v official trustee in bankruptcy [2015] nswca 411 at [36] and tory v tory [2007] nswsc 1078 at [42]). [63] although an order under s 66g is discretionary, such an order is almost as of right, unless on settled principles it would be inequitable to make the order. an order may be refused if the appointment of trustees for sale would be inconsistent with a proprietary right, or the applicant for the order is acting in breach of contract or fiduciary duty, or is estopped from seeking or obtaining the order (re mcnamara and the conveyancing act (1961) 78 wn (nsw) 1068 at 1068, ngatoa v ford (1990) 19 nswlr 72 at 77, williams v legg (1993) 29 nswlr 687 at 693, hogan v baseden [1997]
