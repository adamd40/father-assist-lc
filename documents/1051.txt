introduction
background
...less problematic, quicker and less distressing. [the mother] is more positive about successful changeovers being able to occur. christmas and birthday changeovers were successful for all.[14]
the parties’ proposals
the evidence
the single expert report
the evidence of the family therapist
the lay witnesses
the legal principles
the primary considerations  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
meaningful relationship
...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...
protection from harm arising from abuse, neglect or family violence
the additional considerations
any views expressed by the child
the nature of the child’s relationship with parents and other significant persons  also talked happily about activities with her mother, being at home, playing with her toys, spending time with her mother, grandmother and other family members. the recent dance competitions have been important to her, and this household has been deeply involved.[22]
...talks of their outings, being at home, her toys, [o], the dog, games that she plays with her father and the creative and art projects they do together. she was happy to talk about bedtime, eating together and generally spending time with her father. they had their own jokes, [x] was affectionate with her father and comfortable to tease and disagree/correct him. i have no concern with [x]’s care or safety while with her father. [the mother] also holds this view.[23]
the capacity of each parent to provide for the child’s needs and the attitude to the child and responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by the parents
the mother’s past allegations of risk  victor] and i communicated about this and my concerns, and [mr victor] agreed that he would seek professional help. [mr victor] told me that he had attended aa meetings after consulting with clinical psychiatrist [dr p]. i am unaware of [mr victor]’s current drinking habits but feel confident that he is now responsible with alcohol when caring for [x].[28]
the mother’s ability to involve the father in important decisions
the father did not sign the birth registration form and the parents separated on 4.2.18. the father was placed on a dvo and it was difficult to obtain details.
this is a poor prognostic sign of the ongoing work ability of shared parental responsibility and will likely require intervention in order to shift.[29]
she explained she did not want them to come alone as they were too hard, so had told [mr victor] that they could only come when her family was there as well. when questioned further, [ms victor] stated that her parents-in-law didn’t end up coming to the hospital because they didn’t want to.
denigration of the father
because daddy pushed mummy.
it is undisputed that the mother’s immediate response to this statement was to deny that she had ever said that to x, however x “stood her ground and said that her mother had told her this and her grandmother had also said the same, so she ‘knew it was true.’”[36] it is unchallenged that x remained adamant despite her mother’s protestations that she had been told this even when it was suggested to her by the family therapist that perhaps it had been a bad dream.
clearly... [x]’s comments above about what she believes she was told have caused great conflict for her. in trying to make sense of her father’s behaviour, who she clearly loves, hurt her mother. it would make sense in this alienated mindset that it would be extremely difficult to go to her father if this were true as it would be going against her mother and then reinforced by her grandmother.[37]
the mother’s inability to facilitate a meaningful relationship with the father
the service advised they would consider reinstatement of their service upon the mother’s successful completion of a post-separation parenting course.
the father’s capacity to assist with changeover
...attitude of victimhood and powerlessness has reduced his active participation in decision-making regarding [the child] (e.g. not raising the idea of pre-school because he assumed what [the mother’s] position would be). his behaviour during changeovers, which he agreed was reserved (as a self-protection mechanism), could also be construed by [x] as disinterested and could be playing a role in her reluctance. he also presented as preoccupied, at times, with [the mother’s] behaviour at the expense of thinking about [x]’s needs.[43]
the mother’s overly protective and permissive parenting
...with an overly protective and permissive parenting style, which appears to be impacting her ability to allow [x] to develop age-appropriate independence and a separate relationship with her father.[45]
the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with the child
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances
the child’s characteristics including maturity, sex, lifestyle and background
i accept this evidence.
the parent’s obligations to support the child
any practical difficulties
the likelihood of further proceedings
any other relevant fact or circumstance
...suggests a level of enmeshment, where personal boundaries are not clear and a co-dependent pattern of relating exists. this may have intensified after [ms victor] returned to live at home after her separation. however, it appears that it is a long-standing pattern, as evidenced by their shared work, shared emotional experiences and amount of time spent together.[51]
