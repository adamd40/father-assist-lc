this subdivision applies only if an issue under this act is whether an australian court has jurisdiction to take measures directed to the protection of a person of a child, as opposed to a central authority or competent authority of a convention country, or a competent authority of a non-convention country.
qualification of jurisdiction by s 111cd the provisions relating to jurisdiction for the person of a child are set out in subdivision b of division 4 of part xiiiaa of the fla and specifically s 111cd (subject to limitations in ss 111ce, 111cf and 111ch). the implementation of the 1996 convention via s 111cd imposes qualifying conditions to the very wide jurisdiction conferred by s 69e fla and shifts the focus to the question of a child’s habitual residence. as explained by bennett j in shanli:
“these rules [of the 1996 convention] give the primary responsibility to the courts of the country of the child’s habitual residence to take measures (make parenting orders) about children. these provisions are implemented into australian law by s111cd of the family law act 1975.”
practitioners will see that s 111cd(1) provides “a court may exercise jurisdiction for a commonwealth personal protection measure [ie a parenting order] only in relation to:...” (in summary): a child who is present and habitually resident in australia, a child who is present in australia and habitually resident in a convention country, only in specific, limited circumstances according with the 1996 convention, a child who is present in a convention country if the child is habitually resident in australia or otherwise only in specific, limited circumstances according with the 1996 convention, a child who is present in australia and is a refugee child, a child who is present in a non-convention country, if the child is habitually resident in australia and any of the provisions of s 69e(1)(b) to (e) apply to the child, or a child who is present in australia if the child is habitually resident in a non-convention country and any of the provisions of s 69e(1)(b) to (e) apply to the child. so, the effect of s 111cd has been to limit the broad jurisdiction conferred on australian courts by s 69e, not only in respect of 1996 convention countries but also in relation to non-convention countries. ...0 [citations omitted]
