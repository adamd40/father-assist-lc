overview
the wife's case
i believe that [mr e] holds personal, confidential information about me in the form of [mr e]'s memories (or the potential that he may recall memories as this matter proceeds) about negative things about me, such as [mr d]'s allegations that i was lying about his family violence, or the things i disclosed to [mr e] in the course of instructing him about family violence, particularly how i reacted to [mr d]'s non-physical abuse and harassment, the way he got under my skin with verbal abuse or subtle comments that i knew from past context were implicit threats or derogatory comments but may have seemed normal or unremarkable to another person..[4]
the husband's case
the law
they are: breach of confidence, breach of fiduciary duty and the inherent jurisdiction of a court over its officers and to control its process. each category has its own principles which guide its operation. the third category may be involved in conjunction with either of the first two so there is clearly an overlap, nonetheless, the basis for the exercise of the jurisdiction in each is different (kallinicos v hunt [2005] nswsc 1181).[9]
in sent v john fairfax publication pty ltd [2002] vsc 429 (‘sent’) at [33], nettle j stated:
authority establishes that the court will restrain a legal practitioner continuing to act for a party to litigation if a reasonable person informed of the facts might reasonably anticipate a danger of misuse of confidential information of a former client and that there is a real and sensible possibility that the interest of the practitioner in advancing the case in the litigation might conflict with practitioner’s duty to keep the information confidential, and to refrain from using that information to the detriment of the former client: see farrow mortgage v mendel properties pty ltd (1995) 1 vr at p 5 per hayne j, yunghanns v elfic pty ltd (1998) butterworth cases 9803497 per gillard j, bolkiah v kpmg [1998] ukhl 52, [1999] 2 ac 222 especially at 237 in the speech of millet l, and world medical manufacturing corporation v phillips ormonde & fitzpatrick (2000) vsc 196 per gillard j. (emphasis added)
... (d) a structured approach to the issue whether a legal practitioner should be restrained on the basis of the possible misuse of confidential information is as follows: (i) what is the relevant information? (ii) is that information confidential? (iii) does the legal practitioner have possession of that information? (iv) is the legal practitioner proposing to act “against” the former client or a person as good as a client in the requisite sense? (v) is there a real risk that the confidential information will be relevant? (vi) is there no real risk of misuse of the confidential information? (timbercorp at [64] per anderson j). the party moving for an injunction bears the onus of identifying the relevant information with sufficient particularity (question (i) immediately above), as well as demonstrating that the court should answer the balance of questions (ii) to (v) described immediately above in its favour. however, once these matters are sufficiently demonstrated, the evidential onus shifts to the respondent to address the last question (timbercorp at [65] per anderson j). (f) most significantly, it is common ground that each case necessarily turns on its own particular facts and circumstances as is illustrated, for example, by cases such as smirke and malone v state of queensland (the clermont-belyando area native title claim) [2019] fca 2115 at [25] per reeves j). (emphasis added)
it is not possible to address in any clear way and to come to a decision on protection of any alleged confidential information without identifying what the confidential information is in a sufficiently specific way to enable it to be identified. without doing that it is not possible to come to a conclusion on whether the information truly is confidential, to consider and appraise the circumstances in which it came into existence and was communicated, to come to any conclusion about whether protection is appropriate, or to make any enforceable order. a case about confidential information cannot be nebulous. confidential information which once existed may no longer be confidential, it may no longer be available although it was communicated in the past, it may not be material to any use which might now be proposed to be made of information. without specificity a claim to protection cannot be defended or decided on any fair procedural basis, and a general allegation of the kind put forward here to the effect that from the nature of the past legal business confidential information must have been communicated should not in my opinion be upheld.  he degree of particularity of the confidential information must depend upon all the circumstances. often, it cannot be identified for fear of disclosure. in considering this factor it must be borne in mind that a solicitor makes notes, forms views and opinions of clients and observes things that the client may have forgotten or overlooked. in some cases, the circumstances of the retainer and the nature of the legal work will be sufficient to establish the nature of the confidential information. in this regard, the relationship between solicitor and client may be such the solicitor learns a great deal about his client, his strengths, his weaknesses, his honesty or lack thereof, his reaction to crisis, pressure or tension, his attitude to litigation and settling cases and his tactics. these are factors which i would call the “getting to know you” factors. the overall opinion formed by a solicitor of his client as a result of his contact may in the circumstances amount to confidential information that should not be disclosed or used against the client. (emphasis added)
before leaving this discussion we wish to refer to the statement in mcmillan that even “a theoretical risk of the misuse of the confidential information” is sufficient to found relief. the phrase “a theoretical risk” was echoed in prince jeffri in the passage quoted earlier. for our part, we find the word “theoretical” unhelpful. there is indeed a continuum of risk from obvious to remote. in asia pacific, bergin j described the risk of disclosure or misuse as “probably real and not fanciful” (at [41]). in billington coleman j referred to “any real risk” (at [37]). that phrase was also used by goldberg j in photocure (at [78]). this is a more meaningful phrase. the consideration should be whether there is a real risk of misuse as opposed to one which is merely fanciful. to the extent that what we have said may be seen to represent a departure from mcmillan (which we do not necessarily accept), it is to accord with more recent authority and provides a clearer test.
one knows as a matter of experience that when he has advised on documents and transactions, recollections of them, although long faded, may revive in the course of the sort of close and careful study which precedes the trial of an action. and when one has conferred with a client, recollection of things said and done in conference may be revived long after the event when the same or similar things are said or done in another place.[13]  t has long been recognised that a solicitor who, with the best will in the world, is determined not to make use of one client's confidential information for the benefit of another client may still subconsciously draw on that information to the disadvantage of the former.
in kallinicos v hunt [2005] nswsc 1181, (2005) 64 nswlr 561 at [76], brereton j summarised the relevant principles in the following way: during the subsistence of a retainer, where the court’s intervention to restrain a solicitor from acting for another is sought by an existing client of the solicitor, the foundation of the court’s jurisdiction is the fiduciary obligation of a solicitor, and the inescapable conflict of duty which is inherent in the situation of acting for clients with competing interests (prince jefri bolkiah). once the retainer is at an end, however, the court’s jurisdiction is not based on any conflict of duty or interest, but on the protection of the confidences of the former client (unless there is no real risk of disclosure) (prince jefri bolkiah). after termination of the retainer, there is no continuing (equitable or contractual) duty of loyalty to provide a basis for the court’s intervention, such duty having come to an end with the retainer (prince jefri bolkiah, belan v casey, photocure asa, british american tobacco australia services ltd, asia pacific telecommunications ltd, contra spincode, mcveigh, sent). however, the court always has inherent jurisdiction to restrain solicitors from acting in a particular case, as an incident of its inherent jurisdiction over its officers and to control its process in aid of the administration of justice (everingham v ontario, black v taylor, grimwade v meagher, newman v phillips fox, mitchell v pattern holdings, spincode pty ltd, holborow, williamson v nilant, bowen v stott, law society v holt). prince jefri bolkiah does not address this jurisdiction at all. belan v casey and british american tobacco are not to be read as supposing that prince jefri bolkiah excludes it. asia pacific telecommunications ltd appears to acknowledge its continued existence. the test to be applied in this inherent jurisdiction is whether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a legal practitioner should be prevented from acting, in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the due administration of justice, including the appearance of justice (everingham v ontario, black v taylor, grimwade v meagher, holborow, bowen v stott, asia pacific telecommunications ltd). the jurisdiction is to be regarded as exceptional and is to be exercised with caution (black v taylor, grimwade v meagher, bowen v stott). due weight should be given to the public interest in a litigant not being deprived of the lawyer of his or her choice without due cause (black v taylor, grimwade v meagher, williamson v nilant, bowen v stott). the timing of the application may be relevant, in that the cost, inconvenience or impracticality of requiring lawyers to cease to act may provide a reason for refusing to grant relief (black v taylor, bowen v stott). in mumbin at [39], griffiths j stated (emphasis in original): the relevant principles which guide the exercise of the court’s separate discretion are broadly as follows:   the court has an inherent jurisdiction to ensure the due administration of justice, to protect the integrity of the judicial process and to restrain legal practitioners from acting in a particular case as part of its supervisory jurisdiction (see, for example, grimwade v meagher [1995] vicrp 28, [1995] 1 vr 446 at 452 per mandie j and dealer support services pty ltd v motor trades association of australia ltd [2014] fca 1065, 228 fcr 252 at [37] per beach j). (b) the test to be applied is whether a fair-minded, reasonably informed member of the public might conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a solicitor be prevented from acting in the interests of the protection of the integrity of the judicial process and the appearance of justice (i prefer this formulation of the principle, as opposed to the use of the term “would”: see timbercorp at [62] per anderson j and the cases cited therein, as opposed to the different formulation adopted by beach j in dealer support services at [94], upon which the jawoyn claim applicant relied, but i would regard even that higher standard to have been met in the circumstances here). (c) due weight must be given to the public interest in a client not being deprived of the legal practitioner of its choice, however, this important value can be over-ridden in an appropriate case (dealer support services at [95] per beach j). (d) this basis for disqualification is not discharged by it simply being demonstrated that there is no risk of the misuse of confidential information (dealer support services at [96] per beach j). (e) this basis for disqualification is an “exceptional one” and is “to be exercised with appropriate caution” (geelong school supplies pty ltd v dean [2006] fca 1404, 237 alr 612 at [35] per young j). (f) a legal practitioner may be restrained from acting in a matter not only where the practitioner has a conflict of interest viz a viz a former client, but also viz a viz a person who is “as good as” a client (macquarie bank ltd v myer [1994] vicrp 22, [1994] vr 350 at 359 per j d phillips j).
it will be observed that there is a difference between the summaries of principles made by brereton and griffiths jj in that brereton j considered that the test was whether a reasonably informed member of the public would conclude that the proper administration of justice requires that a legal practitioner be prevented from acting, whereas griffiths j considered it sufficient if such a person might so consider. the test as formulated by griffiths j conforms or coheres more closely with the test for apprehended bias. as mentioned earlier, this ground does not depend upon a conclusion of risk of misuse of confidential information. i have concluded that there is such a risk. asking what a fair minded reasonably informed member of the public would say of the requirements of the administration of justice in this case, if told of the events that i have described earlier including that confidential information had been disclosed, my conclusion is that a fair minded member of the public would say that ms chrysanthou should not act for mr porter in mr porter’s defamation proceedings. (emphasis added)
the first category stated in osferatu — breach of confidence
what is the relevant information?
‘knowledge about me’,[19] ‘very personal, very distressing details [of family violence]. he saw me at one of the most vulnerable times of my life, when i was very afraid’,[20] ‘[[mr d]'s] attacks on my credibility’,[21] ‘personal, confidential information about me in the form of [mr e]'s memories (or the potential that he may recall memories as this matter proceeds) about negative things about me, such as [mr d]'s allegations that i was lying about his family violence, or the things i disclosed to [mr e] in the course of instructing him about family violence, particularly how i reacted to [mr d]'s non-physical abuse and harassment, the way he got under my skin with verbal abuse or subtle comments that i knew from past context were implicit threats or derogatory comments but may have seemed normal or unremarkable to another person. i fear that [mr e] will recall these details and that there is a risk these memories and confidential information may prejudice my case by being used by [mr e] in his advocacy of the respondent’,[22] and ‘the many subtle ways in which [mr d] controlled me’.[23]
the answer to this contention appears to me to lie in the peculiar quality of family law litigation to which reference was made by bryson j. in d. & j. constructions pty. limited. particularly in a proceeding involving the wealth of issues identified above, it is reasonable to infer that mr byrne, by dint of his lengthy retainer, is in possession of at least some privileged material belonging to the wife which could be put to good use by the husband. this might only consist of impressions of the wife's personality gained after many hours of confidence, which could be exploited by a skillful advocate presented with those impressions.[26]
further, ms chrysanthou’s assessment of ms dyer as a witness, and of the credibility of ms dyer’s account of the facts, is confidential information. ms chrysanthou denies she made such an assessment. accepting that ms chrysanthou did not make any formal assessment of such matters, that does not gainsay that impressions were inevitably formed by her and formed in connection with particular facts, some of which were confidential. it is a part of human nature to assess what one is told by reference to the way in which it is said and the impression one forms, often if not generally subconsciously, of the person making the statement. barristers are no exception, indeed they readily engage in such assessments out of professional necessity. this kind of confidential information has been rightly described as “highly confidential”: sent at [70], timbercorp at [79]. amongst other reasons, this is because the course of litigation, including whether it should be settled, and the result of litigation, can turn on whether or not a particular witness should be called and the credibility or reliability of witnesses. (emphasis added)
it is, however, important to recognise that mcmillan, as were thevanez and stewart, was a case where the applicant was seeking to restrain a solicitor or a clerk to whom they had recently, and directly, given instructions from acting, or the firm to which they had moved, from acting, in those proceedings. because the applicants in those cases had given instructions to the solicitor about the very matter in issue, it follows easily that there would be a finding that the solicitor who had moved was in possession of confidential information which is or may be relevant to that matter.[32] (emphasis added)  r e]'s memories] about negative things about me, such as [mr d]'s allegations that i was lying about his family violence, or the things i disclosed to [mr e] in the course of instructing him about family violence, particularly how i reacted to [mr d]'s non-physical abuse and harassment, the way he got under my skin with verbal abuse or subtle comments that i knew from past context were implicit threats or derogatory comments but may have seemed normal or unremarkable to another person. i fear that [mr e] will recall these details and that there is a risk these memories and confidential information. (emphasis added)
is that information confidential?
there is no one precise formulation for determining whether information is confidential: australian medic-care co ltd (a company incorporated in hong kong) v hamilton pharmaceutical pty ltd (2009) 261 alr 501, [2009] fca 1220 at [634]. however, it is clear that, within the context of a relationship of legal practitioner and client, the concept is not to be construed narrowly. [75] to start, unless a relevant exception applies, all communications by a client to the legal practitioner will prima facie be confidential, as explained by riordan j in babcock at [83]: in my opinion, communications (other than those about matters of common or public knowledge) between a client and a solicitor for the purposes of obtaining or giving legal advice would have the necessary ingredient of confidentiality against all persons unless, by reason of implied direction or otherwise, the solicitor was authorised to provide the confidential communication to the third party. [76] even broader, professor dal pont quotes a canadian decision which expresses that “any information received by a lawyer in his professional capacity concerning his client’s affairs is prima facie confidential unless it is already notorious or was received for the purposes of being used publicly or otherwise disclosed in the conduct of the client’s affairs”: dal pont g e, lawyers’ professional responsibility (6th ed, thomson reuters, 2017) p 345, quoting ott v fleishman [1983] 5 wwr 721 at 723. moreover, although the passing of information from client to legal practitioner is the most obvious means of information attracting a confidential character, it is not necessary for that information to have come directly from the client. the question is not who provided the information, but the character of the circumstances in which the legal practitioner received it: re holloway [1887] uklawrppro 20, (1887) 12 pd 167 at 171. [38]
does the legal practitioner have possession of that information?
ms chrysanthou said she cannot remember any confidential information being disclosed. she also stated that she has not retained emails that she sent or received and, in relation to some of those emails, that she does not recall receiving or reading those emails. the question, accordingly, arises as to whether she is relevantly in possession of confidential information. the duty of confidentiality attaches to information disclosed to a lawyer within the confines of a lawyer-client relationship. the fact that ms chrysanthou does not presently recollect the information does not mean that she is not in possession of confidential information. as nettle j observed in sent at [89]:
one knows as a matter of experience that when he has advised on documents and transactions, recollections of them, although long faded, may revive in the course of the sort of close and careful study which precedes the trial of an action.
ms chrysanthou is relevantly in possession of confidential information irrespective of whether or not she presently recalls the content of it.[41] (emphasis added)
is mr e proposing to act “against” the wife?
is there a real risk that the confidential information will be relevant?
i believe that [mr e] holds personal, confidential information about me in the form of [mr e]'s memories (or the potential that he may recall memories as this matter proceeds) about negative things about me... i fear that [mr e] will recall these details and that there is a risk these memories and confidential information may prejudice my case by being used by [mr e] in his advocacy of the respondent.[42]
and at [13]:   d] was a very controlling and manipulative person. i discussed the many subtle ways in which [mr d] controlled me with [mr e] when he was my lawyer. the respondent was also controlling to me during our relationship and after we separated. this is very relevant to any property proceedings as it goes to the issue of why the respondent refused to put my name on the certificate of title for the property, despite my considerable financial contributions to the mortgage or to renovations, and any discussions we may have at mediation or in negotiation about our respective contributions to the assets of the relationship.  the solicitor's impressions of the applicant and knowledge that may be refreshed or recalled during these proceedings presents a significant risk of a breach of the duty of confidentiality, which cannot be suitably rectified with information barriers or undertakings, and (b)the current matter also involves allegations of coercion, control and intimidation, making the past information directly relevant to the present matter, which increases the risk that information may be used, even subconsciously, in the preparation of the respondent's case for mediation or trial, and the perception that it is inappropriate for her former lawyer to 'take up the cudgels' against her.[43]
the applicant relies on what she describes as the factual similarity between the respondent's conduct and that of [mr d]. the only way in which that conduct of the respondent is said by the applicant to be relevant to the current matter is to explain the absence of her name on the title to the respondent's property which he owned prior to the commencement of the relationship. this is not a consideration that is of any moment in the resolution of proceedings. the absence of the applicant's name on the title will not inhibit this court from considering the relative contributions of each of the parties and making an adjustment accordingly. there is no suggestion in the applicant's affidavits that the respondent's alleged conduct is otherwise relevant to the assessment of the parties' relative contributions to the property pool, for example, in the sense explained in kennon and kennon. it is difficult to see how issues of family violence and the credibility of the applicant's allegations are at all material to the present matter let alone able to be leveraged by the respondent to the applicant's detriment.[44]
the plaintiff did not herself give evidence in these proceedings and no evidence establishes in a specific way that any confidential information, or indeed any specific information was furnished to the lawyers...the view that some confidential or other information which it is appropriate for the court to protect was communicated to those lawyers is left to inference from the fact that they acted for the companies and in some cases for mr mancini in various pieces of legal business...it is also left to inference that it is likely that those lawyers will be in a position to use some of that information while acting for mr mancini in the proceedings.[49] (emphasis added)
it is clear that the wife need not, for obvious reasons, divulge in her evidence the confidential information she asserts is held by the solicitor she is trying to restrain. however, for evidence to be persuasive and cogent she should have identified the nature of the information received or likely to have been received by mr f between 24 june 2011 and february 2012 that was now, or could now be, relevant to the current proceedings. she did not do so. it is not sufficient to say that, as family law proceedings cover a range of matters, any information at all received by mr f could have been relevant. this was especially so given that three years had passed since he could have received any information and both sets of substantive proceedings (parenting and property) had resolved.[51] (emphasis added)
by way of contrast, it would be hard to imagine litigation involving more complex factual issues than a contested property proceeding in this jurisdiction involving valuable property of the nature and to the value of the assets at stake in these proceedings... a property proceeding under section 79 of the act involves the exercise of the court's discretion on the basis of factual findings related to the classes of contribution referred to in sub-sections 79(4)(a)(b) and (c) of the act, as well as the various section 75(2) factors imported by section 79(4)(e). the court will be required, inter alia, to evaluate the wife's indirect contribution made in the capacity of homemaker and parent: mallet v. mallet [1984] hca 21, (1984) flc 91-507. this will involve the court in a wide ranging factual inquiry into the financial history of the parties' long marriage, the parties' own financial conduct, and matters going to their respective contributions to the welfare of their family. these are highly sensitive issues, and the passions which such litigation can and does excite are well known in this jurisdiction.[60] (emphasis added)
it seems natural that a particularly careful view would be taken in family law business, as such litigation tends to be about highly confidential facts and a very wide range of facts and circumstances can conceivably be relevant, the sensitivity which even the most reasonable people feel about such litigation when they are engaged in it calls for careful measures to secure not only that justice is done but also that it is apparent that it is done, an appearance which would not survive any general impression that lawyers can readily change sides. (emphasis added)
is there no real risk of misuse of the confidential information
it is insufficient to focus solely on whether specific aspects of the confidential information will or might be disclosed during the conduct of the proceedings the subject of the proposed retainer. absent consent to disclosure by the former client, the duty on the barrister to preserve confidentiality is unqualified. it is a duty to keep the information confidential, not to take reasonable steps to do so. the issue of risk of misuse cannot be approached narrowly. to do so would be incongruent with the breadth of the duty, which encompasses “all communications made by the client about his affairs, and information learnt directly or indirectly about the client, in the course of the professional relationship”: unioil international pty ltd v deloitte touche tohmatsu (1997) 17 war 98 (at 108 per ipp j). it is not good enough to adopt some form of “wait and see” approach as to whether confidential material will be disclosed though the ordinary incident of future document or information disclosure procedures.[64] (emphasis added)
the first reason for that is that there is also a real and sensible risk that ms chrysanthou would use confidential information (being information not otherwise in the public domain) obtained during the conference without realising that what was said in the conference was the source of that information. ms chrysanthou states she does not recall what was said during the conference. it follows that there is also a risk that she might use information obtained during the conference without appreciating its source... a second reason is that, if she did later recall what was said during the conference, the present issue might be revived. it might be that the nature of the information recollected is of sufficient significance that ms chrysanthou perceived an obligation to raise the issue with her former client, ms dyer. by that time, the litigation between mr porter and the abc and ms milligan might be expected to have significantly progressed. an even worse situation would be if ms chrysanthou later realised that she had in fact already subconsciously used confidential information, for example in drafting interrogatories or preparing cross-examination of one of the witnesses called by the abc and ms milligan.[65]
the third category stated in osferatu — the administration of justice
conclusion  the former client gives informed consent to the lawyer acting in the present matters, or (b) there are adequate information barriers in operation that reduce the risk of disclosure of confidential information to an acceptable level.   there are adequate information barriers in operation that reduce the risk of disclosure of confidential information to an acceptable level.
