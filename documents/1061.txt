until the father take some steps, which he has not done, to address [the] glaring deficit in his understanding and acceptance [of his role in family violence] it is not safe for [x] to spend time with her father,[1]
and that such understanding and acceptance must start with the father completing a men’s behaviour change course. in a practical sense, the icl adopted the mother’s minute of order in exhibit a12.[2]
the proceedings
the evidence
i have read all of [ms lainhart]’s allegations of violence by me against her during our relationship. i refute all allegations made by [ms lainhart]...
and in paragraph 91, he refers to the mother’s allegations that he perpetrated family violence of which the mother was the victim:
i deny all allegations.
and in paragraph 93:
i strenuously deny any violence towards [ms lainhart] and say that she was the instigator of most of our conflict. most times, when [ms lainhart] became aggressive during our relationship, i was trying to hold her away from me restrain her so she would not hurt herself.
we shed matrimonial expenses equally including but not limited to our wedding, holidays, mortgage etc. we have always held individual bank accounts and contributed to a joint account for living expenses. i was not privy to the balances in [ms lainhart]’s bank accounts or her personal expenditure but it was our agreement that matrimonial expenses were equally paid for.
in substantiation of this claim, the father attaches at annexure “7” to his trial affidavit five pages of a summary of expenditures by him between 29 september 2015 and 4 november 2018 by way of a summary of voluminous documents under section 50 of the evidence act 1995 (cth). however, even if taken as a correct summary, and no objection was made thereto at hearing, it does not stand as evidence that such payments constituted an equal sharing of “matrimonial expenses”.   lainhart] at times would come at me with a wine bottle or her laptop or phone balled in her hand and i would grab her wrists to keep her from hitting me. sometimes, [ms lainhart] would be bruised and she would take photos of the bruises and tell me that she would use them ‘to bring me down’.
i do not see myself as having anger management issues say for the current frustration of the length of these proceedings and the limitation of time i have had with [x].
i find that the evidence of the sound recordings put into evidence by the mother and the father indicate to the contrary. in paragraph 113 of his trial affidavit the father says, “while i do not believe it is necessary, i have completed an anger management course by [ad company].” details of where, when, with whom, the content of the course and any evaluation of the father’s participation and understanding are not put in evidence by the father.
...the monies in [bb company] (cba #...70) of $200,323 is half of the current balance of this account. i hold a 50% share of the [bb company] with my brother and these monies of $400,646 have been borrowed from [d pty ltd] upon structuring advised by my accountant. if this amount is disputed, i agree to include the full $400,646 in the property pool as the monies came from my business and my contributions after separation date. if i was to take the $200,323 of my brother’s share as my own, significant tax would be payable.
no evidence is provided by the husband as to the meaning of, or basis for, asserting that “significant tax would be payable.

when [ms lainhart] left the room again, [x] looked pensive and was about to cry when her father into the room. he quickly identified that she was feeling upset and gave her a hug and kissed her. [x] smiled and was evidently comforted by her father. he stroked her head and looked at the doggies [and dolls] house. within a couple of minutes, [x] had recovered her composure and returned to play with the dolls’ house with her father. over the next two hours, [mr ellinson] was observed to be a consistent, containing present support [x] ...[x] remained relaxed, happy and enthusiastic in their ongoing play...the mother...recognised that [x] was enjoying the interactions...[ms lainhart] acknowledged that she saw no evidence of distress or discomfort.
when again taken to the positive interactions between [x] and her father, [ms lainhart] commented, “he would have prepped for this in finite detail.” she emphasised that, ultimately, there needed to be an arrangement that worked for [x].
the contested allegations do not alter the view that [x] will benefit from regular unsupervised contact with her father while remaining in the primary care of her mother.
...immediate implementation of unsupervised contact arrangements to be gradually increased by small increments to enable alternate weekend contact with the father once [x] is of school-age.
the key issue of family violence has been the subject of considerable additional material provided by the mother and has been the subject of cross-examination. based on that additional material, it is my view that there has been significant family violence which has been traumatising to the mother and that the mother provides extensive additional material to the court. in my report, i made it clear that it is not a matter for me to make such findings. and so, given that the proceedings – the criminal proceedings had been suspended, it was my understanding that there had been no finding in that regard. based on the additional material that i have read and the father’s responses when cross-examined regarding this, it is my understanding that there was a highly volatile relationship experienced between the parties, that there were physical altercations between the parties, that there has been evidence produced in court by the mother to support her allegations. that has been put to the father in cross-examination in which he reluctantly acknowledges aspects of what had occurred. it was my view, based on what i read, with regard to the father’s responses to the issues put, that he was highly reluctant to make such acknowledgements. and the degree of volatility and physicality and verbal abuse and physical abuse which was experienced by the mother, perpetrated by the father, as i understand it, based on the additional information that i’ve been provided with, does alter my view on the arrangements for the, with regard to future parenting arrangements for the child. it further highlights the reason for the mother’s continued hypervigilance regarding the child’s contact with the father and it is evident from the additional material that the child has picked up on the mother’s hypervigilance and responses, which would necessarily result in the difficulties which have continued with regard to the capacity of these parents to make appropriate arrangements with each other. certainly under such circumstances, i would not view it as appropriate to continue with an arrangement of shared parental responsibility as i had previously recommended. further, it highlights the difficulties for negotiating contact for the child, given the history of the volatile relationship and family violence that has been evident. and that it has not been possible to proceed with the arrangements that i had recommended at the time of my assessment, namely, that it would be safe and appropriate to proceed with unsupervised contact and arrangements for greater care in the home of the father. it was evident that the mother has felt – continues to feel that such arrangements would be unsafe and that she has been hyper‑vigilant in that regard. the child has picked up on that and has reacted accordingly. and there has been – despite previously there having been positive contact, that has not continued in a comfortable manner, partly because of the nature of the child’s experience in her communication with the mother. and so we see a very challenging situation for this child. and certainly there has been, in my view, significant stress experienced by the child in the context of the ongoing current arrangements. ... ... given the mothers reported experience, it is understandable that she is hyper‑vigilant and anxious regarding the child’s experience with the father. given the ongoing difficulties in negotiating the contact arrangements, it makes sense that she does not feel comfortable in the child having unsupervised contact.
... cross the gamut of the forms of family violence ... from the straight out physically and verbally abusive to the controlling and coercive.
no. i think there are problems with no contact in that [x] would miss out on knowing that her father was motivated to express his love and concern for his daughter. i think it would be helpful for her to have an awareness of her father.
a pathway where the mother can feel comfortable and safe regarding [x]’s contact with the father where the father could have less restrictive contact with the child and where that could be arranged in a more normal setting without there being the involvement of a professional supervision service.
if it is [x]’s experience that the father did use the limited contact to berate the mother as she fears, it is my view that [x] will vote with her feet to not have further contact.
for several hours ... either a morning or an afternoon on a weekend. it would be best arranged at a time and likely to interfere with extracurricular activities that [x] might be attending. so perhaps on a sunday rather than a saturday. if such an arrangement was progressing well and everything settled down, he could extend to overnight contact.
it is my view that the mother has been anxious and hyper-vigilant, and of those circumstances it is likely that a child approaching five years of age would read that in the mother’s demeanour, irrelevant of what the mother may say or how, you know – the mother may say, “come on. it’s time to go”, but if the mother is looking anxious and – and distressed or uncertain is likely that the child will read that in the mother’s expression and that a child may therefore be reluctant to separate. clearly that would be increased in the context of separation anxiety if the mother – the – the more anxious the mother is, the more likely the child is to be insecure about separating and going on contact visits. and, indeed, in this particular circumstance i have read significant material indicating that the mother had been concerned about the adequacy of the supervision, making complaints about the appropriateness of the supervision and the nature of the notetaking and so on. and so i think that would be a significant factor in why the child may find it difficult to be handed over from the mother to the father by the supervisor.
the law – parenting issues  whether the child spending equal time with each parent would be in the best interest of the child,[11] and (b) whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[12]   whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[12]
a discretionary judgment concerning the parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[14]   assess whether that risk is an acceptable risk or an unacceptable risk, (2) if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.  ] in considering an allegation of sexual abuse, the court should not make a positive finding that the allegation is true unless the court is so satisfied according to the civil standard of proof, with due regard to the factors mentioned in briginshaw v briginshaw [1938] hca 34, (1938) 60 clr 336 at 362 ... [23] no doubt there will be some cases in which the court is able to come to a positive finding that the allegation is well-founded. in all but the most extraordinary cases, that finding will have a decisive impact on the order to be made respecting custody and access. there will be cases also in which the court has no hesitation in rejecting the allegation as groundless ... [24] in resolving the wider issue the court must determine whether on the evidence there is a risk of sexual abuse occurring if custody or access be granted and assessing the magnitude of that risk. after all, in deciding what is in the best interests of a child, the family court is frequently called upon to assess and evaluate the likelihood or possibility of events or occurrences which, if they come about, will have a detrimental impact on the child's welfare. the existence and magnitude of the risk of sexual abuse, as with other risks of harm to the welfare of a child, is a fundamental matter to be taken into account in deciding issues of custody and access. in access cases, the magnitude of the risk may be less if the order in contemplation is supervised access ... [25] ... in devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. to achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse.  1] ... we accept as a matter of practice, a trial judge will almost inevitably be required in a case where sexual abuse allegations are raised to consider whether abuse has been proven on the balance of probabilities as well as considering whether or not an unacceptable risk of abuse exists ...  ] in his recent paper entitled ‘unacceptable risk – a return to basics’ the hon. john fogarty a.m. set out his summary of the principles emerging from m and m as follows:
1 the decisive issue is and always remains the best interests of that child. all other issues are subservient. 2 the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable. 3 where past abuse of a child is alleged it is usually neither necessary nor desirable to reach a definitive conclusion on that issue. where, however, that is done the briginshaw civil standard of proof applies. 4 the circumstance, if it be so, that the allegation of past abuse is not proved in accordance with briginshaw, does not impede reliance upon those circumstances in determining whether there is an unacceptable risk. 5 the concentration in these cases should normally be upon the question whether there is an unacceptable risk to the child. 6 the onus of proof in reaching that conclusion is the ordinary civil standard. 7 but the components which go to make up that conclusion need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of unacceptable risk from the accumulation of factors, none or some only of which, are proved to that standard.
and thereafter expanded some points contained in the summary.  ] frequently, (i would respectfully venture, too frequently) “risk” is referred to as an all-embracing term, a “general” finding of which can (purportedly) be seen to have some form of “ipso facto consequences” for the orders made. yet, “risk” is, without more, but a convenient description, orders must, surely, address its constituent components which must, axiomatically, vary according to the circumstances of each case. [72] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said:
risk assessment in any situation involves, in essence, the asking of the following questions: (1) what harmful outcome is potentially present in this situation? (2) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (3) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (4) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (5) what measures are available whose deployment could mitigate the risks that are probable? (b. mahendra, 'psychiatric risk assessment in family and child law' (2008) 38 family law 569).  ] mr fogarty, writing in the australian journal of family law said this (20 ajfl 249 at 254-5):
... the reality is that all courts deal with issues of "risk" and degrees of risk (however described) in various situations and that concept is increasingly used in legislation. risk is difficult to define in a way which is not ultimately circular. but it is an inevitable part of life at all its levels. it is inherently risky to breathe, eat, drink, walk, drive, work, invest and play. the world is full of different risks and consequences and everyone is prone to dangers. we confront varying levels of risk everyday. people frequently face potentially dangerous situations, not many live at home in complete isolation to avoid getting in harms way. most people try to avoid what they perceive to be risk, some willingly take on high risk activities. risk involves two component, the degree of "likelihood" of the happening of an event, and the possible consequences (good or bad) if it does [cases and citations omitted]. individuals in their assessment of some risks may focus more on one than the other of these components. but at some point it usually becomes necessary for that person to make a judgment of the risk and whether it can/should be taken. where the risk relates to a third person to whom one owes a responsibility, it is likely in the nature of things that the estimate will be conservative. risks are relative and usually involve trade-offs. crossing the road with oncoming traffic to catch the last connection to the airport involves the risk of being hit by a car or the risk of missing the plane. very much a balancing exercise of facts, experience and intuition, but essentially which risk carries the greater detriment (usually the car). then there is the common experience of a mother watching her child cross a road to go to school. the risk is seen as greater (although it may not be) because the consequences may be death or injury to the child and because the responsibilities of the mother will be seen by her as greater than for herself or another adult .... at times the courts and the legislature have attempted to give an indication of the content or quality of the risk -- otherwise “risk” may mean any risk, however small or unlikely. hence the use of adjectives such as “serious”, “grave”, “real”, “appreciable” and “unacceptable”.  ] i respectfully agree, as i also do with mr fogarty's statement (which also has echoes in the english author's statement earlier quoted) that:
... unacceptable risk in the high court's formulation [in m v m (1988) 166 clr 69] requires two separate steps. is there a risk, and is it unacceptable? the concentration by the high court is upon both the nature and the degree of risk in the particular case. its formulation is all about balance. in some cases a risk is "acceptable" when balanced against other factors and other orders. the object of safeguards is to convert an unacceptable situation to an acceptable one where that is feasible and is of "benefit to the child". it is, as i suggested earlier, calibrated to its use in individual cases. it is unrelated to the exoneration or otherwise of the alleged abuser, it is all about the bests interests of the child and protection from risk

conclusions in relation to parenting issues  the father has understood and accepted that during and after their relationship he had significant anger management problems that led to him perpetrating physical and psychological family violence upon the mother, and (2) the father has gained understanding of the need to manage his anger so as to eliminate any unacceptable risk to x of outbursts of anger by the father while she is in his care for any period of time.   the father has gained understanding of the need to manage his anger so as to eliminate any unacceptable risk to x of outbursts of anger by the father while she is in his care for any period of time.
the law – alteration of property interest  the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in property, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, (b) the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (c) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[22]   the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (c) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[22]   the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[22]
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[24]   first, “the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities, and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing”,[26] (b) second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [27] (c) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[28] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[29]   second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [27] (c) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[28] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[29]   third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (“the other factors”) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[28] (d) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[29]   fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[29]
... indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis (1986) 161 clr 513).[32]  ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial “product” or “value”. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent “causal connection” might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the “...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...” or, indeed, to “property” at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to: ... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse’s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[34]
...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.[36]
as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.[37]
is it just and equitable to make any order altering the interests of the parties in the property?  item 20 – “monies owed to husband”, asserted by the wife to be an asset owned by the husband, asserted by the wife to have a value of $100,000, and by the husband to be non-existent and therefore to have no value, (2) item 21 – “monies owed to husband by his brother [mr yy]”, asserted by both parties to have a value of $200,000, (3) item 22 – “transfer from [d pty ltd] between april 2021 – september 2021”, asserted by the wife to be an asset owned by the husband, asserted by the wife to have a value of $419,420 and by the husband have no value.   item 21 – “monies owed to husband by his brother [mr yy]”, asserted by both parties to have a value of $200,000, (3) item 22 – “transfer from [d pty ltd] between april 2021 – september 2021”, asserted by the wife to be an asset owned by the husband, asserted by the wife to have a value of $419,420 and by the husband have no value.   item 22 – “transfer from [d pty ltd] between april 2021 – september 2021”, asserted by the wife to be an asset owned by the husband, asserted by the wife to have a value of $419,420 and by the husband have no value.   item 23 – a debt owed by the husband to the australian taxation office, asserted by the wife to be a debt in the sum of $35,400 and by the husband to be a debt in the sum of $55,128, (2) item 24 – “personal loan – [mr ww] and [ms g] ”, asserted by the wife to be a debt owed by her, disputed by the husband, (3) item 25 – “broun abrahams burreket”, asserted by the wife to be a debt to her solicitors for legal fees in a sum of $79,135, disputed by the husband, and (4) item 26 – a debt asserted by the wife to be owed by her to the australian taxation office in an agreed sum of $16,528, disputed by the husband.   item 24 – “personal loan – [mr ww] and [ms g] ”, asserted by the wife to be a debt owed by her, disputed by the husband, (3) item 25 – “broun abrahams burreket”, asserted by the wife to be a debt to her solicitors for legal fees in a sum of $79,135, disputed by the husband, and (4) item 26 – a debt asserted by the wife to be owed by her to the australian taxation office in an agreed sum of $16,528, disputed by the husband.   item 25 – “broun abrahams burreket”, asserted by the wife to be a debt to her solicitors for legal fees in a sum of $79,135, disputed by the husband, and (4) item 26 – a debt asserted by the wife to be owed by her to the australian taxation office in an agreed sum of $16,528, disputed by the husband.   item 26 – a debt asserted by the wife to be owed by her to the australian taxation office in an agreed sum of $16,528, disputed by the husband.
firstly regarding their personal loan and the legal fees at line items 31 and 32, we accept that you wouldn’t include those, where the paid legals aren’t being added back.[39]
i note that the monies in [bb company] (cba #...70) of $200,323 is half of the current balance of this account. i hold a 50% share of [bb company] with my brother and these monies of $400,646 have been borrowed from [d pty ltd] upon structuring advice by my accountant. if this amount is disputed, i agree to include full $400,646 in the property pool as the monies came from my business and my contributions after the separation date.
could i now turn to the issue of property settlement, which, as my learned friend correctly says, has taken a very little of the time that either party has spent dealing with the parenting matter before the court. the balance sheet, your honour, is not a difficult document. the primary distinction is the figure of $419,000 which appears at item 22 added to the $100,000 described as money owed to the husband. could i deal with the issue of the $400,000 which my client was cross-examined about. we contend it is in the balance sheet. and if your honour goes to paragraphs 116 and 117 of his trial affidavit, they appear on page 13 of 87, you will see how the amount arises. and what we have done is included at 14 and at 21, and a combination of those two amounts is a little over $400,000. that is a different amount from the transfers from [d pty ltd] between april 2021 and september 2021. those items don’t constitute a property item at all. [d pty ltd] is an organisation that my client operates or operates through. so, essentially, with the exception of the monies owed to the husband which, he contends in his financial statement, is zero, the parties are pretty much, in our submission, ad idem as to other numbers comprising the assets.
