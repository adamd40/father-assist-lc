paragraph 29 is an order that each of the parties pay the icl’s costs within three months, being an amount of $7,787 in full, so $3,898.50 by each party. i will consider the icl’s oral application that the parties pay the icl’s costs after i have made final orders in relation to parenting matters.
the evidence
i have a history of alcohol dependency and other mental health issues detailed below.
and in paragraph 11:
i have not drunk alcohol since mid-2022.
do you accept that the mother is presently sober?
to which he said:
yes.
he was asked:
do you agree she has been sober since mid-2022?
with which he also agreed. i should add, having given that evidence from his cross-examination, that he was next asked if he had formed a view as to how long would it take of the mother being sober to reduce his concern in relation to risk to the children, to which he responded that he will always have a concern of a relapse by the mother.
i feel confident that i will no longer return to drinking, as whilst i am aware that my illness is one that i will always live with, i have far too much to lose to drink again, nor do i want to subject the children to any further harm or distress.
...has been essential in allowing me to develop the stress tolerance skills and still check in with her regularly for support.
i am very mindful of the effect that my past behaviour has had on the children, and that this behaviour has at times placed the children at risk.
i am informed by my solicitor and believe that the children’s psychologist, [ms c], told both my solicitor and [mr calandra]’s solicitor that the children do not seem to have been overtly affected by our dysfunctional and abusive relationship.
i was aware that my issues with alcohol and the tensions in my relationship with [mr calandra] would most probably have had an impact on their mental health.
i am aware of the many moments that i have missed in my children’s lives due to my history of alcohol dependence.
devastating. they have lost trust in me.
she was asked if it had resulted in the children having a hypervigilance for signs of her drinking, and she agreed it had. she was asked if there was always a risk of relapse in the future, and the mother agreed that there was. she was asked if there was a serious need to be aware of relapse in the interests of the children. the mother agreed that there was. she then gave evidence that her appointments with ms m, her treating psychologist, had changed from fortnightly appointments referred to in her affidavit to once each three months or so.
...know that she would not relapse.
preferably, close to where the children will be attending school.
you and your sister are going to end up as alcoholics, just like me.
during the day, [ms tamblyn] took care of the children whilst i worked.
he then says that x went into daycare when the mother began working three days a week, and when y was born, the mother returned to work three days a week after maternity leave, and then four days a week when x was in primary school. the father gives evidence in relation to current parenting arrangements for the children from paragraph 45 down to 49 and all the subparagraphs, and i take all of that into account. this is not a ‘live with’ contest. it is an issue of what time the mother should spend with the mother and on what, if any, conditions, so i take that evidence into account, but i will not read it onto the record through these reasons.
i agree to the mother being able to drive the children in her car during the contact visits.
he agreed to the mother being able to drive the children in her car during the contact visits, based on the report provided by dr b dated 16 february 2023, that is in relation to the interim orders made in february 2023. the father says in early 2020, both children started seeing ms c at the kk psychology practice in suburb ll. they have been seeing ms c regularly since then for monthly appointments. she does not see them during school holidays, only during school term. the father pays for the sessions. originally, the appointments were organised by the mother. lately, they have been organised by the father.
from my discussions with [ms c] –
being ms c –
i am confident that [x] is able to voice his concerns and raise the alarm if [ms tamblyn] has been drinking or her behaviour is otherwise affected in some way. however, i don’t believe that [y] is mature enough yet to do the same, if she were on her own with [ms tamblyn].
he goes on in paragraph 55 to say:
at times when [y] was with her mother alone, i don’t believe that it would be safe for [y] –
as he was concerned y would not call for help:
...if she was on her own with her mum and something were to happen as a result of [ms tamblyn’s] drinking or medication intake.
i’m happy for both children to spend time with [ms tamblyn] during the day, when it suits the child with their weekly routines.
i drove the children to [ms tamblyn’s] house for their contact visit. i had not received a [alcohol test] result, as i was required, but i went to the house, anyway, to see if everything was okay. [ms tamblyn] did not come to the door when i knocked. the children initially stayed in the car, but then got out of the car, as they were concerned, as was i. [x] looked through the window at the front balcony and said, “wow, the tv is on, but the screen is smashed”. i told the children to return to the car and to wait for me. the neighbour came out and told me that he had heard [ms tamblyn] “thrashing around” at approximately 10pm the night before. he went up to check on her. [ms tamblyn] told him the racket was due to her trying to put the cat out. i was about to leave, when [ms tamblyn] came out of the house. i had been there for half an hour by now. [ms tamblyn] said, “i am fine. i just slept in due to the medication i was taking”. whilst i was very concerned about leaving the children, i did not want to get into an argument with her. i asked her to do a [alcohol] test. it was negative, and i left the children with her.
i believe that alternating weekends will work better for the children.
and in the next paragraph:
i would like to have a full weekend with the children so that i can plan weekends away.
and in paragraph 70:
i am happy for the children to spend time with [ms tamblyn] during the week, but due to their currently weekly routine, the only day that they are both free at the moment is thursday afternoon.
in making that comment, that it is more by nature of oral submission it has gone into evidence, that is no criticism whatsoever of anyone. in the terms of this matter and the risk element surrounding the mother’s abuse of alcohol and the orders sought by the parties, i feel it is important to put those expressions of intent and belief, by the father in his evidence, in.
i would be confident with the reading.
the father was asked in cross-examination for the icl by mr maddox where he intended to live with the children once the sale of the former matrimonial home in suburb e settled. he responded he intended to try and live as close as he could to where they are now. he suggested perhaps the suburb d area or suburb ss or suburb tt.
since that time, i have managed her for this condition. during the course of the initial two-week admission, she was also confirmed to suffer from the following mental health conditions, which were triggers to her increased alcohol intake: (a) anxiety disorder, (b) complex post-traumatic stress disorder.
during 2022, i have seen [ms tamblyn] on 11 occasions via telehealth.
he says:
she has been well apart from a brief lapse in 2022.
that would be mid-2022:
she got back on track very quickly and has been sober since then. she has attended hospital group therapy most of this year. she has just engaged in a cognitive behaviour therapeutic (cbt) program, namely, [uu program], through a volunteer organisation on the [l hospital], focused on addictions.
the mother was reviewed most recently on 13 february 2023.
he said:
there was no evidence of intoxication or psychosis. there was no thought of harm to self or others. she displayed very good insight and judgment.
her use of these medications was entirely within the context of her medical condition. there is no suggestion, given the doses and timing of prescriptions, to suggest misuse, abuse or dependence, nor is there anything to indicate a drugging impairment consequent to their use.
that was the report no doubt referred to by the father in his evidence, in his affidavit, as to why he consented to the order in february that the mother could drive when the children were with her.
...is a very psychologically malleable condition and it can be triggered by stories heard at alcoholics anonymous meetings.
...consistently minimised her impact on the children or denied causing them harm.
both children love their mother, but do not fully trust her ability to look after them or maintain honesty about her difficulties. this appears less of a problem for [x], who has very clear safety plans and reports that he is certain to protect himself from harm. [x] expressed confidence in his capacity to handle such situations without the requirement of external supervision.
then says:   is still too young to effectively seek help or express concern if something went wrong while left alone in her mother’s sole care. [y] remains deeply loyal to her mother and wishes to protect her from any repercussions. furthermore, she strongly desires to increase her time with her mother without any form of supervision.
in my professional assessment, it is evident that [x], now 14 years old, and [y], now 9 years old, have encountered considerable distress during their childhood, however, what stands out is their impressive resilience and capability as young individuals, coupled with their affection for their parents. it is noteworthy that both children share a positive connection with one another as well as with their parents and they express a strong desire to spend time with both parents.
though preserving a meaningful relationship with both parents is vitally important for the children’s wellbeing, it is evident that the children are secure and safe under the full-time care of their father with no concerns regarding his parenting abilities. additionally, it is apparent that if [ms tamblyn] were able to maintain a sustained period of sobriety, psychological wellness and less problematic dependence on prescription medication, she could play a more active role in parenting the children. based on my clinical assessment, i conclude that [x] and [y] require ongoing safeguards against potential harm during extended time spent with their mother. [x] has demonstrated an ability to adopt a protective role and i believe he will vocalise any concerns he may have regarding his or his sister’s wellbeing. in relation to [y], given her young age, it is still a potential risk to leave [y] alone for extended periods under the sole care of her mother. as [x] enters adolescence, his priority is naturally shifting. he may desire more time spent with peers. he wishes to have autonomy over his time with his mother without it impacting his social interactions or study commitments. on the other hand, [y] expresses a strong desire for increased maternal presence and care, as being mothered is her primary priority. the situation poses a dilemma, as it remains uncertain whether [y] should be left under the sole care of her mother. it is recommended that individual therapy sessions for [x] and [y] continue.
the mother considered her relationship with the children to have been damaged by her drinking and that they are wary of her because of that.
of course, in the mother’s cross-examination, she agreed with that assessment. ms j said:
both of the children presented as being respectful and engaging children who love both of their parents. they talked about the problem their mother has with alcohol without any evidence of embellishment, disparagement or rancour.
each of the parents would appear, under normal circumstances, to have good care parenting capacity, although the mother’s parenting capacity would seem to be significantly compromised when she is under the influence of alcohol.
and then:
the children’s relationships with their mother have not been irretrievably damaged by her drinking. [x] and [y] continue to express love for her and to want to spend time with her. they just want her to be sober, because her behaviour when drunk frightens them and leads them to feel unsafe with her when she is in that state.
the mother’s evidence that the children have not been exposed to her in a drunken state or an intoxicated state since 2020 – and this report was in december 2021 – it is not inconsistent evidence:
it would seem to be the case that the children are hypervigilant when it comes to their mother’s drinking, which is to be expected given the impact of alcohol on her capacity to function as a safe mother and the trauma associated with this for them and the children.
in reference to how she and [mr calandra] communicate to solve parenting problems, [ms tamblyn] advised it was via text and email only, and confirmed that it mostly gets “the job done”. [ms tamblyn] spoke of it being good should she and he be able to get to a point where they say hello/goodbye, and be civil around handovers.
asked as per his court documentation how long is “long enough” for him to feel [ms tamblyn] is no longer alcohol dependent/posing a risk to the children, [mr calandra] said he did not know and that he was “hoping it would be sooner rather than later.” he added, “i’m not the expert.” asked how he and [ms tamblyn] communicate on parenting matters, he advised of mostly text and email communication and occasional phone calls which “gets the job done”.
he has completed a managing anger course through [t counsellors] although he did not see that he had anger management problems per se.
asked why his current parenting proposal that the children have supervised time with their mother are in their best interest, [mr calandra] advised this was largely in relation to his concerns with regard to her dependence on alcohol and prescription medications. [mr calandra] also stated that he needs to feel confident for the children’s sake that [ms tamblyn’s] recovery is “on the right track”.
his concerns relate to their safety. he states that he believes [ms tamblyn] is a good mother when sober.
throughout much of the interview, the mother appeared to be literally and figuratively “on the sidelines” and did not appear comfortable interacting with the children.
it was hard to gauge the quality of the interaction between the children and [ms tamblyn] . i did not sense any tension or discomfort, however, there seemed to be a degree of “holding back” overall.
conversation then turned to living arrangements and [x] quickly described the supervision as “silly”. he said that he would like to spend time without a supervisor with his mother and he would also like to do so “when she is being a mum”. asked to say more about this, [x] said the presence of the supervisor is awkward for all involved and he does not enjoy it.   c] confirmed that she has been seeing the children, separately, on a regular fortnightly basis with the exception of school holidays, since approximately march 2020. initial appointments were arranged by [ms tamblyn], and for approximately 12 months she consistently got them to appointments. she explained that overall, however, the main work done in the treatment has been focused on supporting the children with the impact of the mother’s alcohol dependence. [ms c] further stated that there were “very few indicators that the children were aware of domestic violence” and as such it was not “a theme of the work undertaken”. in discussing [y], [ms c] described her view that [y] takes many cues from her older brother and that [x] has made concerted efforts to protect his younger sister from exposure to difficult situations. nonetheless, she has been exposed to “incredibly traumatic incidents”. one such incident was when [y] discovered the aftermath of her mother’s attempted deliberate self-harm, whereby [y] had discovered bloodied bandages.
it is to the children’s benefit to maintain meaningful relationships with both parents, although at the current time i believe [mr calandra] is best placed to be the primary carer. through their relationship with their mother, the children also maintain ties to their maternal grandmother, which is important for them. it is often the case that children of parents with sustained alcohol dependence want, as much as anything, a solid relationship with that parent if he or she can remain sober. provided [ms tamblyn] can do so, she could regain her position as one of the children’s primary caregivers and an ensuing meaningful relationship would result.
it is difficult to conclude that [ms tamblyn] can maintain her sobriety to the degree that the children are not currently at risk of harm, given the aforementioned recent relapses and [ms tamblyn] having experienced a lengthy period of sobriety in the past between relapses. yet, recovery from alcohol dependence is rarely a straightforward process and relapses do not in themselves necessarily indicate an inability to achieve the same in the long‑term.   herself pointedly made reference to wishing her mother no longer drank, and as such this issue is a current preoccupation. nonetheless, i do not believe the children spending less time with their mother, or maintaining the brief time they spend with her currently for the longer term will be in their interest. it is for the children's benefit to develop an independent relationship with their mother, and on the proviso that [ms tamblyn] regains and maintains her recovery from alcohol dependence, this should happen. it will be important for both children to have time with a mother who is living a life free of alcohol and is able to re-establish her parental role with the children. i concur with [ms c]’s view that [x] is both old enough and developmentally capable of contributing to decisions with regard to time spent with the mother. [x] made a pointed reference to wanting to spend time with his mother when she can ‘just be a mom’. as is evident from his descriptions of memories and experiences with his mother, [x]’s relationship with her is not straightforward, but he appears to have a reasonable understanding that, [ms tamblyn’s] alcohol dependence aside, his mother is capable of good parenting. [y], whilst she may not have the comparable number of explicit negative experiences (as [x] has) in her mother's care when [ms tamblyn] was intoxicated, was nonetheless mindful of her mother’s alcohol dependence, as was clearly indicated during her individual interview.
provided the mother manages to maintain sobriety in the longer term, [y]’s relationship with her mother could be different from that of her brother. [y] would have less need to reset this relationship as she has fewer negative experiences to contaminate the relationship. [y] spoke of spending more time with her mother and appeared to indicate that daytime contact, more than currently is in place, would be good.
i do not believe she is of an age whereby the amount of time she spends with her mother should be strictly in accordance with her wishes.
i do not believe it is in the children’s interest to experience the mother as having no significant input into the decisions on education, healthcare and other issues as they get older.
if the mother remains sober and compliant with medication, does that alter the concerns in relation to [y] attending to spend time with the mother alone, if not overnight?
submissions
the law
a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.  ] the appellant submits that, in this case as in other cases of custody or access involving allegations of sexual abuse, two issues arise. the first is whether the parent has sexually abused the child, the second is whether there is a risk, if custody or access be granted, of sexual abuse occurring. according to the appellant, the first issue is to be determined according to the civil standard of proof, on the balance of probabilities. the second issue is to be answered by reference to the test: is there a real and substantial risk of the child being sexually abused? to these propositions the appellant adds two others: first, that the primary judge is under a duty to determine the first issue, and, secondly, that, if the complainant fails on the first issue, then that is the end of the matter because the rejection of the complaint necessarily entails a negative answer to the second issue. [23] no doubt there will be some cases in which the court is able to come to a positive finding that the allegation is well-founded. in all but the most extraordinary cases, that finding will have a decisive impact on the order to be made respecting custody and access. there will be cases also in which the court has no hesitation in rejecting the allegation as groundless. again, in the nature of things there will be very many cases, such as the present case, in which the court cannot confidently make a finding that sexual abuse has taken place. and there are strong practical family reasons why the court should refrain from making a positive finding that sexual abuse has actually taken place unless it is impelled by the particular circumstances of the case to do so. [24] in resolving the wider issue the court must determine whether on the evidence there is a risk of sexual abuse occurring if custody or access be granted and assessing the magnitude of that risk. after all, in deciding what is in the best interests of a child, the family court is frequently called upon to assess and evaluate the likelihood or possibility of events or occurrences which, if they come about, will have a detrimental impact on the child's welfare. the existence and magnitude of the risk of sexual abuse, as with other risks of harm to the welfare of a child, is a fundamental matter to be taken into account in deciding issues of custody and access. in access cases, the magnitude of the risk may be less if the order in contemplation is supervised access. even in such a case, however, there may be a risk of disturbance to a child who is compulsorily brought into contact with a parent who has sexually abused her or whom the child believes to have sexually abused her. but that is not the issue in this case. [25] efforts to define with greater precision the magnitude of the risk which will justify a court in denying a parent access to a child have resulted in a variety of formulations. the degree of risk has been described as a "risk of serious harm" (a v. a [1976] vicrp 24, (1976) vr 298, at p 300), "an element of risk" or "an appreciable risk" (marriage of m [1986] famca 62, (1987) 11 fam lr 765, at p 770 and p 771 respectively), "a real possibility" (b. v. b. (access) [1986] famca 52, (1986) flc 91-758, at p 75,545), a "real risk" (leveque v. leveque (1983) 54 b clr 164, at p 167), and an "unacceptable risk" (in re g. (a minor) (1987) 1 wlr 1461, at p 1469). this imposing array indicates that the courts are striving for a greater degree of definition than the subject is capable of yielding. in devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. to achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse.
the primary question which his honour should have addressed was looking at the whole of the evidence, whether the contact or contact which was not strictly supervised might expose the children to an unacceptable risk, because although it is almost impossible to quantify in any precise way, it may place those children in circumstances of potential jeopardy in the future in their parents’ care.   what harmful outcome is potentially present in the situation? (b) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (c) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (d) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (e) what measures are available whose deployment would mitigate the risks that are probable?   what is the probability of this outcome coming about?
