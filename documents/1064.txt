issues relating to disclosure and evidence
"i believe that the conclusion of the house of lords in the case of livesey v jenkins is apposite, namely that in financial proceedings between spouses each party must make a full and frank disclosure of all material facts. in that case it was made clear that full and frank disclosure was required as a matter of principle in the light of the fact that it was the duty of the court, taking into account a number of designated criteria, to make a decision which basically involved the exercise of discretion. this is quite different from common law litigation between strangers, in which such a general duty does not exist, and obligations would only exist in so far as statute or court rules required. in my view it is fundamental to the whole operation of the family law act in financial cases that there is an obligation of the nature to which i have referred."[7]
