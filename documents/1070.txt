the evidence
history of family relationships and conflict ] ... i can recall being locked in a bedroom for hours on a number of occasions when i was around five years old. i can recall kicking the door trying to get out. [ms gammill] has stated that she had difficulty handling me.  ] there is information related to [ms walworth] engaging in aggressive behaviours including toward her father, step-mother and mother.
...within the first two days of him staying with me he had thrown his keys are me, stabbed the unit's [kitchen appliance] and assaulted me. he hit me. i moved out of my unit and into an older house as i was worried about the property damage [mr o’hare] was causing.
mother and father ] [ms walworth] reported that [mr o’hare] had perpetrated significant physical violence toward her including punching her, throwing her down the stairs, kicking her in the head, chasing her with a knife and a chainsaw, holding a knife to her throat, and driving his car at the children and her. he had also made threats to harm her. [ms walworth] said that [mr o’hare] was always aggressive and would swing from being somewhat rational to out of control very quickly. it was worse when he was drinking. [46] [mr o’hare] described mutual verbal abuse escalating on occasion to pushing and shoving each other. he said that when they had an argument that it was over for him. however, [ms walworth] would not let it go and would keep at it, even chasing him up the road if he left the house.  ] ... that she had spent nine years trying to keep out of trouble from [mr o’hare]. she had not gone to hospital for medical treatment to protect him.  ] information from the department of child safety reported that the family had a child protection history dating from 2011. there have been 12 child concern reports and two child protection notifications related to the children's exposure to domestic violence including verbal, physical and sexual abuse, parental mental health issues, alcohol and substance abuse. it was noted that [ms walworth] had been offered referrals to services however declined.  ] ... i have always acted to protect the children from [mr o’hare]. i have put myself in situation where i would take the brunt of [mr o’hare]’s behaviour to protect the children.  ] [ms walworth] said that she had reconciled with [mr o’hare] because he would beg her and tell her that he had changed. she had also had a nasty split in her own family and grew up without a mother. [ms walworth] said that she tried not to let that happen to her own children. it was now an instant reflex for her to defend herself and she was never going to be in that situation ever again.  0] [x] said "we wanted to get away from him". [y] said "we lost everything because of [mr o’hare]". the report writer had been referring to [mr o’hare] as "dad" and [ms gammill] as "your grandmother". [y] said "i don't want to be rude but you can you not call him dad?" x said "and call [ms gammill], [ms gammill]". the report writer asked when they had started referring to [mr o’hare] by his first name. the children said that this started after the final separation. [x] said "because he's not a dad to us", "[ms gammill] not been a grandma to us".
just an fyi i don’t want to speak to you under any circumstances what you did to [x] and [y] and me i’ll never condone or even forgive so get on your bike and keep peddling pay some child support instead of trolling dating sites i showed the kids your photos. they have their own opinions. [x] gagged and took off and [y] said what she said and walked away! you’re responsible for the hurt and brokenness of both of them and that’s why i hate you!
so be it if you three hate me i can’t turn back time so that’s something i have to accept i will always love them that’s the only thing i have to hold on to and memories. have a good day.
miss ya [ms walworth] you know il always stand by you even after all the fellas you go through mate. love ya you are just a female version of me so how can i be angry bbear last message from me goodbye or call now i’m ready for bed ... what’s your number or call me now before bed
been busy with kids and [mr j] i’m not real comfortable with the whole i love you and miss you spiel you sent ... ... my position hasn’t changed. you can try to make me the villain of the situation as much you like ... i’m blocking you now.
mother and maternal grandmother  ] ...i say i have been damaged by the things that [ms gammill] did to me when i was growing up and i do not want my children exposed to the potential for the same damage. [ms gammill] abandoned me when i was 8 and had very little to do with me for 16 years.  ] ...i agree that my relationship with [ms gammill] has been characterised by conflict, however i say that [ms gammill] has also been aggressive and violent towards me, hence the cross domestic violence orders.
i do not want contact from or with [ms walworth]. [ms walworth] is renowned for abusive phone calls & texts.
i want no contact from [ms gammill] between myself and her and or my children [x] and [y].  5] ... that she did not want to have any relationship with [ms walworth]. she said that she had put up with her aggression for years so that she could maintain a relationship with the children and keep an eye on them. [ms gammill] said "i do not want her anywhere near me anymore ... happy not to have her in my life, having her in my life means that i am allowing myself to be abused."  2] although the relationship between [ms gammill] and [ms walworth] has been characterised by conflict and appears to be irretrievably broken down, the grandmother did spend substantial time with [x] and [y] prior to december 2017. [ms walworth] trusted her mother then to provide appropriate care to them. she could not provide any substantial reasons for ceasing [x] and [y]'s time with [ms gammill]. this decision seems to be the result of the difficulties in the dynamics of their complex relationship.  8] the children said that they did not want to see [ms gammill]. [y] said “nope, not at all. she lives in a caravan”. [x] said “probably not because she didn’t even look after mum...not right that she wants to see us because she didn’t want to raise her and now wants to take us and raise us”...   gammill] said that after the children and her left court in july 2022, [x] told her he needed to tell her something. he disclosed that his mother told him that if the children went into [ms gammill]’s care that [ms walworth] would find her and kill her. [ms gammill] said that [x] had been upset.   was asked if she had heard [x] tell [ms gammill] that their mother was going to hurt her. [y] got teary and said yes. she had heard [x] say that however she had not heard her mother say it. [y] then asked if it was time to stop the interview yet. the report writer asked her the reason that she was upset. [y] said “flashbacks...[mr j] hurting mum”.   and [y] are little humans with names, a mother, a home, pets and their own personalities. they’re not items they’re people! little people i conceived, i carried i birthed and i’ve raised to be themselves. they’re worth so much more than what they’re being dragged through. there’s no need for any of this and they do not deserve it either and the hurt will never be forgotten or forgiven. ... i doubt any of [x] and [y]'s and my family would want to speak to you to be able to speak with [x] and [y] after all the years of history and the things you’ve done to any of them or me and the current circumstances you’ve created however i’ll let of your demands for your suitability they’ll most likely put [x] and [y] above their resentment for you. ... their living through this is not something they’ve wanted or asked for rather something you’ve demanded ... as for the shoes, no need to thank me i’m simply providing for my kids where you’re failing to do so. they’re my kids it’s my job and my responsibility to ensure they have what they need regardless of your demanding to take that away from them and i or not. ... not sure if you’ve realised i was your kid. not [x] and [y], me! you failed me all my childhood and you’re failing me all my adult life too, this i why i have had nothing to do with you amoung other reasons. now you’re failing my kids too you weren’t happy enough with two kids your failed. seems like you’ve really cared for and loved me, i was only born to secure what dad had you could take and that’s clear and obvious. no mother would ever do this. where’s my brother? oh good job there. only reason i am who i am and all i have been and all i’m yet to become is because of my parents and that’s my dad and his wife my mum. anybody can birth a life or plant the seed but takes a parent to raise the life they created. i will never stop fighting for the lives i live for! i’m aware this may not help me legally but i think it’s important for you to know the memories i have of the time you were responsible for my life are horrible, i was constantly rattled in head lice, to get a jumper or a warm piece of clothing i had to rely on dad providing those things to me because you wasted child support money on yourself, i don’t remember cooked meals, i remember being baby sat on your visitation weekends, i remember all your druggo mates and those being the only adventure i ever experienced, i remember scaling the screen door distraught to get to my dad and you not allowing me to get to him, i remember going without, i remember cutting myself on the soap holder because you couldn’t make the house safe, i remember boarders giving me more time and care than you ever did. i don’t trust you with my kids lives and you’re only traumatising them as you did to me but you think you’re doing wonders news flash you didn’t have an upbringing like you dragged me through and you didn’t have the upbringing you’re forcibly dragging [x] and [y] through. you must be really proud of your parenting over the last 30 years of my life! the best thing you ever did for me was leave for western australia. the worst thing you’ve done for me is come back to queensland you’ve caused nothing but hell. my dad raised me right, he made sure i could drive, i knew how to fish, i knew how to cook, i could ride a motorbike, i could swim, i could bounce a ball, made sure i had a proper education, met every one of my needs, made sure i had a respectable upbringing. did his all to make sure i never suffered, my parents did all of that for me. you did nothing but mess me up. you’re making mine suffer and making sure you manipulate the situation to suit yourself when i don’t think of myself i purely think of my kids. you can use all of this against me but they’re facts. this is my last message to you the rest of the communication is purely [x] and [y] related. i need you to know i could never ever do this to [x] and [y] not now and not when they’re grown and have their own families, i’ll support, i’ll help, i’ll care, i’ll love and i’ll do all i can but this you’re doing right here i would never do because i genuinely love and care about [x] and [y]. if you did you could t do what you are. ... you sent the email address through. what’s this [email for] business. i’ve got my own email address just as you have your won email address. i don’t have time for you creating email addresses with my name or abbreviations to suit ... your majesty ... in future you can contact my lawyer to contact me in relation to any contact sports, any risky activities where my kids can be physically hurt, activities such as the one you are allowing tomorrow [sports] can be fatal if you do not know what you are doing or the animal chooses to react in uncontrollable ways, i do not know the [animal] therefore i can’t assess if my daughter is safe to partake in the activity and you wouldn’t have a clue about [sports] so how can you make that judgment, you’re doing it because you know i’ve taught my kids all they know about [animals] and this is considered a major decision so prior to you undermining my parenting or ability to parent you can in future discuss these things given you’re not even their parent. [sports]?! what was your motive when you thought of [sports]? oh that’s mine and my daughters that’s why! you’re not trained and you do not have adequate experience or knowledge. does the owner have liability insurance? is my daughter safe? you have no training, no knowledge of livestock or experience and that animal has a mind of its own! i’m not going to shatter her excitement or her heart but you shouldve used your head here! .... i will never forgive you for doing this to [x] and [y] or for taking my life and killing me every single waking day since [...]! never! if im forced to deal with you just know deep down regardless of maturity and being civil after all the hurt, this what youre doing to [x] and [y] and to me, i will take to my grave never forgiving you for! every day of ten years ive lived and breathed for [x] and [y] and you would have done better just cutting my heart out and taking my lungs!
i’m happy to go to relationship counselling so that we can both be civil for the sake of the kids. i refuse to repair the relationship. it’s done. i don’t want a relationship with that woman. i do no longer trust her. after what she has put my kids through, what she has put me through, the amount of times i’ve tried to reconcile, the amount of times that i have reconciled and it has blown up in my face. it’s a risk that i’m not willing to take for myself. i don’t need to find myself in trouble because she has decided that i’ve spoken to her how she doesn’t like or said something she doesn’t want to hear, because that’s the reality of it and our relationship.  ] ... although she did not like child safety that she would rather that [x] and [y] were in foster care than with [ms gammill]. [ms walworth] said that she had no desire to repair her relationship with [ms gammill].
mother and maternal grandfather and step-mother
the children said that they saw their grandfather and step-grandmother a lot. they looked after them when their mother had to go to court and took them camping during school holidays. [y] seemed wary when the report writer asked about her mother and grandfather having a fight. she said that they were asleep. [x] said that his mother had “a big black eye” because his grandfather had punched her in the face. they had stopped seeing them for a while “everything is ok now”.  ] i remain reconciled with my father and step-mother. they are a major support to both myself and the children. i accept that my relationship with my father has not always been easy, but my father has been there for me and has been a constant in my life and in my children's lives. ... [43] the children and i are currently staying with my father and [ms w] until the court hearing next week. my father has been very supportive to both myself and the children.
maternal grandmother and father  2] [x] was asked if he knew what [mr o’hare] and [ms gammill] were asking for. he said "they're fighting to get us and mum is fighting to keep us from going ... mum thinks they're teaming up so mum loses and they get us”.  4] [ms gammill] needs to be very aware that despite her own views about the dynamics in the relationship between [mr o’hare] and [ms walworth] that it is not her role or responsibility to facilitate the children's relationship with their father.
mother’s relationship with mr j
april 2020 to september 2020
he presented to my house in a very poor medical state due to his drug use and he directed me that he wanted to get away from drugs and from the crowd that associate with drugs and that he wanted my help or help to better himself from that addiction. i was very thorough and clear that i would not accept drug use in my children’s home and so the provisions that he was able to stay with me were that there were to be absolutely no drug use from that day forward.
i felt like he need somewhere stable and i wanted to help him. i also wanted to get my stuff back from him...it was dark when i got home and [mr j] needed a shower, food and sleep, which i helped to make sure happened.
over the next 2 days, [mr j] went berserk. he’s always crazy to some degree, but this particular weekend was just next level crazy. he was continually coming and going from my house, driving my [motor vehicle 2]. he’d make sure the [motor vehicle 2] always came back empty so i couldn’t go anywhere. he bogged by [motor vehicle 2] somewhere, causing damage. i don’t know where that happened. he smashed my phone by pegging it at the tiles on the floor and wouldn’t allow me a phone call on his phone. i was begging him not to, as i had an important phone call coming up regarding my kids. i couldn’t leave on foot with the kids. i felt like we were trapped, suffocated, claustrophobic, stuck. he’d burst into my bedroom all through the night, waking me up, making me do things of a sexual nature that i didn’t want to do, and i don’t want to further talk about in this statement. at times [mr j] put his hands around my throat and pinned me to the bed. one time, i was sleeping on my bed in my bedroom when he pinned me to the bed, and i couldn’t breathe, i was gasping for breath. he put pressure on my throat, halfway through released me so i could breathe for a bit, then at the end he kind of jolted me as he let me go. he kept spitting in my face and slapping both sides of my face. i struggled to get away from him, and defended myself on this occasion, which he didn’t like. he seems shocked that i defended myself, i pulled myself out from underneath him. he fell off the bed, and he’s punched me on the side of my face as he’s got up. that weekend was terrible, i couldn’t go anywhere or get away or call anybody to help, and then when i could on the monday morning when i finally had money to put fuel in my car, i didn’t know where to go, and i discovered that my [motor vehicle 2] was buggered and i didn’t know if it was safe to drive.

that the police kept coming to our house because of fighting, mum got kicked out and we had to go live in xxx, and [mr j] went to jail.   talked about [mr j] and said that [x] and her called him “dad”. she said that she had been really sad when the police came because she thought that he would be gone forever. he went to jail because he had been creeping up on them at night. when he came out of jail, he was going to come back and live with mum “he’s not going to be bad anymore”.   walworth] has certainly acted protectively of the children by ending her violent relationship with [mr o’hare]. however, there are significant concerns about her willingness to separate out her own needs and motivations from her responsibilities as a parent if she reconciles with her violent ex-partner as the children expect.

the best predictor of future behaviour is past behaviour. police have grave concerns that the extreme acts of domestic violence between [mr j] and [ms walworth] will continue. the children’s biological father is presently in jail and we have received [redacted] has assaulted him in jail. [ms walworth] is the primary and only carer for the children. she is a highly intelligent and manipulative person in her own right but has no insight into the risk that she is placing herself and her children by the ongoing relationship with [mr j]. [ms walworth] has modified the dv order herself to allow her children contact with [mr j] in jail even though he is not the father and was only in a relationship for 5 months prior to his arrest. the level of violence alleged with past history was such that police were able to successfully object to bail. [ms walworth] has made the children send cards and letters into the jail to [mr j]. police have done all they can to prevent further violence perpetrated by [mr j] but have no cooperation from [ms walworth]. [mr j]’s past relationships are also very violent with his own mother regularly warning new girlfriends that her son is no good and they should stay away from him. police believe that the cycle of domestic violence will continue once [mr j] is released. it is feared that future domestic violence at an extreme level including strangulation is likely to result in a domestic homicide. [mr j] will be released [in late] 2021 as it court ordered parole. he will only be on parole another 8 months after that date. [emphasis added]

drug and alcohol use by the parties ] ... assaulted his ex-partner and her friend with a [heavy piece of equipment]. his ex-partner required medical treatment. [mr o’hare] was heavily intoxicated at the time. he was charged with assault occasioning bodily harm whilst armed.
x’s diagnosis and behaviour
...in relation to the fire, that had frightened [x] to the point that he has not been interested in fire since then and has not made any other attempts to cause any property damage through fire.
after change of residence
...he feels much better on ritalin. when he is off it, he feels like he easily becomes frustrated, and angry, snapping at things for no reason. he reports good focus and concentration at school, although that it wears off at approximately 2pm. [x] feels that living with his grandmother is calmer than living with mum, and acknowledges that mum didn’t really want him on medication.
... a funny looking, worried look on his face and chewing on his upper jacket significantly. during reading groups he sharpened his pencil significantly sharp and began poking himself with it. ... he wanted my attention to tell me that it hurt when he poked himself with the sharp pencil. ... [x] then stopped doing to himself and tested the sharpness on other students. the pencil tip broke and the sharpener broke afterwards. [x] then used the blade out of the sharpener to secretly sharpen the pencil in his desk (out of sight). [x] would then get the other students to feel how sharp it was against their skin. on request [x] gave me the blade. he then found another sharpener and continued doing it.
on the attached information and instructions, it would appear that the mother is heading towards a path where the contact centre may consider cancelling visits should she not be able to be child focussed on visits, and not encourage the children to act out violently as we are instructed occurred on the first visit.
she tells me if he misses a dose of the ritalin, he is very erratic, with poor impulse control and struggles to get through routines. in the afternoons, he seems to have significant issues with anger, and lashes out verbally and physically both towards his sister and grandmother. he threatens self harm, but this seems to be very impulsive.
several minutes prior to the visit commencing, mother advised that [x] had a difficult week, had been hospitalised and suspended from school. mother further advised that [x] had indicated he wanted to go home with her and so she had parked away from the centre so he would not see her car.   was observed to be very escalated (hot and flushed appearance, verbal refusal, verbal opposition, and stating that he was going with the mother). [staff] accessed an icepack to offer to [x] as a de-escalation technique. [x] was resistant, however, the mother assisted [x] to use the icepack. [x] remained physically attached to the mother through a forceful embrace (evidenced by his strength moving her at times). ... after several unsuccessful attempts to negotiate the transition and [x] remaining escalated, the mother attempted to bring [x] through to the front room unsuccessfully with [x]’s strength and determination to cling to his mother persisting, it recommended to the mother that she leave ... this request was made a number of times as mother’s presence was escalating situation and mother was observed calling to [y], which in turn was upsetting to [y].
now [x] is stable on "ritalin" (slow release) 50 mg a day, being 40mg in the morning, and 10 mg at lunch. [x] is also prescribed "[medication]" of 3 mgs per day in the morning (just recently increased from 2mg to 3mg) and 'melatonin' at night a 4mg dose to assist in [x] sleeping. the medication i understand to be aimed at curbing [x]’s explosions. [x] has reported to me that [the medication] is working, and 'the best' medication he has had to date.
children’s schooling
behaviour: needs attention comments: [x] had difficulty upholding the school values. he attempted to follow directions in various school settings. with intensive support, [x] reflected on his behaviour choices. with assistance, he was occasionally ready to learn. this term, there has been notable improvement in his behaviour following the introduction of the behaviour management plan. [x] has had some really positive days when following this behaviour chart. overall comments: during the semester, [x] required constant motivation and found that he was easily distracted. he required intensive support to complete a majority of his school work and to participate in the classroom setting. although some progress, both academically and socially, has been made during the semester his efforts and results have been inconsistent.
behaviour: developing comments: [y] upheld the school values in some settings and contexts with ongoing support. at times, she was a responsible, safe and courteous learner who usually tried to follow the 4 b's. with encouragement and praise, [y] sometimes endeavoured to do her best in the classroom and around the school. she worked cooperatively with others and was organised and ready to learn, with prompting and support. [y] is working towards the following of adult instructions the first time. socially, outside of the classroom, [y] made positive behaviour choices with her peers and got along with different students with some support. [y] took pride in her school uniform and presented herself neatly. she was punctual to and from class. [y] sometimes brought her homework in on time. [y] is an enthusiastic and capable class member. during the semester, she showed a deep understanding of all areas of the curriculum. she approached school life with enthusiasm when the learning appealed to her interests. at times, she worked productively in both group and independent situations, but required some redirections back to the learning when she was off-task. [y] enjoyed sharing her thoughts and opinions in classroom discussions, although she required some reminders to listen respectfully to others. [y] was capable of producing wonderful pieces of work when she was focused on the task at hand. it is important that she takes teacher feedback on board to improve the quality of her work and further challenge herself. [y] benefited from regular movement breaks, scribing and teacher aide support time to maximise her learning and work output. when [y] was focused, she presented her written work at a high standard, with neat and legible handwriting. the challenge remains for her to slow down and not rush, to keep her writing legible and pick up preventable errors. [y] has a keen and natural curious disposition towards learning. keep up the progress in semester two.
video calls between mother and children
christmas day 2022
soon into the video call the children observed a shirtless man in the background of the room where the mother was staying. they did not recognise him and both children immediately had expressions of shock and concern on their faces. y immediately and with alarm said “who’s in your house?”. the following exchange occurred:
mother – i’m not in my house. [x]– who’s that boy? mother – i’m not at my house, i’m in [city mm]. [x] – no, show me please. mother – there’s no one here. [x] & [y]– i just saw [x] – please don’t lie to me mum. i just saw a person mother – yeah, i’m here with a friend. anyway that’s beside the point. mother – i was by myself to start with but my friend came down yesterday.
31 december 2023  - you know what the last boy did to us. mother - you know, he’s no different to what [mr o’hare] was. so it’s nothing i haven’t been through before. and i am an adult. [y] - you just scared me mother - that’s okay darling, i understand that. i completely understand that. but you need to know that i’m okay, and i don’t make friends with people that are going to hurt me so you don’t need to worry me [y] - you did with [mr j]! mother – it’s my job to worry about you. yes, there were times when things weren’t good at all. but you know what? i can only be the best person i can be [y]. i can’t control what other people do. i can only control what i do. hey? [y] – yes (with the maternal grandmother wiping the tears of [y]’s face.) mother – just like you and [x] can’t control what other people do, you can only control what you do [y] – can we just change the subject?

february 2023
analysis of the mother’s communication with the children 8] [ms walworth] continues to be focussed on undermining and sabotaging [x] and [y]’s relationships with [ms gammill] and [mr o’hare]. her incessant expressing of her negative opinion of [ms gammill] or of questioning what is happening to them in their grandmother's care is now creating confusion and distress to the children. [ms walworth] has not demonstrated any insight into the destructiveness of her behaviours. she has such an over-valued belief system about [ms gammill] and [mr o’hare] that she is unable to separate out her own motivations from those of the children and she has no empathy for [x] and [y]’s needs. this is not acceptable or appropriate behaviour. it can be described as psychological abuse.  ] [ms gammill] said that [ms walworth] continued to provide inappropriate information and discuss issues with the children during their video-calls. the themes undermined the children's relationship with [ms gammill] and questioned her decisions. sometimes this was overt and other times more subtle. [38] [ms gammill] reported that [ms walworth] made statements that unsettled the children such as that she was thinking of having another baby, that she had puffy eyes from crying herself to sleep because she missed them, that the dogs were old and might die soon, and that [mr j] was in jail because he had done the same thing to a pregnant woman as he had done to her.  ] [ms walworth] and the children attended five supervised contact sessions at [city k contact centre]. there was information related to the supervisor's having to actively supervise [ms walworth] related to focusing on the children's interests. it was noted that [ms walworth] dominated conversations, engaged in constant questioning of the children, tried to influence what the children told the family report writer, made statements about the children's emotional state when there was no evidence that they were experiencing what she was describing, continuing with certain topics when the children were not interested or not comfortable, did not respond to the children's attempts to engage her in what they were interested in, talked about when the children were returned to her care, made negative comments about her current situation, inspected the children and made negative comments or facial expressions about their care, did not assist or superficially assisted with difficult transitions away from her, and refused to cooperate with staff requests or instructions. it was noted “continual staff intervention required to redirect inappropriate conversations initiated by the mother. high level of support provided to the family to try to redirect mother's focus and encourage her to focus on the children ...”  ] [x] said that his grandmother did not say negative things about his mother. his mother said negative things about his grandmother "it makes me feel upset ...i just want her to stop saying things". [x] said that his father did not say negative things about his mother. [59] [x] said "i just want all this to stop".
i think they ultimately disengage. ... the thing is that with children they need to be made to feel that they’re – they’re important. and that the way you let them know they’re important is to engage in their world. so, i think, that if that doesn’t happen, the child has that sense of being not important. and this is from the person that’s meant to love them, and more than anyone in the world. so, i think, that then has the fundamental impact on their belief in themselves. so it damages the relationship, because, i think, ultimately they disengage, but also it damages their sense ... of their own worth as being worthwhile people. and that’s then, obviously, going to translate... into their other relationships.
it would be incredibly psychologically damaging because they’re being provided information that’s incredibly distressing to them ... i think that that would actually impact on their relationship with their mother, psychologically, that would be incredibly difficult and destructive for them. it already is.  ] the children and their mother were told that it was time for her to leave. [ms walworth] said “i have to tell you something and [dr b] isn’t going to like it”. the report writer stated “if you know that i am not going to like it, don’t say it”. [ms walworth] said “i’m going to anyway”. the report write said “stop”. [ms walworth] spoke over her and told the children that there had been [an] accident in [town pp]. she said that she knew that they “watch the news all the time” so they needed to know that one of the [people] who died was known to them as a family friend.  ] the report writer had previously had the hope that [ms walworth]’s actions occurred because she did not have any insight into the destructiveness of her behaviours and that engaging in a therapeutic process would assist her to a more child focussed perspective. however, the incident related to telling the children about the accident including the statement the report writer was not going to like it challenges this conceptualisation. ms walworth] knew that the disclosure of this information to the children was inappropriate, was told to stop twice, and continued anyway.
psychiatric assessment and evidence of dr m
these experiences pose serious challenges to child and adolescent development because of their impact on emotional and psychological and social construct for personality functioning. the most serious issue arising from these issues concerns self-care, anger management, emotional regulation, and controlling assertiveness.
her history since 2010 does not support the diagnosis of a severe [mental illness] recurrent self-mutilation and self-harming (as is found in [mental illnesses]) and does not support the diagnosis of the severe mood disorder with manic episodes.
the mental state examination now is normal. this means there is no evidence of clinically significant anxiety, depression or psychosis or intoxication at interview. this means i find no support for the diagnosis of an active psychiatric illness, mental disorder now which could result in an increased risk for parenting dysfunction. it follows therefore that the psychiatric diagnoses of concern which create an increased risk of parenting dysfunction are: [a] a severe and long-term history of cannabis use. a recurrence of cannabis use poses a severe fluctuating and unpredictable risk of altered mental functions, mood attention, concentration for problem solving and for rational thinking. [b] reactive anxiety anxious mood causes worry, a mind-set in which outcomes are assessed as being worse than might actually be the cause, and fear and apprehension cause avoidant behaviour, a phobic response to life issues which could potentially trigger more anxiety. this risk is now assessed as uncertain as it is very dependent on the mother’s experience of personal relationship conflicts with a potential future partner, her own mother, and the father. this risk could therefore be ameliorated if [ms walworth] [1] assesses appropriate supportive counselling, and [2] if she responds to that counselling, and [3] whether a stable functional post-separation parenting plan emerges from the matters before the honourable court.
it would be ideal if [ms walworth] could enter into some form of psychotherapy so as to understand the complex concepts i have outlined above in the diagnoses sections, in ways that are meaningful to her, based on her life history, and contacts with mental health services and her gp and over the year. this is because she has had more than just “anxiety” concerning the adverse developmental experiences she has endured, as i have outlined in [a] above. i do not believe she needs the prescription of psychotropic mediation.
and i am now of the view that the information that i have read about raises a more serious concern about that matter and the presence of excessive alcohol use intermittently or on a regular basis raises further concerns about the effect of that chemical psychoactive substance on mental state operations and on the anxiety disorder and syndrome that i refer to on page 9 of my report at – starting at line 16, where i talk about the persistent nature of that type of mental health problem for the mother, because alcohol and an anxiety state, in the context of the predisposing factors that i have referred to in the diagnosis section from (a), (b), (c) risks mental health, mental state instability, and that’s the main point i wanted to make with respect to that issue.
it’s got nothing to do with me, none of this. i’m here because the courts want me here.   m] ...i would like you to consider the mother’s presentation in the witness box. can i indicate to you that, for the purpose of considering that, the mother is not prepared to accept responsibility for the fact that the children have been removed from her care. the mother seems to have little insight into why this matter is before the court and regards it as the fault of, or the consequence of the behaviour of the grandmother and some sort of vindictiveness or nastiness associated with that that hasn’t been properly explained. she finds it difficult to contain her emotional response to the extent that, often, she doesn’t listen to the question, so she is unable to respond, and then, when she does respond in the witness box, she is often emotionally overwrought to the extent that she gives long, rambling answers which are obviously meaningful to her but don’t assist the court. on some occasions, she has been appearing to find it even hard to sit in the chair. would the things that i have said to you be indicative of the diagnosis that you have come to of reactive anxiety? well, that diagnosis is one component of the issues to which you refer, types of behaviours in the witness box. what my report doesn’t focus or elaborate on in detail is the question, or issue that i have referred to in this evidence regarding insight. [ms pendergast] yes?‑‑‑ [dr m] and issues concerning the personality structure and the basic nature of the individual, i don’t state or believe are features of mental illness, or disease or sickness, or mental disorder that can be treated, but it’s a product of the environmental, developmental issues that i referred to in the report, which i highlight, as i said, from the mother’s point of view, her account of her development with her mother, i said she conveyed to me as a form of child abuse. she said to me, “she wouldn’t even let me go to dad. i was staring at the screen door. i remember all of it. she didn’t cook me meals. i didn’t have warm clothes. i remember being babysat a lot. i remember the drugs, the drinking.” now, as a doctor, i take that at face value. the truth of that, well, it’s the mother’s truth to me. these issues do shape her personality, and behaviour and attitude to the life challenges that she was looking at and being asked to discuss in the witness box, and these are the issues that need the psychotherapy and to improve her insight into her responsibility, her role in the evolution of the relationship that she commenced that spanned, i think, some seven years or so with the father and that has led to the concerns for parenting for the children, and this behaviour by the mother in the witness box is more, i think, a consequence of her basic nature and who she is as a result of these developmental concerns but with some reactive, emotional or psychological anxiety which would then then to have emotional outbursts, mood instability and to struggle to be concise or give a precise answer. [ms pendergast] can i just ask you some questions about that to assist us to understand? are you saying that what we see of the mother in the witness box is a presentation of her personality and, although it may be ameliorated to an extent through therapy, that that presentation will, nevertheless, persist because it’s part of personality as opposed to a mental illness? [dr m] that is correct.
...the psychological concern is that the mother – based on the information available to me since i first became involved in this matter, the mother continues to be impaired. she has not been able to learn. she does not process new information so that she can present with the capacity to be more child-focused, more child aware. there are two children with different needs, and wants, and desires, and likes and interests. my view would be that i’ve heard descriptions of behaviour which would not be mild, but not be moderately, but would be severely impaired with respect to being able to change to know what she should and shouldn’t say and shouldn’t do in a contact centre with the professional assisting her or with a family member. i think a family member would be struggling to assist in that regard and i wouldn’t support that ...
for example, at paragraph 79 of [dr b]’s report, she states:   walworth] has dismissed any concerns about her own history of perpetrating abuse and neglect of the children.
and my overall concern was that, as at paragraph 80:   walworth]’s actions occurred because she did not have any insight into the destructiveness of her behaviours.
reading that, and particularly about this mining incident and this comment, at 81:   walworth] demonstrates a narcissistic belief in her own superiority.
it wasn’t anything more specific, but reading the concerns of [dr b] led me to have a concern that the mother’s alcohol use was greater than she cared to indicate to me and which is why i wanted to highlight its potential for being a very toxic effect on these behaviours in that report.
yes, it would, your honour, because, in the absence of substance use issues, these concerns are primarily, and directly and mainly as a result of [ms walworth]’s basic nature, personality structure.
yes, your honour. i would like to specifically refer to the report that i prepared and the mother’s life story in so doing, and this is a focus, therefore, on what she told me at interview, but also the way that she went about doing that, because the first point to note about this is that she started to speak with me in an assertive and self-interested manner and the overall impression one would gain from her attitude towards me was that she had been hardened, very hardened and structured and rigid with respect to coping, and getting through and getting by in life. and from a psychiatric point of view, the lay person can see my analysis, that i have said repeatedly in my report, that she has displayed evidence of resilience, that is, she has survived but the question is at what cost. and the fact, as i said in my report, that she was able to go to the school, and hardened and lacking empathy and being self-interested is a way of coping. in a sense, it’s a good thing that she has been able to get to where she has got in life without multiple mental health admissions and self-harming behaviour but, sadly, with the numbing that the substances that she has ingested has caused, including one pregnancy where she used substances, a measure of the addiction, as i’ve said, but – and so, from a psychiatric point of view, i say that people find ways to cope if they can and her way has led her to be so, not so much wooden but emotionally barren and unemphatic, and the loss of the ability to know and feel for the pain or distress of someone else, eg, a child, is part of the narcissistic process. i hope that assists.
family reports 2] there is information that [ms walworth] also has significant difficulties in emotional regulation possibly in the context of her dysfunctional childhood experiences and an impulse control disorder. she has exposed the children to her inappropriate behaviours including perpetrating verbal abuse and possibly physical aggression in her relationships. it is very concerning that [ms walworth] appears again to have been involved with and possibly intends to reconcile with another man who perpetrates domestic violence. this is not acting protectively of [x] and [y].  3] indirectly or directly witnessing parental abuse may be as harmful to a child’s development as direct physical abuse. children who see or hear violence undergo stressful and frightening experiences. this has been associated with negative emotional, behavioural and developmental consequences for the children, which may present as externalising, internalising behaviours, and negative impacts on social interactions and support.  ] during his individual interview, [x] presented as very serious. [x] said that he got to see his mother at the contact centre. it was “ok and sad, about half half” not to live with her. he said that it was good to see his mother however it was “perfect” living with [ms gammill] “we’re safe with grandma, we don’t think we’re safe, we know we’re safe”. [x] said that they had not been safe with his mother because [mr j] was there “he was very bad, mum has a stab wound (showed area on his chest), it was scary”. [x] said that his mother told him that [mr j] and her were not getting back together “well, i hope not”. [emphasis added]  0] there is a long history of substantiated abuse, neglect and violence in the mother’s household. there are very serious concerns about the children’s psychological and physical safety in their mother’s care. it is considered that this outweighs any benefit for them living with her. there are also significant concerns about the potential for the children to be exposed to or subjected to domestic violence in their father’s care given his substantiated history of aggression.  ] [ms walworth] demonstrates a narcissistic belief in her own superiority as a person and in her knowledge as a parent despite significant evidence that [x] and [y] have been harmed and continue to be harmed in her care. she lacks empathy for their position and is unwilling to consider their emotional world. [ms walworth] appears to have a sense of ownership of [x] and [y]. their value to her appears to be as her possessions rather than for who they are or what they need.
‑‑‑i found them very distressing to be. they certainly weren’t child-focused. i think there was a couple of times that i was very concerned that the mother may be of undue influence during those conversations, that the content of the conversation, the continual refocus – ignoring of the children’s attempts to talk about other things, the refocus onto what he – she considered were appropriate topics, the dismissal of the children’s distress, the continual denigration of the grandmother. no, they weren’t child-focused, they weren’t appropriate. and i know the children love their mother but i was very concerned to see how, you know, the boy – you know, how he was reacting to his mother. and i really am concerned with [x], if he continues this way, he will – he will completely reject her. i thought they were awful. and i – i – if that’s the way the conversations go, i can’t support them continuing ‑ ‑ ‑
