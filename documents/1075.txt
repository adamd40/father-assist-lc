reasons for judgment
judge w j neville
introduction
some preliminary matters   belkis] has a documented history of having had to report her ex-husband [mr farrington] to the police the domestic violence perpetrated against [ms belkis] in their relationship, last noted post separation 2019/2020. [ms belkis] reports a history of having lived in a domestic violence relationship with [mr farrington] and her previous husband [mr c]. and while there has been no recent behaviour, it is important to note that [ms belkis] has been at risk of harm from others in the domestic situation. [ms belkis] has raised concerns that her ex-husband [mr farrington] is emotionally and psychologically manipulating and abusing their two children and her older daughter from her previous relationship.
while i have confidence in the level of engagement from [ms belkis] and her willingness to provide me with information and reports of incidences – of domestic and family abuse she has suffered from both of her ex-husbands, particularly descriptions of the current situation with her second ex-husband [mr farrington], i do not have complete confidence in [ms belkis]’ reporting giving the full extent of the events and incidents. therefore, i have a lower level of confidence in my accuracy and reporting of previous events and incident details as there is the likelihood of information may be incomplete.   belkis] is involved in a complex situation and currently she is before the family court in a custody battle for the children and this has made [ms belkis] extremely cautious, guarded, anxious and stressed with regard to what she reports to me, what gets documented about her –
...what could be either misinterpreted by the court if documents and reports get subpoenaed or used against her by her ex-husband as part of the current process.   he had read all the material from b organisation and that nothing in it had caused the director-general to change the views expressed in the cyps report in support of the mother, and adversely to the father, and, (b) he had re-read the material from b organisation (quite a herculean feat, i suggest) and his views remain unchanged regarding the parents.   he had re-read the material from b organisation (quite a herculean feat, i suggest) and his views remain unchanged regarding the parents.
the cyps report
now, what happens to me if they do not go?  aning the children. the case workers says:]
you will be in contravention of orders. and what happens to me.  se worker:]
we are not police. we cannot answer that.  e father says:]
i know. the judge has said i would go to jail. you don’t know what is going to happen. if it is all about telling me – of me telling them to do stuff, they have so much time away from me, how can i do that.
it needs no immediate comment about, as it were, some sort of “threat” purportedly made by me, or some predetermination that the father will go to jail if the children are not compliant or the parties are not compliant with the orders.
at the moment i believe these kids are stuck in a flight or fight mode and they have been for the past four years. these kids are so emotionally devastated and that rewiring is going to take time and therapy. it is wrap-around supports who will be the ones to provide them with opportunity to figure out why they felt this way or that way.
“when the family report came out and [mr f] recommended they go to therapy. [ms belkis] did nothing, i organised it.”   farrington] then explained that when one of the professionals he attempted to link made a mandated report regarding [x]’s thoughts of self-harm, everything changed. [mr farrington] commented that these supports being taken from the children was devastating to them, particularly [ms g] who made big break throughs with [y]. “one counsellor, one psychologist, and one psychiatrist [gone] on a claim that i was trying to build a paper trail to use against [ms belkis].”
i think from a professional stand point it is one thing to book an appointment. the problem we have is when a parent speaks to the counsellor or whatever support before the child does. they are no longer impartial.
i didn’t speak to anyone. this is a claim with no evidence. anytime i make a decision or tell [ms belkis] or let her know, she doesn’t say anything and gives it to her lawyer, the lawyer makes a judgment that best suits [ms belkis]. how can i provide support to the kids that excludes me? icl and [ms belkis]’ lawyer conspired to organise support for x. i only found out because i asked [h]. i was happy to keep doing the counselling with [ms g]. [ms belkis] has not started the [j program]. she told the court that she had paid for it and getting ready to start it. when cyps/ [ms belkis] takes the kids, what happens then?
i have changed my opinion on the court. whoever lies the most, wins.
are you worried about the judge? “yes, he hates me. don’t know what i did to him. he thinks i am a bad dad, then ok i accept. how do i convince him i’m not? rhetorical question. but i don’t know.”
are you worried about what the kids have said, about [ms belkis], isn’t true? i don’t know, i’ve avoided giving them that opinion so many times. in the last year and a half, i have changed that to the point that i try to ground truth. when i went and looked in [ms belkis]’ bin, it was so i could ground truth about what the kids have told me. it was full of [wine and spirit bottles].” [mr farrington] then expressed that he isn’t sure if the wine bottle incident in particular is true. [mr farrington] suggested there was an incident once where [ms belkis] threw a wine bottle at him and he queried if maybe [x] thought of this incident.   and [y] and me, i guess, were punished because [y] didn’t feel safe returning to [ms belkis] last friday, 14 july.
there was no requirement for [ms belkis] to be anywhere near my car at any time. it came down to, “if [y] won’t come inside and get them, you’re not having them.”
the weekend after, i had to promise to take them [sports activities] so that they would return.
the more i think about it, i’m very worried that the kids are effectively learning to influence things by making false disclosures. while i was waiting in the hospital with [y], [mr farrington] sent me this text.
it might be your dad’s style [i.e the maternal grandfather] or the way he interacts, but it’s not the way i do it and it’s not the way you do it, and they don’t want him to be their father.
your childhood had difficulties –
that are being replicated since neither your mum or your dad know how to parent in any other way. i accept that, but they shouldn’t be parenting, they should be grandparenting, and that’s not happening.
the solution to that problem would be for you to move out. however, i’m acutely aware of how that worries you. it’s part of your lack of self-confidence, and i get that.
it will be something as simple as me dropping both brats at [suburb k].
i am not lying when i say i fear for my safety, wellbeing and freedom with this man. everything feels like a giant trap.
the children were interviewed separately on four occasions throughout the duration of the appraisal. the interviews largely cover the children’s alleged experience of physical abuse from the mother and also cover the impacts they continue to experience at the mercy of the ongoing court battle between their parents. the stark difference noticed in the children between the previous appraisal (early this year) and the current appraisal is the children’s rapidly deteriorating mental health, particularly [y], and the impacts this continues to have on their everyday functioning. in addition to this, the children’s view of the mother appears to have worsened since the prior appraisal.
i read some of her documents and she is saying untrue things about my dad. i do this on her laptop –
...
yeah, she gets up, leaves, and doesn’t lock her computer.
she goes looking through her mum’s court documents without her knowing. when asked if she would look for dad, she said she wouldn’t because she trusts him and that she hoped to find things that would give proof to dad.
at this time, the appraising case manager believes that on a balance of probability, the father continues to inflict a level of emotional abuse that contributes to the children’s poor relationship with their mother, their fear of their mother and also places a pressure on them to please him in every way they can. in addition to this, the father’s continued emotional abuse is also contributing to the children’s experiences of cumulative harm. as such, it has been determined that [mr farrington] is the person believed responsible for the infliction of emotional abuse causing significant harm towards [x] and [y].   farrington] continues to covertly inflict emotional abuse and use family violence and this is seen to have an enduring impact on the children and their relationship with their mother. the appraising case management can acknowledge that this has not been [mr farrington]’s intention, but it is critical that he begins to take accountability for his part in the children’s experiences and ceases scapegoating [ms belkis] in the context of the current proceedings. not doing so will have ongoing consequences for the children and their wellbeing.
the appraising case manager holds concern for [mr farrington]’s use of family violence. the information gathered holds concern for [mr farrington]’s use of coercion, control and manipulation as means of family violence and an observed systems abuse through cyps, the court and through police. the father’s previous admissions to cyberstalking and going through the mother’s bins and previous allegations of physical violence, emotional violence and alleged financial violence are cause for concern with cyps. the appraising case manager referred [mr farrington] to the [l] group program so as to allow him the opportunity to better understand family violence, its impact on the whole family and how better to communicate with [ms belkis].
currently, [mr farrington]’s functioning as a parent is inhibited by his approach to the litigation in the flc proceedings and this is impacting his ability to meet the emotional needs of his children.
with all of the previous factors considered, the appraising case manager is of the belief that [mr farrington] does have the capacity to meet the basic needs of his children. specifically, [mr farrington] lacks any identifiable accountability or insight into his [sic: “the”] impact of his behaviour on the children and it was evident during this appraisal that he was unable to distance the children from the custody dispute. [mr farrington]’s capacity is such that he can meet the basis needs of the children and he has a positive relationship with the children, but he cannot meet their emotional needs or keep them safe from emotional abuse due to his behaviours surrounding the custody dispute.   belkis]’ relationship with her children continues to appear very strained. ...confident [ms belkis] has taken this feedback on board and is constantly looking for ways in which she can better improve her relationship with the children, which was also evidenced in the recording – the prior appraisal also highlighted: “cyps otherwise hold no concerns for [ms belkis]’s ability to care and protect for her children and hypothesised that if the court matters and the suspected use of family violence by [mr farrington] were taken out of the current circumstances, [ms belkis]’s ability to care and protect the children will be unhindered.” the appraising case manager holds this hypothesis still and are more inclined to believe this is true. this is on the basis that the appraising case manager has seen [mr farrington]’s increased systems abuse and parental alienation, which is innately hindering [ms belkis]’ capacity to care and protect her children and hindering her relationship with them.
at this time, the appraising case manager believes that on the balance of probability, the father continues to inflict a level of emotional abuse that contributes to the children’s poor relationship with their mother, their fear of their mother and also places a pressure on them to please him in every way they can. in addition to this, the father’s continued emotional abuse is also contributing to the children’s experiences of community harm.
both [mr farrington] and [ms belkis] are willing to provide care and protection and [ms belkis] has been identified as able to provide care and protection. at this time, until [mr farrington] is able to develop a level of accountability and insight into the current circumstances and impact he has on them, it is not believed [mr farrington] is able to provide care and protection. at this juncture, it is suggested that [x] and [y] are not in need of care and protection. however, it has been highlighted that they continue to experience a level of emotional abuse deemed a risk to their safety and wellbeing. this emotional abuse is deemed to be inflicted by [mr farrington] and, as such, he has been deemed the person believed responsible for the infliction of emotional abuse causing significant harm towards [x] and [y], also contributing to the cumulative harm they are experiencing.
outline of principle, consideration & interim determination
...to protect the child from physical or psychological harm...
“family violence” means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family or causes the family member to be fearful.
it is important to recognise that the miscellany of considerations contained in section 60cc(2) and (3) is no more than a means to an end. self-evidently, they are only matters to be considered. they must be applied in a manner consistent with the overarching imperative of securing the outcome most likely to promote the children’s best interests.
the various considerations under section 60 cc(3) of the act are not a mantra to be recited in every case. only those that are in issue in the proceedings require detailed consideration. this is particularly so in interim proceedings.   the children’s relationship with the mother has deteriorated significantly and alarmingly since the first cyps appraisal earlier this year. (b) the children have been actively and increasingly embroiled in the litigation and, very concerningly, on ms e’s evidence (but there is other evidence as well to similar effect) especially while in the father’s care. indeed, there is significant evidence, including from the children, that they actively seek out evidence to support their father in the various litigious contests involving the mother in this court and in other courts. (c) the children have become increasingly hostile to the mother. the cyps material details the ongoing risk of further alienation from her should they remain in the father’s primary care. (d) again, by reference to the cyps material, some of it noted earlier in these reasons, the father’s perception and insight into the dynamic between his relationship with the children, on the one hand, and on the other, the increasingly compromised relationship between the children and the mother, and his failure and/or inability to perceive any aspect of this, including his own actions and lack of responsibility for them, remains troubling at all levels. (e) in a similar vein, the father’s lack of insight into his conduct and its impact on the mother, to speak somewhat colloquially, borders on the schizophrenic, not in any diagnosable form or clinical sense, of course, but in the sense that, again, on the one hand, he often acts and seeks to engage the mother as if they have a good and close co-parenting relationship, yet, on the other hand, his conduct and engagement regularly seeks to compromise the mother and to undercut her various day-to-day capacities, especially parenting. his recent focus on the need to pursue material from b organisation relating to the mother’s discussion with therapists is a graphic case in point. (f) rhetorically, i ask whether or why it is any wonder that the mother is guarded and seemed to be so with any therapist for fear of her comments being used against her in court? that is exactly what happened yesterday. further, the father’s lack of insight into the various and delicate dynamics on display here are evident. for example, the father regularly says in open court (i accept his genuineness, albeit that it is invariably on his terms) in seeking to promote some resolution, in some way. however, in correspondence with the mother, where he states that he can, or “we can”, settle this matter, even on a cursory examination, this invariably involves the father being the primary caregiver and the mother agreeing to his proposals. the dynamic between the parents, in my view, is regularly one of dominance by the father, sometimes subtle, sometimes less so, invariably with his assertions holding sway. the levels of control, overt or otherwise, are increasingly obvious. whether this is deliberate, coercive, and manipulative or something ever so much less grave, is something for future and further consideration and determination. again, i make no formal findings. the comments above are, primarily, just that – comments. they may also be taken as “cautions” for everyone to consider, especially in circumstances where the evidence has still not concluded and the final hearing is likewise a “work in progress” until the close of evidence and final submissions.   the children have been actively and increasingly embroiled in the litigation and, very concerningly, on ms e’s evidence (but there is other evidence as well to similar effect) especially while in the father’s care. indeed, there is significant evidence, including from the children, that they actively seek out evidence to support their father in the various litigious contests involving the mother in this court and in other courts.

annexure a observations and concerns that have informed by position of the applications filed while i have been responsible for the case management of [x] and [y], i have observed a high level of conflict between [mr farrington] and [ms belkis] that continues to have a negative impact on [x] and [y]'s everyday functioning. i hold growing concerns for the children's apparent drive to appease [mr farrington]. my most recent appraisal observed this dynamic, where [x] and [y] both stated their wish to gain "evidence" or "proof' for [mr farrington] to assist in the current proceedings. whether intentional or not from [mr farrington], it is apparent that [x] and [y] face a pressure to fulfill duties for him, and also feel a need to alienate [ms belkis]. such pressure have led to the children having adverse reactions to the presence of [ms belkis], or having to spend time with her, and this has led to an difficulty in [x] and [y]'s relationship with [ms belkis]. response to [mr farrington’s] application in the fcfcoa filed on 13 july 2023 while i note my belief that [x] and [y] should have a meaningful relationship with both parents, i do not believe that [x] and [y] should return to 'week about' arrangements. my appraisals have outlined concerns for emotional abuse, particularly in [mr farrington]'s care. i believe [x] and [y] need a relationship of some form with [mr farrington], but i also believe that the behaviour of [mr farrington] appears to have had influence on [ms belkis]' relationship with [x] and [y]. it is my assessment that [mr farrington]'s influence over the children and their relationship with [ms belkis] has a significant and negative impact on their emotional and mental wellbeing. i believe that the children need a period with [ms belkis] in which they do not have time or contact with [mr farrington], to allow for relationship rebuilding without [mr farrington]'s influence. response to [ms belkis’] application in the fcfcoa filed on 9 february 2023. i support [ms belkis]' application where she seeks sole parental responsibility. within both of my appraisals, i assessed that [ms belkis] has a developed and increasing level of insight into her parenting deficits and the subsequent requirements needed in order to improve her parenting. within my most recent appraisal, i concluded that co-parenting is not something that is achievable between [mr farrington] and [ms belkis], namely due to [mr farrington]'s apparent high expectations of [ms belkis]. as such, due to [ms belkis] being assessed as both willing and able, sole parental responsibility being ordered to her would allow for sound decision making in regard to [x] and [y], that is not hindered by an inability to reach agreement with [mr farrington]. within both of my appraisals, namely the most recent one, i acknowledge that [x] and [y] were both asked what their views and wishes are, and they both strongly indicated their wish to be in the fulltime care of [mr farrington]. [y] expressed her wish to not see [ms belkis]. i do, however, agree with the positions of both [mr f] and [ms o], in that the children remain heavily influenced by whichever parent is placing pressure upon them, and that [x] and [y] are observed to often say and do things that are likely to appease that parent. my most recent appraisal highlighted the children's efforts to appease [mr farrington]. noting the observed impact of [mr farrington]'s behaviour on [x] and [y]'s relationship with [ms belkis], i support [ms belkis]' application. ordering [ms belkis], [x], and [y] a period in which they can rebuild their relationship with one another, without the behaviours of [mr farrington] to influence this relationship and the views of [x] and [y] is likely to have longer term benefits for [x] and [y]'s emotional and mental wellbeing. i believe there could be an opportunity for [x] and [y]'s time with [mr farrington] to be reinstated in the future however this would have to occur on the recommendations of any therapeutic support services working with the children at the time and any time between [x] and [y] and their father would have to be guided by the therapeutic service. i acknowledge that such an order is likely to lead to a strong and adverse reaction from both [x] and [y] towards [ms belkis]. my suggested actions towards supporting [x] and [y] in this transition is outlined below. i believe that [x] and [y]'s relationship with [mr farrington] is important to them and their identity, and that severing them from [mr farrington] permanently will likely negatively their relationships with both parents. discussions relating to court [ms belkis] has shown a high level of insight into what she can and cannot say about [mr farrington] in front of the children, and how her children may perceive the things she says. [ms belkis] has evidenced her insight into this throughout both appraisals. in addition, i am aware the children look for information about legal proceedings at [ms belkis]' residence without [ms belkis]' knowledge. i recommend this information is kept as secure as possible. i continue to hold concerns in relation to the high level of understanding and knowledge that the children have regarding the proceedings that are before the court. both parents indicate that they do not speak to the children directly about the proceedings, however in my last appraisal the children made a series of comments that raised concern to me that conversations are still occurring in their presence. these included [y] expressing to me that she hoped her and [x] speaking to police would get "dad some more proof in court". [y] told me this the day she returned to [ms belkis]' care. [y] would also recite dates in which she thought court was occurring, and when asked how she knew this she stated "dad told me. i know he is allowed to tell me that." in addition to this, [x] expressed taking photos of his alleged injury from [ms belkis] and the audio recording of the conversation between [x] and [ms belkis] being "brought up in court". [x] told me this whilst in the care of [mr farrington]. finally, whilst on a home visit to [mr farrington]'s home, i observed a whiteboard next to his desk, which is in a central part of the open plan home. the whiteboard, which can be read from the walkway between the bedroom's and the loungeroom, kitchen and dining area, was seen to have numerous phrases and lists directly related to the matter before the court, such as "icl — bias" and "coercive of [ms m]". i believe this is accessible to [x] and [y], and when i raised this with [mr farrington], he explained to me it was information regarding his work. i pointed out what i could read from where' i sat at the dining table, to which he explained these were "thoughts from 4am this morning". the children were in [mr farrington]'s care at the time of the home visit. another example was during a meeting [in mid-2023 with [y], the child and adolescent mental health (camhs) team, cyps (being myself and [ms p]) and [mr farrington]. the meeting did not include [mr farrington] initially however once [mr farrington] joined the meeting, he begun discussing the custody proceedings and [ms belkis] directly in front of [y]. examples of comments from [mr farrington] included words to the effect of ‘[ms belkis] not being willing to assist in [y]'s mental health' and ' [ms belkis] not wanting to facilitate anything to do with [y]'s mental health". as [mr farrington] spoke openly about the proceedings [y] was observed by [ms p] to take out an ipad and open the 'notes app'. [y] proceeded to scroll through what seemed to be an extensive document, before she began typing at the bottom of the note and looking to [mr farrington] and cyps as she typed. it seemed that she was adding notes to the existing document based on the conversation around the custody proceedings. [ms p] was unable to see the exact contents of the document. alcohol use it is my view that [ms belkis]' alcohol consumption is not at a level of concern, noting the results of the hair strand tests provided to me within the context of the most recent appraisal. however, i note [x] and [y]'s apparent hyper-vigilance to [ms belkis]' alcohol intake, in addition to the allegations made regarding her consuming alcohol excessively. i agree that [ms belkis] should not drink to excess with the children in her care. mental health support for [ms belkis] i agree that [ms belkis] will need to continue to prioritise her mental health by way of regular clinical appointments. [ms belkis] has displayed her willingness to seek and utilise supports, and i assess that [ms belkis] should, and will, continue to do this. mental health support for the children it is of utmost importance, noting the emotional abuse [x] and [y] have endured in the context of the current proceedings, that their therapeutic support is a priority. while the children have been referred to [j program] through [q counsellors] and [r families], it is noted that the children's mental health, and particularly [y]'s , has deteriorated rapidly. as a result of [y]'s current mental health issues, the referral for [j program] has been paused for [y] by [r families] and [q counsellors]. this is to allow clinical care and supports to be implemented with [y] to address her mental health issues. it is critical that [ms belkis] ensure that [y] receives all recommended clinical care and support child and adolescent mental health service (camhs), and any associated referred services by camhs. there has been a delay in [ms belkis] beginning [s program] a pre-cursor to the children beginning [j program]. it is critical that [ms belkis] prioritises this, so that both children can begin [j program] as soon as is recommended. i am informed by [q counsellors] and [r families] that additional therapeutic supports are not recommended concurrently to [j program]. care and protection’s views and recommendations as a delegate of the director general, i support [ms belkis]' application. my assessment, however, is that in the future when recommended by the children's therapeutic supports (and presumably when [mr farrington] develops insight into the impact of his behaviours and conversations on the children's emotional wellbeing) that time with the children and [mr farrington] should occur to as to rebuild a safe relationship with the children. i do not believe it is in the children's best interest to resume week about arrangements and instead believe that it is in the children's best interests to live with [ms belkis] on a full time basis. i recommend the family continue to engage with cyps by way of a family preservation period to assist in the transition of [x] and [y] to their mother's care. cyps will assist in connecting therapeutic supports to the children and [ms belkis]. from here i recommend that [y] will continue engagement with camhs (and any referrals offered by camhs), until she is able to have her referral to [j program] resumed. [x] will begin [j program] as guided by [q counsellors] and [r families] with the assistance of [ms belkis]. any suggested services at the conclusion of [j program] are to be considered and followed up by [ms belkis]. if no further referrals are made by [q counsellors] and [r families], i recommend therapeutic support for each child be sought by [ms belkis]. i recommend that [ms belkis] complete the youth mental health first aid course and the domestic violence education program alongside any other programs that can assist her in caring for her children during this period of conflict and litigation. i recommend that [mr farrington] engages meaningfully in the [l] program he has been referred to and anticipates beginning in september 2023. the program is aimed at educating people around family violence and focusing on lasting change, while stressing accountability and responsibility. i acknowledge [mr farrington]'s completion of the youth mental health first aid course. i also acknowledge his engagement in [s program] and [t program] with [q counsellors] and [r families] so far.
