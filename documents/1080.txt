introduction
background
the evidence
the issues in this case
should the court make an order for equal shared or sole parental responsibility?  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
note: the presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61b. it does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65daa).   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or   family violence.
it appears the risk of family violence is significantly reduced when there are ivo’s in place and when the parents have limited contact with one another, however this level of intervention prevents the parties from resolving their difficulties or working towards a functioning co-parenting relationship.   the order is taken to require each of those persons: (a) to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and   to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and   to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.
they are both supportive of the children engaging in further assessment to provide clarity on the level of support the children need which suggests there may be opportunities for them to jointly advocate for the children.   gaynor] became defensive during discussions regarding the co-parenting relationship and was reluctant to consider alternative methods of engaging ms [danbridge] constructively with regard to the children’s needs.
what are the legal principles the court applies in determining where a child should live?
a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.
how does the court determine what is in the children’s best interests?
do the parties’ proposals provide for a meaningful relationship between the children and each of their parents?
are the younger children at risk of harm in the father’s care?
the 67z response report dated 5 october 2022 noted 14 previous reports had been made to child protection between 2006 and 2022 alleging concerns pertaining to exposure to family violence, alleged parental substance use and criminal activity, allegations of sexual abuse of [z] by ms [danbridge]’s ex-partner [mr g] and previous allegations of physical discipline of [mr c]. (as per the original)
“[the father] doesn’t have a problem with marijuana, it makes him communicate more and he isn’t angry”. her only concern is if [mr gaynor] were to “relapse” [on [drugs] and the impact this would have on his capacity to care for the children.
what are the views of y and z?
what is the relationship of y and z like with each parent and with x?   was united with her siblings in the playroom and this was a warm reunion and the siblings appeared to have a positive relationship with each other, with [x] sharing her time between the siblings as well as engaging in independent activities throughout the day.
does each parent have the capacity to meet the children’s needs?
how would a shared care arrangement impact on the children?   has some particular developmental needs which may support a primary home, however with the sharing of information and some careful planning, [y] may not be overly impacted by a shared care arrangement. he appears to derive positives from both homes, and restricting time in either home may limit his ability to gain the benefits each parent can offer him.
what are the orders that are in the children’s best interests?
should the court find that there are no risks in association with [mr gaynor]’s drug use and if there are no current concerns for family violence present, the court may consider implementing the previous shared care parenting arrangements for [y] and [z], with consideration for the parents to engage in the following: parenting orders program, family therapy, consideration for this report to be released to professionals supporting the family.
normally an inability to communicate would contraindicate the viability of a shared care arrangement, however there [are] a few factors which may suggest there are benefits to implementing a 50 / 50 care arrangement for this family. there are some parenting limitations associated with each parent which suggests they may both benefit from some respite from the rigours of full time parenting. this includes both parents capacity to adequately respond to the children’s needs respond to them appropriately and a shared care arrangement may alleviate some of the pressures of full time parenting.
bringing the siblings together should be prioritised and maintaining the sibling relationship is likely to be more successful in a shared care arrangement with the younger children likely to see [x] more frequently. limiting the time the younger children spend with [mr gaynor] could inadvertently result in limiting their time with [x] thereby negatively impacting the sibling relationship.
both parents clearly love and care for their children and it is apparent that this and their parenting skills and approaches have similarities which has ensured the children have experienced positive parenting across both homes. the children derive different perspectives and world views from each of the parents and this appears to be advantageous to them rather than detrimental. it may be more unfavourable if their time with either parent was limited and the children would benefit from spending substantial time with both parents. notwithstanding the risk issues that have been canvassed in both homes, the warm bond the children appear to have with each parent suggests that this hasn’t impaired their capacity to maintain a positive relationship with each of them.
