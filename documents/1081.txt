reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction hat is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents’ proposals embraced in competing applications involve again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children’s best interests.[2]
background
in my view, this is a difficult and complex case. i accept that there are significant elements of unilaterally in [ms rowan]’s behaviour. in this context, i must be careful not to easily condone actions which, in public policy terms, may have implications for other parents, who are considering moving a child or children far away from another parent. i know from my own experience, as a judge of this court, that relocation cases, particularly unilateral relocation cases, precipitate very powerful and sometimes bitter emotions from the parents concerned. the various outcomes available cannot be twisted to provide an outcome acceptable to all concerned. as such, it is preferable that these issues be decided on a level playing field, before any move takes place. [ms rowan] did not have [mr hopkins]’ approval to move to [town b]. it was unlikely that such approval would have ever been easily provided. however, [x] and [y]’s best interests remain the paramount consideration for the court. as such, it is not my function to punish [ms rowan] for her unilateral action, particularly if this will have some deleterious consequences for the children concerned. in my view, the evidence does indicate that [ms rowan] was presented with a significant accommodation emergency. she did the best she could to respond to that emergency, in a child-focussed manner, which contained some reference to the children’s need to retain a meaningful level of relationship with their father. as such, i am satisfied that the relocation was one which can be considered and contained in its implications and one which falls within the closely confined parameters envisaged by justice boland in morgan & miles. i do not consider that it would be in the children’s best interests if the mother is compelled to return to adelaide given the obvious potential for uncertainly and disruption which surrounds such an option. in addition, in all the circumstances of this case, including the as yet unproven issues relating to family violence, but the obvious fact that the mother has been the children’s undisputed primary carer up to this stage, i do not consider that it would be in [x] and [y]’s best interest to move into their father’s care. this leaves the option of the maintenance of the current status quo, which i consider the best option for the children at this stage.[3]   rowan]’s allegations about [mr hopkins]’ coercive controlling abuse towards her, during the parties’ relationship and following their separation, are matters of evidence for the honourable court. in the report writer’s opinion, additional factors that add credibility to [ms rowan]’s allegations is the level of detail and context to her allegations. for instance, she was able to describe how [mr hopkins] allegedly harassed and digitally stalked her following the parties’ separation, how he psychologically abused her during the parties’ relationship which included denigrating her in the children’s presence and the presence of others, blamed her for his behaviours such a accessing online dating sites, and minimised his behaviours by referring to them as a joke. in the report writer’s opinion, these factors add credibility to the [ms rowan]’s responses. in addition, [ms rowan] was able to recall timeframes of when [mr hopkins] had damaged property and when he was physically abusive or threatening towards her, the approximate frequency of the alleged physical abuse (including threatening behaviour) and that it reportedly emerged towards the end of the parties’ relationship. in the report writer’s opinion, these factors add credibility to [ms rowan]’s responses. [ms rowan]’s responses indicated that the cumulative impact of [mr hopkins]’ alleged continuous psychological abuse, gradually eroded her self-esteem and self-worth. this appeared characteristic of someone who had been involved in an abusive relationship. within a coercive controlling abusive relationship, there is a distinct power imbalance, whereby the perpetrator of violence/abuse holds the majority of the power. the power imbalance is asserted via abusive forms such as physical, verbal, sexual, financial, social and psychological abuse. [ms rowan]’s allegations suggested that [mr hopkins]’ abuse towards her, when the parties were in a relationship, was executed in a variety of forms.[4]   and [y]’s responses suggested [mr hopkins]’ continued propensity to make inappropriate comments that created for the children, emotional discomfort and particularly for [x], appeared to trigger for him an inappropriate sense of responsibility for [mr hopkins], anxiety, guilt and a likely sense of divided loyalties between the parties. this supported [ms rowan]’s concerns about [mr hopkins]’ preoccupation with his own needs which at times inhibited his ability or willingness to consider the children’s emotional needs.[5]
when considering what would ultimately likely be in the children’s best interests, it is the report writer’s opinion that ideally, [ms rowan] and the children returning to live in metropolitan adelaide, would be the optimal option. this is with respect to the children’s development in terms of having the benefit of relatively equal parental input and opportunity to develop equally significant attachment relationships with their parents. this often creates the best possible foundation for the children’s healthy psychological, emotional and social development. [mr hopkins] suggested that he and [ms rowan] relocate to the wider metropolitan adelaide suburb of [suburb v], given the possibility of increased affordable rental properties. in the event of the honourable court, considering [ms rowan] and the children returning to live in metropolitan adelaide to be in the children’s best interests, it is recommended that both parties relocate to a suburb or surrounding suburbs in wider metropolitan adelaide, mutually agreed upon between the parties, within the next six months, ideally prior to the commencement of the 2023 academic school year. it is recommended that once both parties’ have relocated to a mutually agreed upon area in wider metropolitan adelaide, that could facilitate a shared care arrangement, the children’s overnight time with [mr hopkins] commence from three consecutive overnight periods in each alternate weekend and increase incrementally over a twelve- month period, until such time that the children are spending seven consecutive overnight periods with [mr hopkins] in each alternate week. in the report writer’s opinion, given that the children will be required to adjust to further change in their living arrangements, graduating towards an equal shared care arrangement considers their need for time, to adjust to change.[6]
in the event of the honourable court considering [ms rowan] and the children’s return to metropolitan adelaide to be unrealistic with the implications of the return proving too logistically challenging for [ms rowan] which in turn could negatively impact her parenting capacity and the children, it is recommended that [ms rowan] and the children remain living in [town b], [region c] and the children spend time with [mr hopkins] on each alternate weekend, from friday until sunday and 60% of the all school holiday periods.[7]   if, in proceedings under this act: (a) a party (the examining party) intends to cross‑examine another party (the witness party), and (b) there is an allegation of family violence between the examining party and the witness party, and (c) any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   a party (the examining party) intends to cross‑examine another party (the witness party), and (b) there is an allegation of family violence between the examining party and the witness party, and (c) any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   there is an allegation of family violence between the examining party and the witness party, and (c) any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,  ) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,  i) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,  ) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,
then the requirements of subsection (2) apply to the cross-examination.
one of the central features of family violence ... is that it invariably occurs between people who share a domestic relationship and, as a consequence, it occurs behind closed doors and is not subject to obvious scrutiny by outside sources. in addition, its victims and indeed its protagonists are ashamed, embarrassed or fearful to tell others about it. so it is not necessarily the case that there will be police charges or that a person will seek out an injunction from the police or from the court to protect him or her, but issues of family violence remain significant in the case concerned.

the essential elements of the definition are that the behaviour in question, to amount to family violence must coerce or control another family member.  aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[12]
whilst parental responsibility is vaguely defined, some insight into what is needed from a parent can be seen in s 65dac(3) which provides that if both parents have that responsibility, they are taken to be required to consult about parenting issues and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision. it will again be remembered that the focus of the objects and principles in this act is on joint parenting.[19]  s a broad concept as described in s 61b and that task covers many things. parents are expected jointly to endeavour to promote their children’s development by ensuring they have the greatest potential in adulthood whilst at the same time enjoying the security of childhood they deserve.[20]
discussion  wholly surmised his views of the central issues related to this matter when he stated that he wished to remain living in the [region c] where his friends and family lived and he wished to increase his time with [mr hopkins]. he acknowledged that satisfying both of the said needs/wishes was likely not possible.[21]
conclusions
...[w]hat the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
