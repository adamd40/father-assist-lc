applicable legal principles
“the principles which in my view should apply in such cases are that the court should have regard to any earlier order and to the reasons for and the material on which that order was based. it should not lightly entertain an application to reverse an earlier custody order. to do so would invite endless litigation for change in an ever present factor in human affairs. therefore, the court would need to be satisfied by the applicant that there was some changed circumstance which would justify such a serious step, some new factor arising, or, at any rate, some new factor which was not disclosed at the previous hearing which would have been material.”  ] in a case where the principle in rice & asplund arises for consideration, there are two circumstances which are central to the decision. first, there will already exist a parenting order and, axiomatically, the terms of that order will reflect the best interests of the child/ren at the time of its making. second, the fact that an order has been made reflects that disputation between parties to a parenting dispute, such dispute being inherently contrary to the best interests of the child/ren whilst it exists, has been brought to an end by a curial order. those twin circumstances dictate the conclusion that it cannot logically be in the best interests of the child/ren to embark upon further litigation enquiring as to the child/ren’s best interests unless it is first demonstrated that a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred since the parenting order was made.  ] the determination of whether there has been sufficient change in circumstances to warrant a re-opening of parenting issues can be determined as a preliminary issue or be considered at the same time as the hearing into that re-opening. the full court in marsden & winch continued and at [58] formulated the inquiry to first establish a prima facie case of changed circumstances to have been established, and secondly a consideration as to whether that case is a sufficient change of circumstances to justify embarking on a hearing.  ] there are two matters of public policy that support the application of the threshold question even at the end of a hearing. namely, that it is important for one judge not simply to substitute his or her conclusion for another judge, unless there has been a change of circumstance sufficient to justify that course. secondly, albeit the particular litigation has run, if no such rule is even considered, in a general sense litigation will not be discouraged. [74] in summary: if applied as a preliminary matter it may achieve all its purposes, and the rule in rice and asplund is generally expressed – as a rule to be applied as a preliminary matter, if applied at the end of a full hearing of parenting issues, the rule cannot achieve all its ends, but can achieve some and ought still receive consideration. however, its force may be diminished.
