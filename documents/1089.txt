parenting contributions
wife’s health and employment  per the original)  e wife] gave an account of her adult life as involving repeated traumatic events. this included the divorce from her first husband ([mr mm]) who is the father of her three children when he returned to [country nn] due to difficulties assimilating in australia, the sudden death of her second husband ([mr oo]) when [the wife] was 32 years of age (in 1997), the subsequent loss of her baby following [mr oo’s] death as the baby’s father, the death of her own father soon after and a serious work accident that occurred in 2011 where [the wife suffered severe injuries] and was supported by a workers comp claim from approximately 2011 to 2016. of these five traumatic events, [the wife] attributed the most psychological trauma (prior to 2013) to losing [mr oo], due to the compounding issues of becoming a single parent (once again), missing her loving husband whom she was deeply connected to, needing to move house and suppo1ting her young family at the time to understand and adjust to the loss. [the wife] saw a psychologist at this time ([ms pp]) who treated her for grief. it is unclear if any formal diagnostic assessments were conducted at that time to confirm mental health diagnoses, however [the wife] described that she was left with flashbacks of the traumatic incident. [the wife] provided emergency ‘[assistance]’to [mr oo] until paramedics arrived. he was later declared deceased. following the death of her husband, the workplace accident also had a profound impact on [the wife] in terms of her chronic pain and associated difficulties. a two year delay in approval for surgery with workers compensation meant her [body] was not working and she was limping around with a high degree of pain. [the wife] returned to work in 2011 on night duties however reported she was still ‘vulnerable’ with ‘low self esteem’ when she started a relationship with [the husband] in 2013. [the wife] reported being adequately financially compensated for this accident and felt this is what attracted [the husband] to her. [the wife] reported ‘he said all the right things’ in the first few months of their relationship. [the wife] advised loneliness as the reason she began dating [the husband]. [the wife] advised she knew of [the husband] as he [knew] an old friend [...]. [the wife] advised she was raised in a good christian family with two loving parents who ‘did not raise their voices’, even when her or her siblings needed disciplining. [the wife] referred to her parents as exemplary models for how to parent, and she chose to raise her children replicating their family values of love and fostering calm. hard work was a second strong family value and many of [the wife’s] immediate and extended family held prestigious jobs. [the wife] described a close and loving relationship with her children, their children ([the wife’s] grandchildren) and her mother who lived nearby. family was a strong value for [the wife] which appeared to be a maintaining factor for [the wife] to remain with [the husband], according to self-report. she saw herself as a carer to [c], [the husband’s] daughter, who was a toddler when they got together, and almost saw it her ‘duty’ to protect her from [the husband’s] alleged aggression. [the wife] reported feeling guilt at leaving her and worried for her future when in the care of [the husband]. whilst [c] was not primarily residing with [the husband] and [the wife] during the course of their relationship, she was there often, almost for half the time, due to her mother being sick. a shared custody arrangement was in place with the mother.
given [the wife’s] level of psychological distress and expressed need for ·talking therapy·, assessment was never a focus of treatment. rather, [the wife] received treatment to reduce her level of symptomatology and help her stabilise. despite a full diagnostic assessment not being completed, using a combination of dsm-5 criteria and the ptsd checklist for dsm-5, [the wife] meets dsm-5 diagnostic criteria for a provisional diagnosis of ptsd. this diagnosis is provisional as the ptsd checklist is a quicker screening tool than more rigorous measures and was therefore sufficient for the purposes of providing some baseline data for ptsd treatment. it is to be noted that [the wife] could have previously had ptsd which would make the cumulative effects more pronounced. evidence based treatment for ptsd called cognitive processing therapy was attempted in 2021 once [the wife] seemed more stable in her own residence. cognitive processing therapy is a type of trauma focused cognitive behavioural therapy (cbt) that teaches someone how to reframe negative thoughts about the trauma by talking about the thoughts, writing assignments and completing worksheets in between sessions. [the wife] was keen to start this type of treatment and was highly engaged in learning yet the focus soon returned to her fears of the impending court attendance which seemed to be its own trauma trigger. in my opinion, [the wife] was evidenced to need to talk (rather than listen and take on new strategies for change) at this time. in addition, [the wife] had significant time limitations and reported exhaustion after full-time work so the completion of ‘homework’ would have proven difficult. the optimal time to resume this trauma-focused work is once [the wife] feels more regulated and less overwhelmed which is expected to be more likely once cou1t proceedings have concluded.
...[the wife’s] work has been significantly impacted by her alleged trauma. the reported sick days due to exhaustion, the use of recreational leave for court attendances, the guilt at not completing her work to a satisfactory standard due the complications in her life were all likely evidence of this. furthermore, [the wife] expressed her decision to work full-time was based on necessity, not choice, which is likely to have further exacerbated her anxiety by her feeling stuck (or ‘trapped’) and overwhelmed. burnout is an identified risk, particularly given [the wife] is a 58 year old with health complications, with her age providing another barrier to continuing her current work demands. it is my view that a thorough work capacity assessment is indicated due to these complexities.
a note on alternatives to treatment throughout treatment [ the wife] was constantly offered alternate treatment options to more thoroughly meet her complex needs. this included discussions of alternate psychologists to provide more intensive, regular out of hours sessions (to allow for [the wife’s] full-time work schedule), to seek treatment/possible diagnoses from a forensic psychologist and to seek treatment/possible diagnoses from a psychiatrist. [the wife] declined all these options citing she was in treatment to talk and process her trauma and wanted sessions to continue as is. also, [the wife] noted her medical issues, time/ leave constraints and financial pressure all prevented treatment from a psychiatrist which could have included medication to enhance [the wife’s] coping capacities, particularly with ongoing unavoidable triggers such as court proceedings. recommendations that [the wife] continue with psychological treatment with a view to resuming cognitive processing therapy, following the conclusion of court proceedings. that these sessions be out of work hours, where possible. that consideration is given for a comprehensive ptsd diagnosis including assessment for moral injury, if this is deemed helpful and important for [the wife]. that medical follow up occur including consideration for pain management treatment for [the wife’s] medical and pain related issues including treatment for muscle tightness. that a workplace assessment be considered to assess [the wife’s] risk of burnout, impact of injuries and impact of ptsd on her capacity to work into the future.
husband’s health and employment
i have been given permission by the patient to reveal to whom it may concern that i have been as patient for the past 21 years with the following conditions [...] stress, anxiety, reactive depression –due to marital conflicts at the present moment. this is of particular concern ,because it is possibly having a direct detrimental effect on all the other systems and this can’t be controlled in the usual manner with medications. all these are causing him and myself great concern about his future health. these all need to be addressed as quickly as possible so that he can get on with his life in a car and productive manner. (as per the original)
the law  in property settlement proceedings after the breakdown of a de facto relationship, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate: (a) in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them--altering the interests of the parties to the de facto relationship in the property, or   in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them--altering the interests of the parties to the de facto relationship in the property, or
[...]   if a party to the de facto relationship dies after the breakdown of the de facto relationship, an order made under subsection (1) in property settlement proceedings may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party. (3) the court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. (4) in considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court must take into account:   the court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. (4) in considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court must take into account:   in considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court must take into account:   the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship: (i) to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property,   to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property,  ) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property,
whether or not that last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, and (b) the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship: (i) to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property, whether or not that last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, and (c) the contribution made by a party to the de facto relationship to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the de facto relationship and any children of the de facto relationship, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent, and (d) the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the de facto relationship, and (e) the matters referred to in subsection 90sf(3) so far as they are relevant, and [...]  the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship: (i) to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property,   the contribution made by a party to the de facto relationship to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the de facto relationship and any children of the de facto relationship, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent, and (d) the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the de facto relationship, and (e) the matters referred to in subsection 90sf(3) so far as they are relevant, and   the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the de facto relationship, and (e) the matters referred to in subsection 90sf(3) so far as they are relevant, and   the matters referred to in subsection 90sf(3) so far as they are relevant, and
...the nature of the s 79 inquiry is, in essence, a broad discretionary assessment, which is neither an accounting nor mathematical exercise and which, effectively as a corollary, requires a “broad-brush approach”.
if the point is that, where there is a short marriage, where there are no children and where the parties’ contributions to their assets and to the welfare of the family from the commencement of the relationship to the time of the hearing is equal, any disparity in initial financial contributions is of critical importance in determining the overall contributions of the parties, then such a position is easily arrived at by the application of principle alone.
in our opinion it is not so much a matter of erosion of contribution but a question of what weight is to be attached, in all the circumstances, to the initial contribution. it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. in the present case that use was a substantial contribution to the purchase price of the matrimonial home: see also campo and campo (unreported, full court (ellis, lindenmayer and finn jj), sydney, delivered 19 may 1995 at pages 21 and 22 of the joint judgment) and zahra and zahra (unreported, full court sydney, delivered 3 october 1996, per ellis j. at page 10).
“one pool” or “two pool” approach
...if the parties’ interests in specific items of property differ or they have made differing contributions, it may be desirable to proceed upon an item by item basis in the division of property between them. in such cases, justice and equity may be best served by treating the items separately for the purpose of determining the proportions in which they are to be divided, particularly if the overall division is to be effected by the transfer or retention of interests in individual assets...   firstly, the “remainder pool” would include the city bb property which was acquired by the wife using capital from her workers’ compensation payment relating to an injury sustained in 2011 and to which the husband made no contribution, and (b) the husband consented to an order for the wife to receive by way of interim distribution of $100,000 from the sale proceeds of y street, which he purchased using funds from his mother’s estate.   the husband consented to an order for the wife to receive by way of interim distribution of $100,000 from the sale proceeds of y street, which he purchased using funds from his mother’s estate.
commencement of the de facto relationship
legal framework  a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if:   the persons are not legally married to each other,
[...] (c) having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.   having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.   those circumstances may include any or all of the following   the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.   the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them,   whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship,   no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. (4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case.   a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case.  .] the presence of a mutually recognised de facto or marital relationship involving a shared life was critical in each of szoxp, crabtree and stanford. in stanford, the continued subsistence of such a relationship explained the making of the “necessary or desirable adjustments” to the property interests of the husband and wife. in contrast, where the “necessary or desirable adjustments” are not made, and one party fundamentally acts contrary to the interests of the other in relation to the property of the couple, it may be possible to conclude that the mutual commitment to a shared life has ceased. the language of s 4aa of the act and its reference to “living together” requires no different approach to determining whether a relationship exists of the kind defined. “living together”, consistently with authority, should be construed as meaning sharing life as a couple. section 4aa does not prescribe any way by which a couple may share life together. its language is sufficiently broad to accommodate the great variety of ways a de facto relationship may exist. that conclusion is supported by the varied factors listed in s 4aa(2). in a given case, some of the factors listed in s 4aa(2) may be relevant and some may be irrelevant, inevitably some may have greater prominence than others. a conclusion that a de facto relationship has ended may also arise because of factors not listed in s 4aa(2). such a conclusion is mandated by s 4aa(3) and (4). in particular, s 4aa(4) is a statutory recognition that what may constitute a genuine de facto relationship is not be determined in the same way in every case by reference to rigid criteria that must always be satisfied. in that respect, the language of s 4aa(2)(b) does not assume that every de facto relationship must have a “common residence” to some “extent” and of some “nature”. such a construction is entirely denied by s 4aa(3). [...] whilst there had been a degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, that commitment ceased when the respondent refused to make the “necessary or desirable adjustments” in support of the appellant and, by his conduct, acted contrary to her needs. it may otherwise be accepted that the breakdown of the respondent’s relationship with the appellant’s children is not, in the circumstances of this case, a decisive consideration. in contrast, the “public aspects” of the relationship are important. this is a case where the respondent’s conduct in threatening the interests of the appellant justified the intervention of ncat and the appointment of the trustee to take responsibility for her. thereafter, it has been the trustee, and the not the respondent, that has made, and is trying to make, the “necessary or desirable adjustments”.

that is, these principles, which should only apply to exceptional cases, may become common coinage in property cases and be used inappropriately as tactical weapons or for personal attacks and so return this court to fault and misconduct in property matters – a circumstance which proved so debilitating in the past. in addition there is the risk of substantial additional time and cost. ... it is essential to bear in mind the relatively narrow band of cases to which these considerations apply. to be relevant, it would be necessary to show that the conduct occurred during the course of the marriage and had discernible impact upon the contributions of the other party. it is not directed to conduct which does not have that effect... it has to be said, that their honours terms “exceptional” and “narrow” lose much of their force if cases involving significant violence are to be the subject of the application of the principles. such cases might have been regarded as exceptional at the time kennon was decided but they cannot today be so regarded. unfortunately the prevalence of family violence is wide and artificial barriers to its recognition, such as trying to limit its recognition in property cases to exceptional or narrow cases, has no basis in principle. as i shall endeavour to explain shortly, the focus of the majority’s reasoning was on the nature and quality of the contributions themselves which were not limited by such qualifying adjectives.
23. in kennon, the principle was identified as follows:
put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79. for the reasons given, the words “significantly” and “more arduous” are not to be read as coterminous with “exceptional”. rather, they arise from the basis of the principle itself which focuses on contributions. if the nature and extent of a person’s contributions are made more difficult or harder so that they should be accorded greater weight, such that they should be taken into account in the determining of the outcome, they have therefore been “significantly impacted” or made “more arduous”. the focus is not on the conduct per se, but on its effects on contributions. the threshold for recognition is therefore met by conduct which has a discernible effect on the contributions of the other party such that it should be recognised in determining the respective contributions of the parties. that, in my view, should be the focus and terms such as “exceptional” or “narrow”, or indeed, “onerous” add an unnecessary and unacceptable gloss suggesting that a rare and high level of impact is required and that the violence or its impact must be exceptional. that is not however, what their honours said. all that was required was a “significant adverse impact” upon a party’s contributions. the word “significant” was used, in my opinion, as describing that the effect must be sufficient to warrant recognition but not imparting some artificial threshold. the effect of the conduct must be such that a greater weight should be given to the contributions. more recent cases have softened some of the harshness of the original application of the principles identified in kennon. for example, it is now the position that the adverse effect of the violence on the contributions of a party can be inferred from the lay evidence of the parties and that there is no need to call evidence to “quantify” that effect (maine & maine [2016] famcafc 270, (2016) 56 fam lr 500 at [47]–[52] (“maine”), britt & britt [2017] famcafc 27, (2017) flc 93-764 at [74]–[75], keating & keating [2019] famcafc 46, (2019) flc 93-894 at [27]–[43], [52]–[67], benson & drury [2020] famcafc 303, (2020) flc 93-998 (“benson & drury”) at [47]–[50]). it seems to me that regarding kennon claims as “special” or “exceptional” is apt to mislead. in reality, all the majority said in that case was that a person’s contributions are to be assessed in the light of all of the circumstances and where those circumstances have the effect of making the contributions more difficult, onerous or arduous, that should be recognised in the assessment of contributions. that, of course, takes place in a holistic manner (dickons v dickons (2012) 50 fam lr 244, jabour & jabour [2019] famcafc 78, (2019) flc 93-898). the primary judge did not use those words. rather, her honour said “the wife’s non-financial contributions were impacted and made more difficult and distressing” (at [46]) and “more arduous” (at [126]). they were found to be of such a nature so as to require consideration. i would not take that to be an incorrect application of the principles set out in kennon. the difficulty that arises in this matter is, however, that the primary judge did not explain how the acts of violence of the husband led to the non-financial contributions of the wife being made difficult, distressing and more arduous. the reasons are silent on the issue. in maine, the court held that the application of the principle in kennon “required of his honour findings in respect of evidence that addressed specifically... the impact that the violence had upon the wife’s contributions” (at [52]). the requisite finding could, as discussed, be inferred as explained in benson & drury at [50]. the husband submits that the absence of this discussion indicates that her honour did not understand and did not correctly apply the principles set out in kennon (ground 2(a)). alternatively, it is said that the failure itself is an error (ground 1(c), ground 2(b) and ground 3). i incline to the latter view, but either way, error has been demonstrated. whilst the events described by the wife were no doubt distressing, the evidence and the findings did not deal with the magnitude and extent of its effect. whilst matters can certainly be inferred, that inference must be properly based on the evidence before the court.
here, the primary judge found the appellant perpetrated family violence upon the respondent and drew an inference that such violence did have an effect upon the respondent’s contributions, making them “all the more arduous” (at [162]). an inference is an assent to the existence of a fact which is based on the proven existence of some other fact or facts, drawn as part of the fact finding process as an exercise of ordinary powers of deduction and reason in the light of human experience, unaffected by any rule of law (g v h [1994] hca 48, (1994) 181 clr 387 at [4]). obviously, the strength of the subject inference depends upon the quality of the underlying evidence. it must be reasonable to draw the inference from primary facts. mere conjecture will not suffice (seltsam pty ltd v mcguiness (2000) 49 nswlr 262 at 275–278 per spigelman cj, carr v baker [1936] nswstrp 20, (1936) 36 sr (nsw) 301 at 306–307 per jordan cj). importantly, the evaluation of the evidence from which the subject inference is sought to be drawn should be thorough and balanced. in the context of a kennon argument, any factual controversies over the alleged misconduct of one spouse and its alleged deleterious consequential effects upon the other spouse should be resolved by familiar forensic techniques. disputed but untested allegations, are not facts (keating at [55]–[66]).
