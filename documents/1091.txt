credit and reliability of the parties’ evidence ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... (citations omitted)  ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (“carlson”) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case:  5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... [169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide.  ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.

first proceedings in this court
first independent observations and mr pieters’ first court-ordered time
... [ms westmore] said the most serious incident was when [mr pieters] threatened her and [x] with what she believed at the time to be a real gun (since confirmed as being a gun that fires blanks). [ms westmore] alleges [mr pieters] threatened that if she ever left him she would never see [x] again. ... [mr pieters] alleged the mother has on a number of occasions threatened to kill herself and to kill the children if she was not able to continue to have them in her care. ... ...on two occasions the mother has withheld time for [x] with the father for extended periods of time, between [late] 2015 and from january" to present date, 22 july 2016. prior to these periods of not seeing her father [x] was in the sole care of her father for a period while [ms westmore] was incarcerated. [mr pieters] continued to facilitate time for [x] with her mother throughout her incarceration, taking [x] to contact visits at the prison usually on a fortnightly basis. this required him to drive four hours each way and stay overnight with friends to enable this to take place. in this regard it is evident [mr pieters] is willing to support [x]’s relationship with her mother. ... ... [x] was asked if daddy’s name was [mr pieters] or [mr gg] and she confirmed his name was [mr pieters]. [x] said she does not remember daddy [mr pieters]. if it is accurate that [x] is being encouraged to believe [mr pieters] is not her father this is of very serious concern. notable in undertaking an observation of [x] with her father was that in marked contrast on seeing any other adults into the room, when she would typically have a nervous response, she immediately approached him with her arms held out. the look on [x]’s face could perhaps be described as incredulous as she clearly wish to go to [mr pieters] but appeared perplexed that he was in the room. [x] walked slowly towards [mr pieters] and went straight into his arms to be hugged. there was physical affection demonstrated at various points during the observation and [x] displayed no anxiety or fear whatsoever with her father. [x] and her father played happily and appropriately together... [emphasis added]

[ms westmore] has twice been convicted [of offences]. whilst i did not obtain specific details of the crime, she presented as ashamed... [ms westmore] didn’t present as mentally ill in this assessment. her offending history suggests she has character flaws possibly consistent with personality psychopathology. whether these character flaws interfere with her parenting capacity is unclear, but it does represent an area of concern. ... whilst there remain concerns regarding [ms westmore]'s developmental history and related criminal history, and therefore personality traits, she presented as mentally well and stable in this assessment with no overt signs signalling concern. ...

28 february 2017 interviews, ms f’s first family report dated 23 march 2017
... in interview [ms westmore] was entirely positive about [x]’s relationship with her father: describing it as ‘good’. as previously mentioned, she considers [x] ‘enjoys’ spending time with her father. that being the case [ms westmore] was asked to explain why there had been 2 long intervals when [x] did not spend time with her father, from [late] 2015, and subsequently, from january 2016 to 22 july 2016, when the matter came before the federal circuit court. [ms westmore], in response, about the 6-month interval in 2015, reiterated her views at paragraph 73 (a) and (b) of her affidavit, filed 27 february 2017. essentially, she stopped [x] seeing her father in 2015 because of safety concerns after she had obtained the intervention order against [mr pieters] in early 2015. it must be said, however, that it was more difficult for [ms westmore] to justify the second cessation of contact in 2016. referring to this period, in the same affidavit [ms westmore] states that in ‘hindsight’ the situation was ‘regrettable’. in interview [ms westmore] acknowledged, ‘...it was very bad’ to deny [x] time with her father’. [ms westmore] did not seek professional advice at the time, such as advice about the possible damaging impact on [x] of not spending time with her father. ... as she did with [dr p], [ms westmore] recalled her own difficulties during her childhood. she was asked by the psychologist if she had made “suicide/homicide threats”, as reported to [dr p] by [mr pieters], and discussed at paragraph 9 in [dr p’s] opinion and recommendations. [ms westmore] denied she had made any such threats. ... [ms westmore] recognises the profound impact of this emotional abuse on herself. it is for this reason, she said, she will never talk badly to [x] or [ms w] about their respective fathers... ... speaking about her criminal charges, [ms westmore] recalled she had got on very well with her employers. however she then stole from them. it seems, from her account, [ms westmore] has no real understanding about the reasons for her offending behaviour. notably, while speaking about the offences and the impact of her behaviour on herself and her family, [ms westmore] indicated, on the psychologist’s suggestion, her interest in obtaining psychiatric assistance. she sought referrals from the psychologist. turning to the dispute about future care arrangements for [x], [ms westmore]’s understanding is that [mr pieters] wants [x] to live primarily with him. she seemed shocked about his position: saying, ‘no matter how many miles we’ve gained’, reiterating that the handovers are cordial, and not bad as [mr pieters] asserts, he still wants [x] to live with him. ... and, although she has, in fact, denied [x] time with [mr pieters] for two 6‑month periods, [ms westmore] now proposes a 4, then a 5-night routine, for [x] with her father. this is a significant departure from the proposals in her response of 19 may 2016, namely, of 2 hours once a month supervised at a contact centre. ... in summary it seems [ms westmore] has learnt to survive from an early age, since the time of her parents’ separation. while there may be some aspects of manipulation to her character, nonetheless her childhood traumas have impacted on her emotionally and psychologically, to the extent that she has made some life choices that have basically rebounded on her. so that ultimately she finds herself in circumstances where she is punished, in effect, setting herself up to be punished. while [ms westmore] presents with a somewhat tough, albeit self- protective exterior, she has an underlying emotional fragility. at various times in her life she has possibly felt under siege, frightened, threatened, with feelings of low self-esteem and low self-worth: all entirely explicable, given her account of her childhood and youth. it seems that, emotionally, she seeks approval.. in terms of her role as a parent, there is no indication that she would deliberately place [x] at risk. [ms westmore] is devoted to the child’s care, speaks of a close relationship between [x] and her older daughter, [ms w], and there is no reason to disbelieve her account. indeed, the two half-sisters’ strong relationship was confirmed by 3 year old [x] herself. and, despite [ms w]’s difficult history and current circumstances, [ms westmore] remains supportive of her older daughter. there are intense emotional and psychological issues for [ms westmore] to address - with professional assistance as she moves into her middle years - to ensure that she does not repeat the history and errors of her youth and early adult years as best she can, and indeed, learn from them. the psychologist has suggested to [ms westmore] that she attend upon a psychiatrist to help her understand the causes of her behaviour, to address and start with the question, “why do i place myself in this position. why do i set myself up” to be punished. ... it is apparent that [mr pieters] relies heavily on 3-year-old [x]’s accounts to him. [ms westmore], as stated above, maintains, given [x]’s young age, she is not capable of being an accurate historian... ... asked about his proposals for [x]’s time with her mother, [mr pieters] said, ‘i’ll leave that up to the court’. the psychologist put it to [mr pieters], that given his serious concerns about [ms westmore] and her household, why should [x] spend any time at all with her mother? [mr pieters], in response, considers [x] ‘absolutely’ should see [ms westmore], ‘...to keep her bond’, with her mother. ...asked how [x] might cope with reduced time with her mother, [mr pieters] replied, ‘how do you think it impacted on [x] when she was taken from me’: adding that, ‘she did it to [x]. ... [mr pieters] impressed as being singularly focused on the aberrations of the mother and does not move beyond that view. he presents as a concrete thinker, in the sense that he tends to focus on facts as he interprets them and relies on his literal definitions. he adores his young daughter, but tends to believe what [x] allegedly tells him, particularly, if it is a criticism of her mother or her household. he has, however, no actual context for what the child reports to him and no direct communication with her mother, to verify what [x] tells him. ... [ms ff], like [mr pieters], essentially believes what [x] allegedly reports to them about her mother’s household. she acknowledged they might ask [x], ‘did you see [ms w]? is [ms w] home?’ then [x] will clam-up, and say, ‘i don’t know, i can’t tell you’. [ms ff] agreed she was suggesting the child has been told by her mother not to give her father information. ... ...it was apparent that [x] has a close, familiar relationship with her mother. [ms westmore] was supportive and affectionate with [x]. ... during the play session [x] was separately interviewed by the psychologist. [x] was, however, keen to return to the playroom to play with ‘...daddy and [ms ff]. ... indeed, [x]’s comments in interview indicate she is not, and indicate expected confusion over her family constellation for a 3 year old. this is quite understandable given her young age, and the changes in her young life, with the introduction of [ms ff] and [mr gg] and his 2 children into her family constellation. in later feedback to [ms westmore] by the psychologist about [x] referring to [mr gg] as ‘daddy’, [ms westmore] was quite shocked. she reported that she emphasises to [x] the different family relationships and that [mr pieters] is her father, that ‘[mr gg] is [mr gg]’ and ‘[mr pieters] is dad’. [ms westmore] could not explain why [x] still calls [mr gg] ‘daddy’, other than [x] simply copying [mr gg’s] 2 children. ... [mr pieters] asserts that 3, nearly 4-year-old [x], is a reliable historian of events that she reports to him. [ms westmore] disagrees. ... arising from these interviews there is no information that [x] is anything but a well-cared for, well-looked after child. she is a bright, happy, chirpy, sociable little girl who appears to enjoy her family life and her kindergarten friends. [x] is developing well. she presented as exuberant and excited to spend time with all 4 adults who attended the interviews, her mother, her father, her maternal grandmother, and [ms ff]. [x] enjoyed playing with all of them, including her father, mother and [ms ff] together. notably, the child displayed no distress or hesitance in the company of her mother, her father and [ms ff]. she separated well from her mother and then from her father. [x] loves all her family, ‘nanny, mummy, [ms w], [mr gg], [ms ff], [mr pieters]. ... [ms westmore] is entirely positive about [x]’s relationship with her father, and, for that matter, with [ms ff]. ... [mr pieters] is less positive about [x]’s relationship with her mother and less inclined to support regular time for [x] with her mother. while he makes the point that [ms westmore] took [x] away from him in those 2 intervals of 6 months, his comments seem to be made more out of anger, rather than being child-focused. it is hoped that he would not deny [x] time with her mother. ... the concern is that, given [mr pieters]’ opinion of [ms westmore], it is not entirely clear that he will support [x]’s relationship with her mother, or for that matter, other members of her household, [ms westmore]'s partner, his 2 children and indeed [ms westmore]'s older daughter, [ms w]. ... in the particular circumstances of this case it is recommended that [x] continue to live with [ms westmore] and spend time with her father... [emphasis added]
the march 2017 orders
the second family report of ms f, 2 november 2017
... [ms westmore] also asserts that she certainly does not expect to be incarcerated again. but her lawyer has responded to [mr pieters] that, if this was the case, then the matter of [x]’s care might be decided at that time. in a sense [ms westmore], whether she agrees or not, is fortunate to have [mr pieters] in [x]’s life as a consistent, reliable, committed and devoted parent, upon whom she can rely. ... ...he acknowledges that, at times, [x] tells stories that might be incorrect, such as recently telling him, ‘...[ms w]’s baby had already been born’. ... mr pieters has consistently not been positive about [ms westmore]'s role as a mother. he agrees she takes care of [x] - ‘i'm not saying [ms westmore]'s a bad mother necessarily’ - but he continues to believe [x] is at risk in her mother’s care... ... asked what outcome he hopes to achieve at the final court hearing on 21 december 2017 [mr pieters] said he cannot afford legal representation. he also added that, emotionally speaking, ‘i don’t want to put myself through it, i've had enough’. his strong preference is not to return to court, but to achieve a negotiated outcome with [ms westmore] ... ... whether out of frustration and feelings of helplessness [mr pieters], at times, casts his assumptions far and wide. for example, as stated above, he implies [ms westmore] is paying for her legal representation and the family report possibly from the proceeds of crime. further, he is convinced she will return to jail. nonetheless, [mr pieters] impresses as a decent man with [x]’s best interests at heart, as a man who will undoubtedly always be available to provide support and care to his young daughter. his concerns, from his perspective, are real, based, he claims, on his experience and knowledge of [ms westmore]. although there is no information to suggest that [x] is not well cared for by her mother. simply put, [mr pieters] does not trust [ms westmore], and it is unlikely he ever will... ... the psychologist explained to [ms westmore], her sister and [x] the arrangements for the interviews. when told her father, ‘[mr pieters’], would arrive later, [x] immediately responded with, ‘he’s not my dad’. when asked by the psychologist who her father is, [x] replied, ‘[mr gg]’. [ms westmore] sighed. ... ...overall [x]’s relationship with her mother is unremarkable, in the sense that it is what one might anticipate when that parent has had the care of the child throughout their life. ... it was a very relaxed and enjoyable session between father and daughter. notably, [mr pieters] was supportive of [x] and praised her when she packed-up the playroom. when it was time to leave [x] separated readily from her father. again it was observed that [x] was neither hesitant nor distressed in the company of both parents. indeed, she was animated, happy and excited. [x]. ... given her general happy disposition, however, it was again not difficult to establish rapport with [x]. she reported to the psychologist that she had been playing ...tea parties with [mr pieters]. [x] knows [mr pieters] is her father and said she calls him ‘daddy’ at his home. the indications are, however, that [x] still calls her father ‘[mr pieters’] at her mother’s home. generally speaking, it appears [x] still identifies ‘[mr gg]’ as ‘daddy’. ... [x] also told the psychologist she does not have any toys at her father’s house. when questioned more closely by the psychologist, [x] then agreed it was ‘not true’, that in fact she does have toys at [mr pieters’] home. ... given her young age it is not that significant which titles the child uses for the people in her life. rather her misunderstanding indicates [x]’s attachment to those people. the fact that she identifies her mother’s partner at times as ‘dad’ simply reflects her position in that household where [mr gg’s] children also visit. ... from observation of [x] with both parents separately, and together, and in interview with the child, it is evident that [x] has an attachment to both parents and that they each have a bond with her. at these interviews [x] again enjoyed her time playing with both parents together, and separately. [x] identifies both parents and others as members of her family. she is a child who is developing well. ... in summary, it is evident that [mr pieters] will always be available to provide support for [x]. he is a decent man who has [x]’s best interests at the forefront of his role as a father. [ms westmore] might be mindful that [x]’s relationship with [mr pieters] is a meaningful relationship. [ms westmore] is fortunate to have [mr pieters] in [x]’s life as a consistent, reliable, committed and devoted parent, upon whom she can rely.

the 2018 litigation, mr pieters withholds x and the june 2018 bruising
ms mallett: very briefly, just so that we make sure that we don’t run across the problem later, [mr pieters], when i called for the photos, you have produced three photos. is that all of them? [mr pieters]: there were some that were identical. ms mallett: right. because – i ask because the email is entitled “some of”, so – and these photos – and anyone along the bar table, feel free to correct me at – my description. they are photos from the front only. [x] appears to be in the shower. they are taken from sort of top of the thigh-ish, or mid to top of the thigh, down showing her legs – the front of her legs in the shower? [mr pieters]: yes, that’s correct. ms mallett: and in those photos, there are a number of bruises around the knee and shin, would that be accurate? [mr pieters]: yes.
ms mallett: yes. do you contact her mum and say, “a lot of bruises. what happened”? [mr pieters]: no, i didn’t. ms mallett: why not? [mr pieters]: because [x] said, “i don’t know”. ms mallett: so because [x] doesn’t know where the bruises came from, you don’t ask her mum? [mr pieters]: no, i didn’t. ms mallett: now, you’ve mentioned a couple of times yesterday in your evidence that part of the reasoning for your approach to the mother when she sends you a covid – an indication that she and [x] are sick in 2022 – was effectively ..... well, if you knew what she was like to deal with, you would understand my response. do you agree that’s a fair summary of what you’re saying? [mr pieters]: yes.

the september 2018 interim report: clear lessons unheeded
... both parents are engaged in a level of high conflict which if left unchecked will result in a level of cumulative emotional harm for [x]. this is either a matter whereby [ms westmore] has been duplicitous in her actions whereby she has strategically sought to remove [x] from her father and have her remain in her care and is dismissive of authority and refuses to follow court orders. alternatively it is a case where [mr pieters] has used a variety of agencies to undermine [ms westmore]’s parenting and is continually reporting her behaviour to authorities.[26] ... each claim [x] wants to live with them and is somewhat dismissive of the others assertions in this regard. at interview [mr pieters] was more derogatory of [ms westmore] than she was of him. he believed her time with [x] should be supervised but could not provide an adequate reason as to why. he continued to denigrate her parenting and find fault with her. he showed minimal insight into [x]’s needs when he commented that [x] had not missed her mother at all, did not wish to face time her and seemed to prefer his partner [ms ff] to her mother. while [ms westmore] presented very well, it is deeply concerning that she finds herself facing possible incarceration again on similar charges which would see her again removed from [x]’s life. during interview [ms westmore] oscillated between saying she had agreed that in that event [x] would live with her father, and later saying her preference would be that [x] would live with maternal family members in [city r]. ... ... both are potentially loving and capable parents. ... [x] is aged 5 years and 4 months. she presented as a somewhat anxious and reserved child. after [x] was provided a description of the role of the court in family matters and the role of a judge, she quietly said “i just want to live with mummy”. ... [x] presents as a deeply conflicted child who is missing her mother, but also clearly bonded to her father. during brief observations [x] was equally demonstrative with each parent, running to each of them and embracing them eagerly. [x] was asked of her understanding of why her living arrangements had changed. she said “daddy wanted me because he loved me, but i still want to stay with mummy”. at [x]'s young age, she is acutely aware of her parent’s conflict. she could describe being unable to tell her father of her wish to live with her mother as it would make him sad. she said i wouldn't feel good if i made him sad. she said she had told her father once of this wish but he had told her it couldn’t happen. she could also described how she had made a decision not to say nice things about “[ms ff]” (her father's partner) to her mother as that would make her mother sad. at five years of age [x] has already learned to be guarded in the information she shares with each parents as it may have negative consequences for her. [x] is tolerating the amount of change in her life currently but is clearly struggling with the parental conflict with her being clearly caught in the middle. future directions it is respectfully recommended in the absence of information to the contrary that: while there is merit in returning [x] to live in her mother’s primary care, it would be unwise to make this change that meant that there would be another change back to her father in the event the mother was incarcerated. therefore, in the interim it is suggested that [x] remained living with her father.
ms westmore next sentenced to prison
the next family report, ms e, 31 january 2019
... regardless of whether or not she was to serve a term of imprisonment, [ms westmore] proposed for [x] to live with her and spend time with [mr pieters] “three weekends in four... [ellipses in original] from 6pm friday until 6pm sunday...” if she was incarcerated, [ms westmore] suggested that court orders could be worded to ensure [x] returns to her care after she was released from prison. she was confident that this was in [x]’s best interests. [ms westmore] saw no advantage to [x] of living primarily with [mr pieters] on a permanent basis. [ms westmore] suggested that [mr pieters] would not support a co-parenting relationship whereas she would ensure [x] spent regular time with the father.
primary school counselling starts
... in her mother’s house she lived with her older sister and a “cousin”.[30] he could sometimes be a bit rough and squeeze her arms or top of legs. they sometimes came up as bruises. it hurt but she didn’t tell anyone as it might have got mum into trouble. she loved living with her mum as there were no rules and she would buy her gifts all the time. she said she had some worries.

towards the end of the session [x] said she wanted to go and live with her mother again. she missed her very much. she asked if i could do something about this. i explained to her that i had no authority to organize this for her. she was disappointed with this response became a bit distant.   was excited about school holidays. maybe going camping. she was wondering what she might get the christmas from her father and mother. thought she might start making a list. all good at home and school. i felt a shift in her response and attitude to the counselling session. she seemed closed off and didn’t want to discuss her concerns. i believed that it was due to the previous session regarding living with her mother. i asked her if that was the case, and her response was that she didn’t want to talk about it as i couldn’t help her with this problem.

the (next) december 2019 interim report: ‘10 out of 10!’
... [mr pieters’] proposal regarding spend time arrangements altered during interview. he initially stated that [x] “should have a relationship between with her mother down the track”, then suggested supervised time may be appropriate - he said to prevent [ms westmore] influencing [x] or telling her lies - then suggested that if not supervised, short periods of time (e.g. two hours) could occur in public at child friendly venues. he was opposed to overnight time. ... [ms westmore]'s proposal was that [x] should immediately return to her primary care, although she accepted this as unlikely given they have had no time together for nine months. her alternative proposal was that [x] should commence spending every weekend with her from friday to sunday. [ms westmore] resides with her sister and there is a bedroom available for [x]. the parent’s relationship remains deeply conflictual and it appeared neither had progressed from positions or attitudes that have been noted in previous assessments. each continues to remain focused on apportioning blame for emotional harm to [x] upon the other parent and minimised their personal responsibility in these matters, save [ms westmore] acknowledged the emotional toll her recent six month long incarceration would have had on [x], particularly in light of the lack of visitation allowed and the problematic phone communication that occurred. it is of note that, bar two phone calls soon after her release, [mr pieters] has not allowed or facilitated any phone communication or spend time arrangements between [ms westmore] and [x]. [mr pieters] asserted he had acted protectively and furthermore at [x]’s request as she was allegedly scared of her mother, [ms westmore]'s opinion was a deliberate attempt by [mr pieters] to undermine her relationship with [x] ... ... in the main [x] presented as a happy, bubbly child who readily engaged in an interview and play. she appeared intelligent, thoughtful and particularly insightful for a child her age. [x] is reported to be excelling at school both academically and socially. [x] spoke very positively about relationships with both maternal and paternal family and these were clearly of importance to her. during interview, [x] presented as what could only be described as desperately keen to spend time with her mother, “10 out of 10!”. she wanted time to begin immediately, including overnight. [x] was categorical she had never felt scared in her mother’s care other than in relation to incidents involving [ms w], whom she remained very reluctant to spend time with. [x] also wanted to speak regularly on the phone (or similar) with her mother, she said she had always enjoyed phone calls with [ms westmore] apart from one occasion when she heard fighting in the background. she could not recall ever having wanted to end calls prematurely. [x] said she had “felt sad in my stomach” as a result of not spending time with or speaking with her mother. she said her preferred living arrangement would be spending five nights each week with [mr pieters], with her mother collecting her from school every friday, returning to [mr pieters] on sunday. there were occasions when [x] took some time to offer a response regarding her views of spend time arrangements. when asked about this [x] expressed that her hesitance related to how her father may respond, [x] thought her father would be surprised about how she felt as she had not been able to express herself to him previously: “i don’t feel brave enough to say it... he would be sad”. [x] was clear she did not think [mr pieters] would be angry or that she would be punished. despite this, [x] was very clear that if she independently expressed her desire to spend time with or speak to her mother [mr pieters] would not allow this as he believed [ms westmore] had lied to [x]. [x] appeared to find this very frustrating and repeatedly stated her mother had not lied, [x] had made a mistake by misunderstanding her (re whose home [ms westmore] was in). [x]’s three wishes, in summary, were: to spend every weekend with her mother, for her father to allow her to spend time and talk on the phone with [ms westmore], and for her parents “to get along”. [x] was acutely aware that her parents do not like each other although she denied that either parent speaks poorly of the other, but instead do not speak of each other almost at all. an observation of [x], which [x] was particularly keen take place, was delightful to observe. [x] immediately ran into her mother’s arms with a large smile on her face and remained in [ms westmore]'s arms for a number of minutes. they remained in close if not immediate proximity to each other for the duration, with [x] very excitedly engaging her mother in activities and play. conversation was child focussed and appeared “natural” in its flow and content...a number of kisses and embraces were shared with each expressing their love for the other. ... in the absence of evidence to the contrary it is respectfully recommended that: [x] remain in [mr pieters’] primary care. [x] commence spend time with [ms westmore] forthwith.... [recommendations detail time between [ms westmore] and [x] building to overnight time and then to alternate weekends at the commencement of the next school year] ... the parties and their agents be restrained by injunction from: denigrating the other party or any other person directly to [x], or in her presence discussing these proceedings with [x] beyond what is necessary for her to understand the parenting arrangements exposing [x] to any form of family violence exposing [x] to any person who is substance affected [emphasis added]
the december 2019 interim orders: x lives with father and time with mother
february 2020: x’s time with her mother increased to shared care
the (next) september 2020 family report
... in interview [ms westmore] proposed the parties have equal shared parental responsibility, that [x] live in her primary care and spend time with [mr pieters] each alternate weekend and overnight each alternate wednesday, for half of school holidays and that [x] be permitted to communicate with [mr pieters] at [x]’s request. in interview [mr pieters] proposed the current live with and spend time arrangements continue, that [x] spend half of school holidays with [ms westmore] and also on special occasions, he said he preferred that sole parental responsibility rest with him. [mr pieters] proposed [x] be permitted to communicate with [ms westmore] at [x]’s request. ... [ms westmore] said [x] has expressed to her – and allegedly to others as well – that she wants to live with [ms westmore] and that [x] is scared [mr pieters] will find out this is [x]’s preference and be upset with her. [ms westmore] said she is sure that [mr pieters] loves [x] and “provides for her the best he can” however it was her view that [mr pieters’] alleged need to control matters prevented him from prioritising [x]’s wishes. she said [mr pieters] is rigid with spend time arrangements and has not agreed to her requests for extended time, she said she was “more than happy to be flexible” in the future and facilitate additional time. [ms westmore] said that whilst she supports a relationship for [x] with [mr pieters] she was significantly concerned that he is emotionally unavailable to [x] and does not understand her feelings. [ms westmore] said she believes the father actively seeks to undermine her relationship with [x] by restricting their time and communication and that furthermore he threatens [x] with withholding her from [ms westmore] as a method of punishment. [ms westmore] said [x] has told her “he might not let me see you again” ... [mr pieters] was clear that it is his belief [x] will best have her needs met by remaining in his primary care. [mr pieters] said [x] has finally achieved a sense of stability having lived in his primary care for just over two years now and that to disrupt this would be significantly detrimental to her. [mr pieters] stated that “her stability is my main concern” and he lacked confidence this could be provided to [x] in the longer term by [ms westmore]. [mr pieters] said he believes there remains the possibility [ms westmore] could face further criminal charges or even incarceration in the future. he said “i know for a fact” she had been caught stealing from a company in [city r] but the company was not pressing charges as their insurance covered the loss. [mr pieters] said [ms westmore] had also been investigated for unpaid child support and been found to owe him $3000. he said “it’ll all catch up with her at some stage or another” and he did not want [x] to get caught up in it also. he said [ms westmore]'s extensive history of criminal activity and her repeated periods of incarceration are a clear indicator this remains a risk for [x]. ... one cannot underestimate the emotional pressure [x] has endured and the degree of responsibility she has felt being caught between her parents and seemingly having prioritised, or at the very least considered, their emotional needs before her own... it is highly likely [x] will benefit from ongoing therapeutic support not only to help her make some sense of her experiences to date but also in an attempt to repair any harm that has been caused... for an optimal outcome [x] will require a joint narrative from [ms westmore] and [mr pieters]. ... the possibility that [ms westmore] may again engage in criminal behaviour and potentially serve a further period of incarceration is a crucial factor in this matter and in considering [x]’s future parenting arrangements. given that it has been identified in this assessment that [x] urgently requires certainty and the maintenance of long term stability, that [mr pieters] appears very well placed to provide, it is therefore recommended [x] remain in her father’s primary care whilst maintaining regular spend time with [ms westmore]. ... views and/or concerns expressed by a six year old child ([x]’s during the s.11f assessment in december 2019) may potentially be unreliable particularly when taken in the context of that child having experienced an emotionally tumultuous life, they are being provided within the formal and potentially anxiety provoking court setting and when that child has not spent time with a parent for a lengthy period and likely has some understanding that the views they share may alter that circumstance. ... it is a real positive in this assessment to note that despite all of the challenges she has faced [x] has been observed and reported to share loving, positive and affectionate relationships with her parents and with [ms ff] also. she has also been described as sharing a strong peer network and positive relationships with extended family and school staff. this bodes well for [x]’s future development and for her capacity to move on from the identified issues, however she will require the support of her parents and [ms ff] to do so and they must refrain from any behaviour, such as denigration or undermining, that may hinder that process. if the degree of acrimony that has been present were to continue into the future there is a very real risk of further, more substantial and potentially permanent emotional harm being caused to [x]. [ms westmore] and [mr pieters] are strongly encouraged to take this opportunity to prioritise [x], finalise her parenting arrangements and commit to protecting her from further exposure to conflict. [emphasis added]
next child protection and police report: september 2020 abuse allegations
concerns were raised that [x] had disclosed [mr pieters] had grabbed her by the throat after she was crying about a week before the report was received, telling her not to talk about [ms westmore]. it was reported that [x] is often hysterical and extremely upset when returning to [mr pieters’] care, having said on one occasion 2-4 weeks prior to the report, that she wishes she was dead rather than have to go back to [mr pieters]. it appeared that [mr pieters’] behaviours were causing [x] anxiety, distress, and emotional/psychological harm. the child was due to return to [mr pieters’] care on 04/09/2020, according to the fcfcoa orders. [ms westmore] had reportedly sought legal advice. appropriate follow-ups were conducted, and closure was recommended for the following reasons: there was no evidence to support that [x] was at immediate or significant risk of harm in the care of either parent. police were aware of the reported concerns, and able to investigate the matter, discuss any concerns with the father, and advise child protection of any protective concerns identified as a result of the investigation. [h school] was in a position to monitor the situation, refer the family/child to community supports as required, support [x] and the family, and advise child protection of any future protective concerns. the parents were in a position to seek legal advice as required in relation to the family law court orders, and conditions. there was no further role for child protection
final hearing vacated and another report ordered
the (next) “addendum” family report: 9 april 2021
...
... there appears to be an absence of productive communication between the parents as they report they communicate primarily via text message. throughout her interview, [ms westmore] emphasised that [mr pieters] was not supportive of [x]’s relationship with her and repeatedly stated that while she was incarcerated that [x] was not allowed to telephone her and that [x] was not returned to her primary care upon her release and [mr pieters] enrolled her in a new school without her consent. while [ms westmore] was critical of [mr pieters] for failing to return [x] to her primary care upon her being released from her custodial sentence, she failed to express insight into the impact of her ongoing offending behaviours, inclusive of her multiple custodial offences, have contributed to [x]'s instability. ... [ms westmore] sought that [x] be returned to her primary care as she and [x] share a particularly close relationship, and she believes that it is [x]’s desire to live primarily with her. [ms westmore] believes that [x] is unhappy within her father's care and is bored in this environment. ... more recently, [mr pieters] was informed by both [ms westmore] and [x] that [x] had broken her arm on a particular day on at a particular location engaged in a particular activity. following [x]’s observation session, [mr pieters] contacted the writer to report that upon him taking [x] to a follow-up doctor's appointment, he learned that [x] had broken her arm on a different day and in a different city. again, [mr pieters] indicated that he felt there was no need for [ms westmore] to lie to him regarding this information and was disappointed and angry that [x] is asked by her mother to continually maintain her mother’s fabricated version of events. according to [mr pieters], [x] spending additional time with her mother has resulted in her becoming significantly disrupted and belligerent towards him upon returning to his care. he assumes that [x] is exposed to ongoing denigration of him while in her mother’s care for after being separated from her mother for a few days that [x] returns to being a polite, fun-loving and affectionate little girl. both parents report that [x] is progressing well at school and describe her as an engaged and social student with many friends. [x] had historically enjoyed attending [sports]... ... it appears as if the primary purpose for the preparation of this addendum family report was to obtain [x]’s views. [x] was interviewed separately and was also observed in the presence of both of her parents. [x] arrived for her observation session and interview with her father. as the parents wished to remain separate, the writer facilitated [x]’s handovers between her parents. as [x] and the writer approached [ms westmore] and her ‘friend,’ the writer asked [x] the name of her mother's partner/boyfriend, and [x] indicated that her mother did not have a boyfriend. when the writer and [x] moved closer to [ms westmore] and '[mr t]', the writer referred to [mr t] and asked, "do you know his name?" [x] maintained she did not know him. in earlier conversations with [ms westmore] and her friend while waiting for [x], ‘[mr t]’ indicated that he had spent significant time with [x] and [q] and attended holidays together. [mr t] also asked if he was required to attend the observation session with [x] and [ms westmore], while [x] continued to ignore him. ... ...[x] and [ms westmore] appeared to share a positive and affectionate relationship. ...overall, [x] and her mother appear to enjoy a positive and causal relationship, and there were no safety concerns raised for [x] within the care of her mother during this observation session. at the end of their time together, [x] and her mother exchanged a hug, and they each stated, "i love you.” ... in discussing her parents’ relationship, [x] believed that her parents “did not like each other,” however, she indicated that she had not seen them fight. [x] identified that she lived between both of her parents, however, she wanted to live with her mother “most of the time.” in discussing this statement, [x] indicated that she enjoyed playing with her mother and stated that her father did not spend time with her or play with her. [x] indicated that she was bored within her father’s care and that he did not take her anything or do anything with her on weekends. despite making this initial statement, during her interview, [x] proceeded to identify many actives she enjoyed with her father. when spending time with her mother, [x] reported that her mother would take her shopping and buy her things and that she enjoyed playing with and spending time with [q]. [x] also reported that she liked engaging in craft projects with her mother and paying with her [dolls]. when spending time with her father, [x] reported that she enjoyed cooking with him and reported that they would watch movies together. ... ...during their conversation, [x] and her father discussed other games and activities they enjoyed together, which appeared to be contrary to [x] previously informing the writer that her father did not play with her. ... [x] and [mr pieters] appeared to enjoy each other’s company as they tended to tease each other throughout their games. [x] was spontaneously physically affectionate towards her father and would often choose to sit in close proximity to her father. there were no safety concerns raised for [x] in the presence of her father during this brief observation session. ... [x] had experienced a considerably disrupted care history until the past two and a half (2 ½) years during her care with [mr pieters], which has been the most stable and consistent of her young life. ... the primary purpose of this assessment has been to ascertain [x]’s views and wishes pertaining to her parenting arrangements. while [x] initially advocated to spend the majority of her time with her mother, indicating that her father does not spend time with her or play with her, [x] also made statements during her interview and throughout her interview with her father contrary to this position. this assessment suggests that [x] enjoys a positive and engaging relationship with her parents, although these relationships may differ as expected between parents. ...this assessment suggests that [x] continues to live primarily within her father’s care which is likely to provide her with greater stability and to spend time with her mother between four (4) to five (5) nights a fortnight. this assessment also suggests that the court may need to provide [mr pieters] with sole parental responsibility for [x]’s educational and medical decisions.

ms elleray: what was the conversation between you and [x] and [mr t] on the way into the police station regarding what she was going to say to the police? [ms westmore]: i – i didn’t coerce her or tell her what to say. his honour: no. ms elleray: i didn’t ask - - - his honour: that’s not the question, please. ms elleray: i didn’t ask you that? [ms westmore]: i don’t – i don’t remember. i honestly don’t know. she asked to go to the police station. i took her. ms elleray: she asked to go to the police station? [ms westmore]: yes. [x] did. ms elleray: she’s nine at the time? [ms westmore]: she is nine. yes. ms elleray: and she said, “i want to go to the police and make a police statement”? [ms westmore]: no. ms elleray: no? [ms westmore]: i told [x] that she was going to handover to her father. ms elleray: because the school holidays were upon you? [ms westmore]: no. her time was - - - ms elleray: time with her father. and the school holidays were - - -? [ms westmore]: had commenced. ms elleray: yes. yes? [ms westmore]: to which [x] was distraught, did not want to return. ms elleray: so why? what was the conversation in the car on the way to the police station? you’re driving from [city s] to - - -? [ms westmore]: i told her that if - - - ms elleray: - - - [suburb j]? [ms westmore]: she told me she did not feel safe. i told her that if she did not feel safe, i was happy to do changeover in the front foyer of the police station where we used to do it if that made her feel safer. ms elleray: just stop there. the conversation in the car on the way was, “look, i’m happy to be in the police station with you to go back to dad because it’s your time with – you live with dad and you’ve had your time with me.” did you have that conversation? [ms westmore]: no. my conversation with [x] was that she was going back to her father today, to which she said, “i don’t want to. i don’t feel safe,” and i said – i tried to make it easier by saying, “well, how about we go back and do changeover where we used to?” and that was in the foyer of the [suburb j] police station. ms elleray: and none of the things that you’ve sworn to be the truth that you – that are contained in your november 2022 affidavit were raised. you didn’t have any of those thoughts in the back of your mind as you’re going into the police station, all the things you’ve been – all the things you subsequently say about the violent person he is. they weren’t troubling you? [ms westmore]: if i took - - - ms elleray: such that you could do a changeover? [ms westmore]: honestly, what was on my mind that if i took [x] to place where she felt safe that she may have – if they were merely allegations and things that really didn’t happen that she might succumb and he would come in and maybe they would go off together. i took her somewhere where she wanted to be safe, where she felt safe. ms elleray: a police station? [ms westmore]: yes. ms elleray: but in the same – in the same vein, you’re telling her she will be safe in a police station doing a changeover. so do you see the disconnect, [ms westmore]? [ms westmore]: no, i don’t because it has been court ordered previously that that was the safest place for changeovers to occur. ms elleray: in the car park of police stations? [ms westmore]: incorrect. it was in the foyer, and then – in the foyer it was, your honour. it was in the foyer of the [suburb j] police station, and then if you read in a previous family report, it clearly states that the changeovers had become better, so they moved them out to the [suburb j] police station car park. ... [ms westmore]: so in high conflict, fear, anything like that was – the starting point was the police station foyer. that is where [x] felt safe. ms elleray: all right. the point she says to police – and i’m underlining this word for you – is, “i don’t want to go to my dad’s any more.” that for you was what you wanted to hear? [ms westmore]: i did not hear that. ms elleray: you don’t want her to have a - - -? [ms westmore]: she was in a room with a police officer. i was outside of that room. ... ms elleray: but clearly the child has not turned up to changeover, has she? [ms westmore]: well, the child has 15 – child has attended the police station. ms elleray: yes? [ms westmore]: the police have told me to - - - ms elleray: take her home? [ms westmore]: take her home. ms elleray: yes? [ms westmore]: and they would speak with [mr pieters] when he arrived. ms elleray: yes? [ms westmore]: at no point was i directed to bring [x] back.

his honour: [referring to a submission that the document is the text of her application] is that the case, [ms westmore]? [ms pieters]: i – the bulk of it, yes. his honour: which parts aren’t? [ms pieters]: i’m not sure. i did – i requested one or two changes, and i’m not sure what – what they were. i possibly would have requested the date change to 2020 on the september portion. ms elleray: what about the use of the word “strangled”? [ms pieters]: like i said, i didn’t type it up. poorly read it. yes. ms elleray: and what about the reference to “the respondent hurts me nearly every day”? that’s on page 1? [ms pieters]: what [x] has told me. ms elleray: that’s what she told you?

[ms pieters]: i’m not sure. ms elleray: but you’re not – you go forward and put before a court of law this information - - -?

why is [x] not at changeover ?
x’s first attendance on dr g, the psychologist  does not want to see her father. she told me she is “very very scared” of him... ... ... [x] disclosed to me that her father has physically assaulted her on a number of recent occasions. specifically, [x] said that: when her father asked [x] to tidy her bedroom ... as soon as she had finished the task ... [x]’s father then slapped her across the face when [x] visits her father’s house to spend time with him, [x]’s father squeezes her legs when [x] is on the phone to her mother. if [x] tries to tell her mother that she is not enjoying the visit, then [x]’s father will squeeze [x]’s legs harder, causing bruising her father has held her around the throat and squeezed her throat and neck [x] also said that when she spends time with her father, he comments that [x] looks and sounds like her mother. [x] said that she feels a great deal of dread when she has to get ready to stay with her father... ... ... she did not show signs of having been coached ... [x] provided consistent accounts of the abuse she described when asked about it in it number of different ways. [x] said she had previously tried to tell a counsellor at her school about the abuse but the counsellor told [x]’s father what [x] had said. [x] expressed fears that her father will be very angry that she is refusing to go to his house and she said “i know he will do something really bad”. [emphasis added]
the alignment of dr g and dr ee
dear [dr b], we are writing to you regarding [ms westmore] and [x]’s participation in the short form family report assessment scheduled for 15 september. as we have yet to receive subpoenas for our notes or input for this assessment, we have obtained consent from [ms westmore] to reach out to you directly and provide any information that you may find helpful in your assessment. [dr ee] has been [ms westmore]'s treating clinical and forensic psychologist since 2018 on a regular basis. she is also a [specialist] for the children's court clinic and youth justice. she has made past mandatory notification to child protection based on [ms westmore]'s disclosures about [x]’s distress. past family report writers have not taken [ms westmore]'s engagement in long term therapy into consideration in their assessments as [ms westmore]'s custodial sentence appeared to have overshadowed other matters at that time. we hope that being more proactive this time would allow a more holistic view of [ms westmore] to be represented in court. [dr g] has been [x]’s psychologist since july 2022 and has seen [x] seven times so far. [dr g] made a mandatory notification following disclosures from [x] that related to [x]’s father. these disclosures concerned physical and emotional abuse and neglect. since this notification was made, it has become even more clear that [x] is very frightened of her father. all of [dr g]’s sessions with [x] have been conducted without another adult present. [dr g] ... is well versed in issues of child abuse and parental alienation. [dr g] has been helping [x] to manage her fears. due to concerns that [x] will suffer negative impacts from attending an observation session with her father, we would be more than happy for [dr g] to also “attend” the session via phone or video link. we look forward to speaking with you. ... thank you for your assistance with this family. warm regards, [dr ee] and [dr g] [emphasis added]

mother’s position and court orders of 10 august 2022
september 2022, the single expert short form report
... [ms westmore] described [x] as a happy child who enjoy school [and sports]. she said that she had never been diagnosed with a psychological disorder, but had displayed anxiety symptoms in the past, such as hiding in cupboards to avoid going to her father’s home. she acknowledged that [x] enjoyed spending time with her father when time was more limited. ... [x] was interviewed as part of the assessment. [x] volunteered without prompting that she was not prepared to see her father because he had hurt her, and she feared him. she explained that if she did not immediately acquiesce to her father’s requests, such as cleaning her room, he would slap her across the face or squeeze her on the leg. she said that when he learned that she had disclosed the abuse he tried to choke her by placing his hands around her neck. [x] claimed that she had never enjoyed spending time with her father, and had only negative memories of him. [x] could not identify any negative aspects of her time with her mother, and expressed a desire to remain in her full-time care. she reported that she had never been told why her mother had been imprisoned in the past, but believed that it must be because her father was not nice to her. [x] refused to spend time with her father, leaving the room on seeing her father’s presence. no overt signs of fear were observed, beyond a general refusal. such a response to her father was incommensurate with the risk posed. ... it appeared to the assessor that [dr g] had formed her assessment of [x] based on information from [x] and the mother alone without access to the history of family court issues. should the court support the notion that this is an alienation/exclusion matter, it is likely that therapy with [dr g] is intensifying the issues. ... both parents alleged that the other had subjected [x] to derogatory views of the other parent and influenced her to state preferences regarding parenting, as well as withheld time. [x] presented as being emotionally caught in the conflict between her parents, with the current evaluation suggesting that the mother was engaging in a pattern of behaviour to exclude the father. it is relevant that at age nine years, [x] does not demonstrate ambivalence towards her mother or father, which is considered normal in this age group. in contrast, she presents her mother as entirely nonproblematic, and her father the opposite, which is generally an unrealistic picture for children aged nine years. this factor points to her being caught in a resist/refusal pattern. ... mother’s mental health [ms westmore] described a childhood characterised by familial dysfunction, explaining that her parents were alcoholics, her mum left when she was five years of age, and her father was physically and verbally abusive. she said that her father expressed extreme hostility towards their mother, recalling that her sister was often attacked for sharing a physical likeness to their mother. ... psychological evaluation did not identify a current psychological disorder, but she presented with personality problems with antisocial personality traits. it seemed likely that this was underlying her exclusion/alienation pattern. ... it seemed likely that [x] had been subject to ongoing high conflict and instability in care between [mr pieters] and [ms westmore] for over five years. she presented as being aware of the acrimony between her parents and presented with a history of difficulty expressing her views regarding time freely. based on the current evaluation, [x]’s statements regarding time cannot be given weight based on her being caught in a resist/refusal pattern. ... meaningful relationships with both parents are critical to [x]’s development of positive attachment relationships. attachment allows children to develop the secure base necessary to explore their world, relate to others, and regulate their emotions adaptively. in the absence of secure attachment, children are likely to avoid emotional intimacy as adults, and have difficulty trusting others. according to current research on the effect of resist and refuse dynamics, or alienation processes, “in general, severely alienating behaviour may be understood as emotional abuse, particularly when done consciously, with malicious intent and when it clearly places the parent’s needs over those of the child, however there is no clear delineation of when and where that line into abuse is crossed. the determination of whether the favoured parent’s behaviour constitutes abuse may require an independent evaluation by a mental health professional with a specialisation in divorce and alienation.” [citation omitted] ... the likelihood that [x] will be exposed to neglect or abuse in [mr pieters]’s care in this matter was rated as low to moderate. primary risk appeared to relate to exposure to conflict between the parents. there was no substantial evidence to indicate that the father had physically abused/disciplined [x]. his parental risk should be reviewed if the court found that there was evidence of child abuse. the likelihood that [x] will be exposed to neglect or abuse in [ms westmore]’s care in this matter was rated as high. her parenting needs that may have a negative impact on her parenting capacity include: difficulties co-parenting with [mr pieters] and encouraging a relationship between [x] and her father, reflective of an alienation/exclusion pattern personality vulnerabilities related to antisocial personality traits a history of abusive/high conflict relationships a history of abuse as a child parenting difficulties both parents presented as capable of looking after [x]’s basic needs independently and understand her strengths and difficulties, but had difficulty engaging in an effective co-parenting relationship. while each had exposed [x] to denigration of the other parent and had attempted to influence her parenting preferences, this appeared to be more overt and frequent from [ms westmore], thus presenting with a more significant risk profile. ... clinical information indicated that the following parenting factors impact or would impact on [x]’s emotional, psychological, and physical development: ongoing exposure to conflict between her mother and father parents’ difficulty supporting time between [x] and the other parent ongoing engagement in therapy that supported an alienation/exclusion pattern instability in care arrangements ... while family therapy would typically be considered as a preliminary intervention in such matters, it seemed unlikely to be effective in this case. clinical evaluation indicated that there were multiple examples of exclusion demonstrated by the mother, and that to stop this process, there needs to be a separation of time between the mother and [x]. while this will inevitably be a stressful intervention for [x], the long-term benefits outweigh the costs [citation omitted]. recommendations [x] reside with her father without contact or regular contact with the mother for one to three months. this will inevitably be a stressful intervention for [x], and as such it may be helpful for [x] to engage with a therapist in the transition phase to assist with any changes (e.g., psychologist, [ms cc], [phone number]). after one to three months, time between [x] and her mother should be increased gradually in a stepwise fashion commencing with supervised time. progression to in substantial attendance and unsupervised should occur over 12 to 18 months. should the mother demonstrate behaviour consistent with exclusion/alienation, time should revert to supervision or in substantial attendance. [x]’s engagement with psychologist, [dr g] should be ceased. ... any medical or allied health professionals working with [x] or the parents are provided with a copy of this report. [emphasis added]
his honour: ... just dealing with that, [ms westmore] has been unreserved in saying, “look, it was misleading.” but at the moment, i don’t understand...why she would do that. given the psychometric testing that you’ve done and an examination of the materials that you’ve done...i don’t want you to assist me with speculation, but are you able to assist me with any direction or concern (about) that – at that crucial time in [x]’s life? [dr g]: certainly. i think that ...and it was mentioned across... the reports,...there are some personality vulnerabilities with – with [ms westmore] around antisocial personality traits, around deception behaviour. and i guess the more times that – the more evidence there is ...that [ms westmore] has been deceptive lends more evidence to...that’s a part of her personality functioning as opposed to an error at the time. his honour: ...i put to [ms westmore] that she’s describing – something to the effect that she’s describing someone that she’s not, that it’s an alternative person...does it only go to the capacity to be deceptive? or is there anything else raised by it, or is that where i park it? [dr g]: ...it provides some more information about potential exclusionary behaviour. obviously using a different name ... prevents potentially the trail of information.   g]: i think [ms westmore] did show some ambivalence. she reflected that she was looking at professionals to help guide the family and find out what was actually happening. she said that there are many cross-allegations and no-one is really identifying what the issue is for the child. ms elleray: they’re very serious allegations, aren’t they, that the child’s making. i mean strangulation is a very serious allegation for a child to make and the mother tells us on the trial that she’s not sure. did you get that same understanding throughout your session with her, that she’s just not sure what’s going on? [dr g]: yes, my understanding is that she wasn’t sure, but wasn’t prepared to subject [x] to a situation where she may be abused.
child protection speak to x after the family report interviews
child protection do not hold any safety concerns for [x] residing in the primary care of her mother. child protection spoke with [x] [in] october 2022 where she indicated fear of returning to her father’s primary care. [x] disclosed having been previously hit and slapped by her father and reported that she spent most of her time in her room and that her father would not speak or interact with her. [x] has been enrolled in school, is attending daily and is well supported. [ms westmore] has been in regular contact with [x]’s school regarding support for [x] and has been supportive of [x]’s sessions with her psychologist. [ms westmore] is also open to further supports should this be recommended. given the absence of safety concerns for [x] in her mother’s care, child protection intends to cease involvement. child protection considers the federal circuit and family court of australia as the appropriate jurisdiction to determine the parenting arrangements for [x].
ms westmore’s unequivocal restatement of assaults on x
ms morkos: because you’re suddenly in a position to accept that you’re unsure about the allegations and prepared to communicate with him? [ms westmore]: incorrect. i have always said that i am unsure of the allegations. i have never said whether they happened or not.
the 2022 interim proceedings, decision and aftermath
ms mallett: there’s a missed call, i’m going to suggest to you, but that she then returned that call. [x] rang and spoke to you? [mr pieters]: yes. ms mallett: for father’s day. and you then have not rung her again until 21 may of this year? [mr pieters]: that’s correct. ms mallett: why have you not rung and tried to speak to [x] since september? [mr pieters]: well, when your daughter, it is – it’s – it’s written down somewhere when your daughter says to you on the phone that she doesn’t want to speak to you and doesn’t want anything to do with you, she has clearly read that from something and there’s clearly – we can hear someone in the background egging her on, if you like. i stopped ringing her. ... his honour: hang on. hang on. the answer to the question is but why that that’s what happened but you’re being asked - - -? [mr pieters]: why, because – because, one, it really upset me and i – i didn’t want to upset [x].

i have serious concerns about the impact on [x]’s mental health given her state of distress, if she is forced to return to her father. i work with lots of children with psychological illnesses as a general practitioner and [x] appeared in her overall aspect to be acutely terrified of returning to her father. i would have serious concerns for [x]’s physical and mental safety returning to the father in the condition she presented as deposed to above.
... whilst it is still my strongly held view that the father is physically assaulting [x] in the manner in which she has disclosed to me, i am aware that orders of the court are binding and whilst i made an application to stay the proceedings, this was not listed before i was required to comply with the order on 1 april 2023. [emphasis added]
ms elleray: yes. now, at the time of this interview the alleged disclosures that [x] is alleged to have made about her father choking her, strangling her – well, i use the word chokes. placing his hands on her throat. that type of allegation that’s in your affidavit of august 2022. they’re known to you, aren’t they? those disclosures are known to you? [ms westmore]: yes. ms elleray: yes. and you believe those disclosures, don’t you? you believe what [x] tells you? [ms westmore]: no. i don’t believe everything [x] tells me. ms elleray: do you believe her father has choked her? [ms westmore]: i - - - ms elleray: that’s a question. simple yes or no? [ms westmore]: i’m unsure. ms elleray: do you believe he has pushed her against walls? [ms westmore]: i’m unsure. ms elleray: do you believe he has slapped her across the face? [ms westmore]: i’m unsure. ms elleray: do you believe he has pinched her on the top of her thighs leaving bruises? [ms westmore]: i am unsure.[52] ms elleray: you’ve never seen those bruises, have you? there aren’t any? [ms westmore]: i’ve seen bruises on [x]. ms elleray: yes. but have you seen the alleged finger mark bruises on the tops of her thighs that [x] is claiming? [ms westmore]: i’ve seen multiple bruises over [x]. ms elleray: have you seen the finger marks that - - -? [ms westmore]: i’ve seen multiple bruises over [x] and at the time i did not – they did not raise concerns. so i did not question her on them. i thought that they were age-appropriate bruises.

... there are some personality vulnerabilities ... with [ms westmore] around antisocial personality traits, around deception behaviour. and i guess ... the more evidence there is ... that [ms westmore] has been deceptive lends more evidence to that that’s a part of her personality functioning as opposed to an error at the time. ... it provides some more information about potential exclusionary behaviour. obviously using a different name ... prevents potentially the trail of information.[80]
