report of family consultant ms t
... a history of family violence during their relationship, and post-separation, has been reported, and documented by each of the parents, the police and the child and youth protection service (‘cyps’), [city b]. according to [ms kearney], she experienced both physical and verbal abuse perpetrated by [mr mcmaster] prior to separation, including being locked out of her house on more than one occasion, and a threat made by [mr mcmaster] to “kill” her (cyps, [kearney, mcmaster] s69zw material, dated 09/05/22). [ms kearney] reported that, during her relationship with [mr mcmaster], and post-separation, the children witnessed family violence perpetrated by [mr mcmaster]. family violence orders (‘fvo’s) have been obtained by [ms kearney] to protect her and the children from [mr mcmaster], including an fvo obtained [...] subsequent to an incident of family violence perpetrated by [mr mcmaster] towards [ms d] that was, reportedly witnessed by [y]. during the incident, [mr mcmaster] allegedly tried to “strangle” [ms d] and threatened to “kill” her. according to [mr mcmaster], his arrest after this incident, when he allegedly breached an fvo and returned to the house he shares with [ms d], the “police got it wrong”, so the situation has now become a “malicious prosecution case” (family assessment, 25/08/22). most recently, it was ordered (order of 26/08/22) that [ms kearney] and her instructing solicitor be granted leave from a federal circuit and family court of australia hearing to attend the magistrates court to obtain an fvo after it was disclosed that, during a phone conversation involving [mr mcmaster], [ms d], and [mr mcmaster]’s (then) legal representative, [mr mcmaster] made the comment “f... the system, kill the bitch” (affidavit, sealed on 29/08/22), although it was, reportedly, unclear to whom the threat was directed ([ms kearney] or the (then) independent children’s lawyer) (order of 26/08/22). in her affidavit filed on 16/09/22, [ms d] denied hearing [mr mcmaster] make the alleged comment. [mr mcmaster] also denied making the comment stating that he would not “jeopardise the recent progress and contact with the children” by making such a comment (affidavit filed on 16/09/22). the issue of alcohol misuse has been raised by each of the parents. according to [ms kearney], [mr mcmaster]’s consumption of alcohol, at times, preceded incidents of family violence. at the family assessment [mr mcmaster] denied misuse of alcohol, although he admitted that, on the night of the incident in [late] 2020 he had had “a couple of drinks”. [mr mcmaster] stated that he has “no reason to misuse alcohol”, stating that he was “run over by a drunk driver” when he was a child, resulting in his now having a [medical condition]. [mr mcmaster] stated that, as a [transport worker], “self-testing” for drugs or alcohol reduces insurance premiums. he stated that he has no ‘dui’ offences. [mr mcmaster] stated that he has returned a negative result for drug testing. at the family assessment [ms d] stated that [mr mcmaster] has not completed hair follicle testing for alcohol as it is too expensive. [mr mcmaster] raised his concern that [ms kearney] has consumed alcohol and then driven with the children in her car. ... [mr mcmaster] claims that [ms kearney] has prevented the children from spending time with him, subsequent to the family violence incident ([late 2020]) that he claimed was an “isolated” incident. [mr mcmaster] stated that, after the occurrence of the incident, [ms kearney] permitted [y] to spend time with him, suggesting that she was not concerned about the safety of the children. in his outline of a case (interim hearing) filed on 22/08/22, [mr mcmaster] stated that [ms kearney] “stopped all communication” between him and the children under the guise of ensuring that [mr mcmaster] would not try to influence [y]’s evidence at the criminal hearing related to the incident. [ms kearney] disputes [mr mcmaster]’s parenting capacity and style. she described [x] as an “anxious person”, whose anxiety is not acknowledged by [mr mcmaster]. [ms kearney] claimed that [mr mcmaster]’s “tough love” approach results in an increase in [x]’s level of anxiety. [ms kearney] provided the example of [mr mcmaster]’s insisting that [x] catch a bus to collect new glasses, a situation that resulted in the maternal grandfather assisting [x] due to her level of distress. this incident occurred [in late 2022]. [x] subsequently refused to spend time with [mr mcmaster] so was not present at his house when the family violence incident occurred. ...

[y] stated that [mr mcmaster] has christmas presents for him. he stated that he gets on well with [mr mcmaster]. he described his relationship with [ms d] as “okay”. [y] stated that, previously, he had his own room at [mr mcmaster]’s house, however, he will now have to share a room with [e].

[x] stated that she enjoys “hanging out” with her cousins when the family visits ‘nan’ and ‘pop’ (maternal grandparents). during the observation session involving [ms kearney] and [y], [x] did not actively participate in the activities selected by [y] and [ms kearney], spending her time engrossed in her phone. [x] described her relationship with [mr mcmaster], [ms d] and [e] as “good”. she described the recent zoom sessions with [mr mcmaster] as “good”. [x] stated that she worries that she will not see [mr mcmaster] again and expressed a wish to spend time with him ([mr mcmaster]) again.

[y] participated actively in the observation session involving [mr mcmaster], [ms d], [x] and his step-siblings. he presented as relaxed and comfortable in the family group. ... the interaction between [ms kearney] and [y] suggested a good relationship between them. [x]’s reluctance to join the play was not hostile, rather it appeared to be a response typifying teenage behaviour. while [ms kearney] was not successful in her efforts to have [x] join the game, she ([ms kearney]) continued to include [x] in the conversation, although her body language suggested that she was feeling somewhat frustrated by [x]’s lack of cooperation. ... the interaction between the participants was appropriate, although, initially, a little stilted. [mr mcmaster] and [ms d] engaged with each of the subject children appropriately. the children included their younger half-siblings in the session activities. [x] was more actively involved in the session than she was in the session involving [ms kearney] and [y]. the children assisted with packing away the play equipment without hesitation. the subject children presented as relaxed during the session. evaluation this report considers the future care and living arrangements for the subject children (the ‘children’), [x], aged 14 years [...], and [y], aged 10 years [...]. the parents are [ms kearney] (the applicant), and [mr mcmaster] (the respondent). the subject children are the only children born during the relationship between [ms kearney] and [mr mcmaster]. [ms kearney] has no other children. [mr mcmaster] has two children, [e], aged five years [...], and [f], aged [one year], born during his relationship with [ms d]. at the time of the family assessment, the children have been living with [ms kearney] for the past two years, with no contact with [mr mcmaster], until two recent zoom sessions (september 2022). contact with [mr mcmaster] was ceased subsequent to he, and [ms d] being involved in an incident of family violence, witnessed by [y], who heard the argument and was reported to be distressed when collected from the police station by [ms kearney]. prior to this situation arising, the children spent time with both [ms kearney] and [mr mcmaster] in a 50/50 shared care arrangement. the children were interviewed individually during the family assessment. [x] presented as a friendly adolescent. she reported having a “good” relationship with [ms kearney], with [y], who she finds to be “loud all the time”, and with the maternal grandparents. she stated that she enjoys “hanging out” with her cousins. [x] was reluctant to participate in the observation session involving [ms kearney] and [y], despite [ms kearney]’s efforts to include her in the activities. [x] reported having a “good” relationship with [mr mcmaster] and [ms d]. she described the recent zoom sessions with [mr mcmaster] as “good”. [x] actively participated in the observation session involving [mr mcmaster], [ms d], [y] and her step-siblings, joining in the play, offering conversation, and noted to “giggle” at times. [x] stated that she worries that she will not see [mr mcmaster] again, and expressed a wish to spend time with him again. [y] presented as friendly and talkative. he reported an enjoyment of sport, stating that he is the “best” in his class at [athletics]. [y] described his relationship with [ms kearney] as “good” and his relationship with [x] as “very good”, despite their fighting at times. [y] was observed to interact well with [ms kearney], suggesting that he feels comfortable and secure in his relationship with [ms kearney]. [y] stated that he gets on well with [mr mcmaster] and has an “okay” relationship with [ms d]. [y] participated actively in the observation session involving [mr mcmaster], [ms d], [x] and his half-siblings, with the youngest child, ‘[y’] sitting on his lap, at times, during the session. [y] described the recent zoom sessions with [mr mcmaster] as “good”, stating that he spoke with [mr mcmaster] about what he has been doing. [y] expressed a wish to spend time with [mr mcmaster] again, making suggestions as to how the contact could evolve. [ms kearney] reported a history of family violence during her relationship with [mr mcmaster], and post-separation., perpetrated towards both her and the children that has resulted in her taking fvos against [mr mcmaster] to protect herself and the children. [ms kearney] stated that prior to separation she experienced physical and verbal abuse perpetrated by [mr mcmaster], including a threat to “kill” her. post-separation, [ms kearney] reported being verbally abused by [mr mcmaster], the verbal abuse being witnessed by [x]. she reported that [x] experienced “difficult” situations with [mr mcmaster], for example, the situation of [mr mcmaster]’s instructing [x] to catch a bus to collect her glasses, giving no thought to [x]’s anxiety, much less her inexperience with catching buses by herself, a situation that resulted in her ([x]’s) not wishing to spend time with [mr mcmaster] ([late 2020]). [ms kearney] stated that, subsequent to the incident of family violence that occurred [in late 2020], during which [ms d] was physically assaulted and, allegedly, threatened to be “killed” by [mr mcmaster], [y] experienced nightmares that were addressed through counselling. [ms kearney] stated that, until she was informed by cyps that there had been physical violence between [mr mcmaster] and [ms d] during the incident, she permitted the children to spend time with [mr mcmaster], however, she withdrew contact between the children and [mr mcmaster] after she was informed that there was physical abuse, witnessed was by [y]. an fvo was obtained by [ms kearney] to protect herself and the children. at the family assessment [mr mcmaster] expressed no remorse about the incident that resulted in the children’s time with him being suspended. rather, he reported his concern that [ms kearney] and her legal representatives have continually “fabricated” stories about his behaviour to ensure that the children are not able to spend time with him. [mr mcmaster] has, more recently, also questioned the validity of recent report made to the court that he was overheard to make a threat to “kill” a female, during a conversation between his then legal representative and [ms d], stating that the legal representative had not validated the authenticity of either [ms d] or himself during the conversation. [ms kearney] was advised to take an fvo to protect her and the children. [mr mcmaster] has not taken any responsibility for his behaviour, over time, rather apportioning blame for incidents on other people. for example, at the family assessment [mr mcmaster] informed the family consultant that [ms kearney]’s ceasing to allow the children to spend time with him was based solely on the incident that occurred [in late 2020], making no reference to previous situations of abuse or family violence. there is no indication that [mr mcmaster] has attempted to address either anger or emotional regulation issues, over time, suggesting that [mr mcmaster] has not considered the impact of his behaviour on other people, including the children. [ms d] presents as being supportive of [mr mcmaster] (including his behaviour) leaving the children potentially vulnerable to abuse, including verbal or psychological abuse if she is not able to recognise or mitigate inappropriate behaviour perpetrated by [mr mcmaster]. a number of reports have been made to cyps related to [mr mcmaster]’s concerns about [ms kearney]’s capacity to appropriately parent the children. the reports raise concerns about [x]’s weight, the children being unsupervised, the children’s attendance at school, and [ms kearney] driving while intoxicated, with the children in the car. [mr mcmaster] questioned [ms kearney]’s mental health status, suggesting that she might be mixing medication and alcohol. the reports have not been substantiated by cyps, with a “no further action” outcome, after each investigation. [ms kearney] reported her concern that [mr mcmaster]’s consumption of alcohol was often a precipitating factor in family violence incidents. [mr mcmaster] admitted that he had consumed a small amount of alcohol prior to his argument with [ms d] but denied that his use of alcohol is problematic, stating that, as a [transport worker], he “self-tests” for drugs and alcohol to lower insurance premiums. [mr mcmaster] has raised concerns about [ms kearney]’s consumption of alcohol. the relationship between the parents is acrimonious suggesting that a co‑parenting or shared care responsibility for the care of the children will be difficult to manage. the ‘talking parents’ app has previously been used by the parents to communicate about the needs of the children. [mr mcmaster] has raised his concern that [ms kearney]’s messages are often difficult to interpret. however, it appears that this form of communication can still be utilized successfully in the future. the children present as settled and secure, at the home of [ms kearney], who is well supported by extended family members. they need, however, to continue to be encouraged to participate in out of school activities, particularly [x] who reports that she does not spend time with her friends away from school. the children need also to have the opportunity to develop a meaningful relationship with [mr mcmaster], [ms d] and their young half-siblings, however, [mr mcmaster]’s “hands on parenting” approach to teach the children “life skills” suggests that [mr mcmaster] might not be congruent to meeting the children’s developmental needs, but will, rather, follow his own beliefs related to parenting. each child, however, has expressed a wish to again spend time with [mr mcmaster] and his family which needs to be considered from the perspective of keeping the children safe. the children need to be provided with the opportunity to talk about situations that trouble them, preferably with a qualified external agent with whom they are able to develop a trusting relationship and speak openly about their worries, in a safe environment. [ms kearney] seeks an incremental increase in the amount of time the children spend with [mr mcmaster]. [mr mcmaster] seeks a return to the 50/50 shared care arrangement “straight away to avoid future problems”. recommendations based on the family assessment, and review of available documentation related to the matter, it is respectfully suggested that, a) [ms kearney] has sole parental responsibility for the children, b) the children spend supervised face-to-face time with [mr mcmaster] for two hours, each fortnight for four sessions, c) the children then spend unsupervised face-to-face time with [mr mcmaster] for two hours, each fortnight for four sessions, d) the time the children spend with [mr mcmaster] increases by two hours each session, on one day on each alternate weekend, until an eight hour timeframe is reached, e) the children spend a weekend each fortnight with [mr mcmaster], commencing from after school on friday until 03:00pm on the following sunday afternoon, f) the children are at liberty to return to the care of [ms kearney] at any time, when spending time with [mr mcmaster], g) the children are referred to an experienced counsellor/psychologist to assist them address emotional/psychological issues, h) [mr mcmaster] is restrained from consuming alcohol when the children are spending time with him, neither parent denigrates the other parent in front of any of the children, or in situations where the children might overhear derogatory comments made about either parent j) the parents continue to communicate via the ‘talking parents’ app, acknowledging the communication of either parent.

submissions on behalf of the applicant
outline these submissions are provided in accordance with the orders of judge neville made on 3 february 2023 after the abandonment of the hearing, as described below. the matter proceeded to hearing on 8 & 9 december 2022 and then on 3 february 2023. on the last-mentioned date, the father refused to participate further in cross examination. the impact of this decision by the father is discussed below. it is the mother’s case that the children should return to having a relationship with the father but that any arrangements for them to do so must be cautious. the father clearly has anger management and behavioural issues and he should be required to address these issues before substantial increases in time can occur. the father’s, and his partner’s, attitude to the mother are extraordinary and negative. they jointly blame the mother for the serious incident of violence between them [in late] 2020. the father also blames the mother for his arrest [in late] 2020 and subsequently being held in custody on remand. there can be no objective rationale that would lead to a conclusion that the mother was in any way involved in those incidents. evidence relied upon and impact of father’s actions on 3/2/2023 as stated above, the father refused to further engage with the hearing after 2 or 3 questions were asked of him on 3 february 2023. initially he stormed out of the courtroom and only came back about an hour later, declining to return to the witness box. cross examination of the father had not concluded. the father’s partner was due to be cross examined as was the family report writer. as a result of the father’s actions, none of this occurred. as submitted on 3 february 2023, given the father’s actions, this matter should proceed on an undefended basis. the mother has been denied procedural fairness given that cross examination of the father was not able to be completed and there was no cross examination of the father’s partner. a hearing to be determined on an undefended basis proceeds on the basis that the evidence of the mother (in this case) should generally be accepted at its highest (unless contradicted by independent corroborative evidence). on the contrary, the evidence of the father and his other witnesses should not be accepted unless they are, agreed by the mother, corroborated by objective independent evidence or given against interest and not contradicted by the mother. in addition to the documents identified in the mother’s case outline filed on 7 december 2022, the mother relies upon the further documents tendered in her case and identified in the consolidated exhibit list filed in chambers. that document also has an explanation of the basis of the additional tender documents (noting that this was not able to occur in the usual way). the mother seeks orders in accordance with her amended minute of orders filed contemporaneously with these submissions. essentially, she seeks sole parental responsibility, that the children live with her, that [x] spends time with the father in accordance with her wishes and during times that [y] is spending time with the father, and that [y] spend time with the father for specified periods building up to a 3/11 arrangement if the father completes the [nn program]. key issues parental responsibility the mother adopts the submissions made on behalf of the icl paragraphs 14 – 30. the matters addressed below relating to family violence and the father’s attitude to the mother strongly support an order for sole parental responsibility. family violence it is submitted that the court would find that the father has engaged in significant and serious family violence over a number of years and in a number of different contexts. in particular, more recently, the court would accept that the incidents that occurred [in late] 2020 occurred as set out in the unredacted versions of those incidents (exhibit m3). the father had previously engaged in family violence towards the mother. the court should fully accept the mother’s versions of these events as set out in her affidavit material. in addition, the court would find that the father, in frustration or anger, said to his then solicitor or within her hearing the words “fuck the system, kill the bitch!”. the court would also accept that these words were directed at the mother. the father has little or no insight into his own behaviour. a reading of his own affidavit material and that of his partner, shows no version of facts upon which the father could have been found guilty of a criminal assault on 2 separate occasions (1 against the mother and the other against his current partner). he was incapable of recognising that his behaviour (even when just limited to his version of those events) constituted family violence or, in particular, an assault. for example, he did not consider that punching the wall within about 4 inches of the mother’s head would constitute an assault. similarly, he did not consider that forcibly picking the mother up and putting her outside the house against her will constituted an assault. it is noted that the father clearly breached the family violence order obtained by police to protect [ms d]. it is equally clear that he was ultimately found not guilty of that charge as a result of [ms d]’s letter to the magistrate identifying that she and the father believed that there was an exception to the order that permitted the father to be at the house. that belief was clearly wrong but was a basis on which the court could conclude that he did not have the required mens rea for the offence. the father’s frustration and anger on the last day of hearing shows that he continues to have significant issues with controlling his behaviour when frustrated or angry. there is a difference between the icl’s proposed orders and the mother’s proposed orders relating to when time would progress. the mother and the icl agree that the father should be required to undertake the extensive ‘[nn program]. the icl proposes that the father’s time progress beyond supervised time once the father has provided evidence relating to his alcohol consumption (see below) and when he has partially completed the course. the mother proposes that the father’s time does not progress beyond supervised time until he has completed the course and provided hair follicle test results which are negative for use of alcohol and illicit substances. given the significant deficits the father shows in his ability to manage his own behaviour, it is submitted that any extension of time beyond supervised should await satisfactory completion of these steps. father’s attitude to his children and to his responsibilities as a parent the mother agrees that the children love their father and would like to have a relationship with him. this is borne out by the children’s comments to the family report writer. the mother supports the children having a relationship with their father subject to it being safe to do so. her position is entirely child-focused and appropriately cautious as a result of the various risk factors. the father has had a number of different positions before the court many of which have had no child focus but are rather focused on the father’s perceived grievances and his desire for the mother to suffer some indignity or loss of relationship with the children as punishment for her supposed actions. for example, in his initial response filed in these proceedings he sought a reversal of primary care and for the mother’s time to be suspended for a period of time or, in the alternative, that the children be placed into foster care rather than in the mother’s care. his position at trial was consistently that he would walk away from the children if the court did not order an equal time arrangement. in cross examination he conceded that he might still maintain a relationship with the children if the court ordered that the children spend up to 5 nights per fortnight with him. he remained adamant that he would not spend time with the children if the arrangement ordered was less nights than this per fortnight. the father also proposed that any progression of time be rapid and that he not be required to undertake the intensive behavioural management course proposed by the mother and icl. the father’s seeks rapid progression to equal time despite not having spent any time with the children since [late] 2020. the father’s attitude shows no insight into the likely impact on the children of these positions. the parties all agree that the children would like to have a relationship with the father. an equal time arrangement or similar would not be in the best interests of the children. this seems obvious in the circumstances of this matter, given the continued inability of the father to control his behaviour, strong negative opinions held by the father against the mother and an utter inability of the parties to communicate and cooperate effectively. a father with the best interests of his children in mind would be accepting of any time that is available to him even if not his desired amount of time. during the christmas 2022 period the father was offered time with the children but did not accept the time offered. he had proposed different arrangements and, when the mother declined those and offered alternatives, he chose to spend no time at all with the children (exhibit (d) of exhibit list). this is consistent with his attitude stated to the court a number of occasions that, unless he gets the outcome he wants, he will walk away. the children would likely be devastated if the father were to proceed with his stated plan to walk away from them unless he gets an outcome that he considers to be appropriate. father’s attitude to the mother the father and his partner hold extraordinary and negative attitudes towards the mother. some aspects of this attitude were not able to be cross examined about as a result of the father’s actions on the last day of trial. because of this some of the additional evidence will be explored briefly here. on the night of the incident [in] september 2020 the father’s partner attributed the father’s behaviour to “issues involving a former partner”. this is a repeated theme of both the father and his partner. even the father’s partner’s outburst towards the mother when leaving the [city b] magistrates court [in] may 2022 was directed at blaming the mother for seeking to protect her children and herself. the irrational argument that the mother was to blame for the family violence that occurred between the father and his partner and the father’s subsequent arrest for breach of a family violence order has been articulated by them in their documents before the court and in submissions made to others. for example, the child support agency undertook an assessment of a review application made by the mother related to the father’s declaration of income levels below $10,000 per annum. that decision is set out at annexure x of the mother’s trial affidavit affirmed 18 november 2022 at page 127 & following. the following statements were made by the father to the child support agency as part of that assessment:- that the mother had obtained a court order preventing him from going near his partner and this prevented him from working for the business that she conducts, that he was sent to jail (sic) because of the mother, that he was sent to jail due to claims made by the mother and that as a result he could not be on the [work] roster for accidents, that the mother simply returns the children to him if she doesn’t get child support. it is noted that the father does not pay child support and the mother has not returned them to his care, apart from showing that the father is willing to lie to obtain an outcome that he desires, those comments to the child support agency show the extraordinary and negative attitude that he holds towards the mother. he considers that, somehow, the mother is responsible for his actions towards his partner [in late] 2020 and that she is responsible for his arrest and being held in custody after his arrest [in late] 2020. neither of these things had anything to do with the mother. effectively the father’s position is that he behaved violently towards his partner as a result of being frustrated towards the mother about an event that happened [in late] 2020 regarding the child [x]. this included the child being so distressed that she ultimately refused to return to the father’s care. this failure to accept responsibility for his own actions is clear from the father’s material and the manner in which he has run his case. the mother seeks an order permitting her leave to provide to services australia documents filed by the father in these proceedings, or in which the father is recorded as making statements regarding his employment, income and financial circumstances within the proceedings (such as affidavit material, family report and transcripts). it is clear from the father’s presentation and statements to the court on the third day of trial that he is undertaking employment, despite his claims and objections to the contrary to services australia. the father’s inconsistent and changeable claims about his caregiving responsibilities to his children with [ms d] to that agency, and his work commitments to her/their business to this court, are clearly motivated to avoid his legal obligation to maintain the children subject to these proceedings. such matters are also relevant to section 60cc(3)(ca). failure to provide full and frank disclosure and other obfuscation throughout the proceedings the father showed an unwillingness to comply with his obligations of full and frank disclosure. this included, for example, not providing the brief of evidence in accordance with an order of the court (order 7 made on 11/5/2021). at no stage during the proceedings did the father provide a copy of the family violence order obtained by the police to protect [ms d] [in late] 2020. a copy of the record of interview of [y] in relation to the events [in late] 2020 was only provided on the 1st day of trial, notwithstanding repeated requests for same. the proceedings were delayed to await the outcome of the criminal trial relating to the charges against the father. when asked, via email directly from the court of the outcome of those criminal proceedings, the father responded only that he was not found guilty of breaching the family violence order. his email did not even mention that he had pleaded guilty to a charge of assault against his partner and a charge of damaging property. given the nature of the incidents that occurred [in late] 2020, and the involvement of alcohol on the father’s part in both of those incidents, the mother, reasonably, sought orders for hair follicle testing for alcohol consumption. the father argued against such orders being made, but an order was nonetheless made. it had been expected that those results would be available before the interim hearing that was scheduled for 26 august 2022. no results were provided prior to this interim hearing. even by the time of the trial in december 2022, or even the adjourned date in february 2023, the father had still not provided hair follicle testing regarding alcohol. legislative pathway (relevant parts only) section 60cc(2)(a) – the children have had a good relationship with the father in the past but have not spent any significant time with their father since [late] 2020. the father has not taken the opportunity to have video calls with his children as often as permitted by court orders. section 60cc(2)(b) – the issue is largely addressed above. there is a significant risk to the children relating to the likelihood of being exposed to family violence issues or being the subject directly of family violence from the father. when he is frustrated, tired, angry or intoxicated he appears to be unable to control his emotional response. section 60cc(3)(a) – as stated above, the children expressed the view that they would like to return to spending time with their father. the mother supports this proposition provided it can be done safely. section 60cc(3)(b) – the children’s relationship with the father has already been addressed. section 60cc(3)(c) & (ca) – the father does not pay any or any significant child support. despite the funds for the setting up of the [transport] business coming from his property settlement with the mother, the business has been set up so that the father’s partner controls the business and he alleges he simply earns a wage. the father then says, contradictorily, both that he is the primary carer of his children with [ms d] and that he has to work long hours in the business as a reason as to why he should not be compelled to undertake the courses proposed by the mother and the icl. to the child support agency, he maintains that his income is at subsistence level only. the father can, but chooses not to, support the children. section 60cc(3)(f) – the mother has a proven capacity to provide for all of the needs of the child. from the family report, it is clear that the children are settled and secure in the mother’s care. the father has significant deficits in his ability to provide for the needs of the children, especially emotional needs. section 60cc(3)(i) – already addressed. section 60cc(3)(j) – already addressed. section 60cc (k) – there have been previous family violence orders between the parties and between the father and [ms d]. the mother has a current interim family violence order that was obtained after the threat to kill by the father [in] august 2022. a final hearing is scheduled for that application [in] april 2023. any other factor - a difficult issue for the court relates to the father’s repeated stated intention to walk away from the children, if he doesn’t get his desired result. the court should not allow the father to blackmail the court into any order beyond that which is in the best interests of the children. summary on an undefended basis the court should accept the mother’s evidence at its highest and reject the father’s evidence, not least because of the lack of an opportunity to test his evidence in cross examination. the father has shown himself to be a person who has difficulty controlling his behaviour or emotional responses in a variety of different scenarios. his storming out of the courtroom on 3 february 2023 was the most recent example of such behaviour. in those circumstances the court should not make orders for unsupervised time until the father has completed the program proposed by the mother and the icl. the children may benefit from a relationship with their father but only if their time with him is safe. it is likely that the father will decide not to obtain a hair follicle test (notwithstanding previous orders or any final orders made) or engage with the ‘[nn program]’. he considers that he does not require either of these. he has shown that he will disregard orders if he does not agree with them. indeed, his stated intention is that he will not spend any time with the children unless he gets orders that he wants. the court should not give in to his demands.
submissions on behalf of the respondent
proceedings the father was the applicant in previous proceedings resulting in 50/50 equal shared care between the parties on a week about arrangement in 2018. the parties and icl agreed to orders by consent the day prior to final hearing. the abovementioned proceedings did include a family report conducted by [ms gg] on 7 march 2018 with the following risk factor considerations:
“child safety and wellbeing 11. concerns expressed by [mr mcmaster] about [ms kearney]’s care. alcohol and substance use 12. no significant issues were identified. mental health 13. no significant concerns were identified.” the father does not agree that the court should consider that this matter should proceed on an undefended basis, as submitted by the mother. the matter was set down for a two day hearing. the father and his partner were in attendance in full for both of those days. there was no trial plan and a number of hours were inefficiently used on the first day of trial in an attempt to negotiate between the parties which could have been done an and fdr that failed to proceed while the father did not complete his cross-examination, nevertheless there is a considerable amount of the father’s evidence that was tested under cross-examination. there is no procedural unfairness to the mother in this evidence from the father being used and considered in the usual way for these types of proceedings. further, in the father’s case generally, there is other corroborative evidence in the proceedings that is relied upon in support of the assertions put forward. this is specifically so in relation to the alleged fvo breach, where there is evidence in the father’s tender bundle demonstrating that [ms d] was not in the house when the father returned and allegedly breached the order. for these reasons, the court should not take the blanket position in the father’s evidence and case that the entirety of the mother’s evidence should be unquestionably adopted and/or accepted at its highest. it is further submitted by the father that whilst the mother’s legal representation remained the same through the entire course of the proceedings dating back to 2020, the father remained self-represented for the majority. the father was appointed a section 102na grant which required him to rely on an appointed lawyer and barrister to run cross-examination. the father’s barrister indicated that she was unable to file the submissions of the father as some questions, scenarios and entire topics that the father sought to rely on in his submissions had not been put to the mother under cross-examination. it is therefore argued by the father that his barrister was ill equipped, not by skill but by preparation time, and sufficient / adequate cross-examination of the mother did not occur.
the father’s position, broadly stated fundamentally the father seeks a return to the equal shared parental responsibility and week-about shared custody of the children arrangement which was working satisfactorily until it ceased in [late] 2020. this care arrangement is also supported by [y] in particular. the father is willing to take something less than week-about initially so long as it is “meaningful time”, which he indicated in court that he considered to be at least a 9:5 arrangement. the father’s position has changed over time as he has accessed more evidence and received professional advice. his initial response to the mother’s application was motivated by frustration in that such issues could not be resolved amicably with discussion. it is to his credit that over time, his position in these proceedings has evolved. noting [x]’s age by the time of this stage of the proceedings, the father is content for [x] to decide when she wishes to spend time with him, but he wishes to have significant meaningful time with her as well as [y]. the father does not support the proposal that would have him spend time with [x] only at a time where he is already spending time with [y]. the father asks the court to make orders that would facilitate any wish expressed by [x] at any time to spend time with her father. this would allow the father an opportunity to build their relationship and adapt his parenting according to her needs. at the family report interview with [ms t] on 22 september 2022 [x] indicated that she was not particularly concerned about the argument between [mr mcmaster] and [ms d] in 2020, she stated she was worried she would never see her dad again and when asked if she had one wish what would it be, [x] replied “i wish to see my brother and dad again.” at the time of the abovementioned family report in september 2022 [y] mentioned he continues to follow [a sports team] because his dad likes that team. [y] also stated he would like to start spending time with his dad again, initially indicating for a couple of hours, then a day and finally “week by week like it use to be”. [y] indicated he was not worried by the fight between [ms d] and the father. there were orders of this court made by consent on 11 april 2018, which, by 2020, provided for week-about shared custody of the children. both the mother and the father had equal shared parental responsibility, in line with the statutory presumption. although there were on occasion difficulties and friction between the mother and the father in giving effect to the 11 april 2018 order, by and large, the process set down for shared time was working well. the mother’s new submissions that the circumstances surrounding her agreement to the orders signed by consent in 2018 are not congruent with her evidence that the father spent time at the hospital with the her, her family and the children during the time in which her sister was dying. it is further noted that the mother indicates it was her decision to “agree” to the orders the father proposed. it is submitted by the father that all the parties were in agreeance that the orders were in the best interests of the children, including himself, independent children’s lawyer and the family consultant. this is a consistent theme that the mother holds, that the children are first and foremost hers and the father shall, only at her approval be “allowed” to access the children. this is further supported in the mother’s resistance to the father requesting supervised, meaningful time with the children over the christmas break in 2022/2023 and the mother denying any variation other than only the proposal she sought in return. it is submitted that the mother has used the pretext of the family violence incident with [ms d] [in late] 2020 to re-agitate issues of custody and parental responsibility that previously had been working satisfactorily. it is also submitted that this has been occurring since the time of the 2018 orders whereby the mother continues to breach the orders made by withholding or removing one or both of the children from the father’s care. this has not been explored by the court nor have their been any consequences imposed on the mother and no make- up time provided to the father. the father wishes that the children should have the flexibility to express their desires to see him and that when such a desire has been expressed that it should be permitted to occur. moreover, the father wishes to re-engage with the children’s school communities and extra-curricular activities that he has been excluded from in recent times. broadly speaking, the father’s statements about the future course he might adopt should he not succeed in the orders he seeks are expressions of his passion for his children, both [y] and [x], but also the children he has with [ms d]. the father remains at all times willing to spend time with [y] and [x] in accordance with their wishes and they are welcome to attend his house at any time. contrary to the submissions of the mother, these statements were not put forward as demands or blackmail so that the court accedes to the orders he proposes. at the time of making the orders in 2018, the father accepted the mother’s view that [y], who was almost two at the time, would need some time to transition to the shared care arrangement. the father agreed [y]’s young age was a factor that needed considering. the mother now criticises the father’s position that he needs to prioritise the age of his young children in making decisions for all of his children. a number of the orders sought by the mother and supported by the icl will have significant coercive effects upon the father, in time and in cost, and in the specific case of the [nn program], significant absence from his family when he is the primary day-time carer for his two small children. in saying that he will need to balance the impact of orders about [x] and [y] with the consequential impact on his other children, the father is displaying child‑focussed thinking for his youngest children. he is also managing the real time risk and impact on all of his children should his time recommence and then be restricted again which has been the case repeated in the past. the father accepts that his decision to end the presentation of his case part‑way through his cross-examination was not the court’s preferred course of action. the father does not accept, as suggested by the icl, that this was an example of his inability to cope with situations or regulate his emotions in situations he finds challenging. as the father said on the day, he was significantly affected by fatigue and he felt it better overall to accept the court’s decision based on the evidence that had been presented to that point, rather than risk his case by continuing to presenting it while impaired. the father submits that on the contrary it indicates insight and mindfulness in relation to the impacts of his actions. the father demonstrates the ability to walk away from situations that he finds stressful and difficult. this is a conscious decision he has made to improve his behaviour and regulate his response to difficult and confrontational situations. family violence / safety the mother’s only evidence to the court regarding the demise of the relationship between her and the father is that the relationship ended due to the alleged affair the father was having with [ms d]. the mother’s evidence is that she and the father even “worked on” their relationship after finding out about the alleged affair. it is not now up to the mother to allege there were other contributing factors dating back to the start of the relationship as this is inconsistent with her evidence that she wanted to try and make the relationship work even after finding out the father was allegedly having an affair. furthermore, the claims made by the mother and the affidavit of her sister [ms s] were not raised on the previous occasion, again inconsistent with the mother signing orders that were to be taken by the court as in the best interests of the children. the father denies that he has anger management or behavioural issues beyond any ordinary member of society. he is a passionate man who loves his children very much, and who on occasion has allowed frustration with these proceedings to become evident. the mother removing one or both of the children frequently and then engaging in lengthy argumentative communication is a contributing factor to his frustration. the father ceasing communication with the mother over christmas and at times they cannot reach agreement about the next steps is an indication that he actively manages and regulates his reaction and response to the mother. the father does not accept that he engaged in physical family violence towards the mother during the course of their relationship. as he said under cross‑examination in relation to two specific instances of alleged violence at the end of their relationship, he acted in self-defence to diffuse difficult situations and he was not charged with any offences notwithstanding the attendance of police. it is accepted that there were verbal arguments and physical contact during the relationship. whether that physical contact may meet the legal definition of an assault is a matter for police and lawyers, not the father. so much can also be said of whether the father, in the legal sense of the term, breached the family violence order protecting [ms d] – noting his evidence, corroborated by documents in his tender bundle is that he did not – but it is undisputed that the charge was dropped. it is not disputed that the father and mother now have an acrimonious relationship. they separated and are not together for a reason. this was almost ten years ago. these proceedings have caused the father and [ms d] significant stress, whether or not the mother specifically intended to cause this impact on them. with respect, the father’s allegedly negative attitude towards the mother – which in any case is not conceded – is only relevant peripherally to a consideration of what is in the children’s best interests. it is submitted that the father can hold whatever attitude he cares to about the mother so long as it does not adversely affect the children or his parenting of them. annexure “b” of the affidavit of [ms s] shows a text message from the mother to [ms s] relating to an incident where she called an ambulance for [y]. [ms s’s] response that has been cropped states “his just a fuck wit”. this is the opinion of the father the children are being exposed to in the mother’s care and an opinion clearly shared by her family. that it's unreasonable for the father to want to be called at the time of the emergency where he could potentially assist when the mother states she wishes she had someone who could do so. it is always the opinion of the mother that father is acting like a "fuck wit" when he is only trying to be more involved. the children are more exposed to the mother’s opinion of the father in her care than his opinion of the mother when in his. the mother’s descriptions of the father always involve accusatory words and phrases such as “yelled at, accused me of, verbally abused me, attacked” and so on. the mother has never acknowledged that her behaviour is not in the best interests of the children or could be seen by the father and [ms d] as “antagonistic, hurtful, intimidating, threatening and harmful” particularly to their young children. it is [ms d] and [mr mcmaster]’s number one priority to ensure their young children are not being exposed to any harm or stress caused by these proceedings. the father acknowledges and accepts that [in late] 2020 he engaged in an act of family violence towards his current partner [ms d]. the father acknowledges and accepts that [y] was a witness to his actions by hearing the argument. the father acknowledges and accepts that his behaviour in that instance was unacceptable but says that the most serious charges against him did not proceed and that the offending was a one-off, isolated incident in his relationship with [ms d]. this is not to minimise the incident, he has accepted full accountability of his role in the events, has addressed and made changes to his behaviour and addressed this topic with [y] when he returned to his care immediately after his release from [prison] and prior to the mother obtaining orders ceasing all contact. the father does not blame the mother for his actions as submitted by the mother. his evidence during the hearing confirmed the actions of the mother removing [x] from his care, together with a number of other factors, was a major contributing factor. the father submits that the court would not be satisfied that the children are at ongoing risk of family violence from him, or being exposed to family violence perpetrated against others, or otherwise to be put at harm. in the four years since the making of the 11 april 2018 order, the mother can point only to a single instance of family violence, albeit a serious one, in support of her contention. there is no reason why any time he has with either child needs to be supervised. furthermore, the children are both of the age they can have a mobile phone, [x] has had one since she was about 8 years old. this further supports the father’s willingness to encourage and support the relationship with their mother in supporting them making contact with her in accordance with their wishes, or for example, at a time they did not feel safe. the father submits that the court can be further satisfied that [ms d] would act as a protective factor for the children. the evidence as to what occurred [in] may 2022 and the alleged instance of verbal abuse is disputed and it is submitted that the court would not be satisfied that [ms d] intentionally verbally abused the mother. [ms d] supports the father whole-heartedly because the offending towards her was a one-off, isolated incident in a long-standing and loving relationship. the mother’s evidence is that she remained looking down at the floor, yet she also claims to have seen [ms d] pointing at her. [ms d] denies it was intended as verbal abuse, rather a reaction type statement in the hope the mother would consider how it felt for [ms d], or had the roles been reversed how it might feel for the mother. the father submits that given the risk of family violence is minimal, it is unwarranted to mandate his participation in anger management courses. that said, the father indicated at court his preparedness to undertake an appropriate course if that were to be a pre-requisite to see [y]. the father says that the [nn program] is not an appropriate course for him in all of his personal circumstances, as it would necessitate a period of significant absence from his young family and a significant financial expense, when he is the primary day-time carer for his two small children and works minimal hours of an evening. the father remains willing to undertake the course he has put forward in his amended response. notwithstanding the icl’s submissions at [36vii], an online course where the father can take the time he needs without time constraints to understand and consider the course content is vastly preferable for him, rather than an in-person course with multiple attendees where he might fall behind other participants and potentially miss course content. the father also refers to his lack of ability to read and write which is a considerable factor when attending a face to face course. the mother admits to struggling emotionally after the death of her sister yet he is extremely critical and unaccepting of [ms d]'s emotions and actions after losing a child the evening of the disagreement between her and the father the mother criticises [ms d] for leaving the house and leaving her child ([y]) in the house yet there has never been an issue raised in relation to the father's ability to care and protect his children, to look after his children or his ability as a father and parent. the mother took this same course of action during the incident in 2014 with [ms kearney] and set the precedent for [ms d]'s response, yet the mother is highly critical of [ms d] and states that [ms d] somehow endangered [y] by doing so. the mother makes no allegations previously, or in her evidence in this matter that the breakdown of the relationship had anything to do with the alleged 18 years of trauma and family violence the father subjected her to, further noting the mother never once used the panic button installed in the home as part of the home security system installed at the time of purchase of the property and never called police herself. she therefore admits to endangering the children and being unable to care and protect for them (against what she alleges the father committed) the entire course of their lives. the mother demonstrates lack of insight into the damage she is doing to the rest of the family unit being [ms d], [mr mcmaster], [f] and [e] by removing the children and not allowing any contact to occur. [mr mcmaster] has proposed a number of different options throughout the proceedings and they've all been denied by the mother at the final hearing of the fvo relating to the children the magistrates court did not put any protection order in place for the children other than one on a no admission's basis and for a period of 12 months. ordering that father could not contact them or approach them accept in accordance with fcfcoa orders. if there were additional risks to the children the magistrates court would have made orders to that effect, protecting the children of the application from the father alleged threat to kill the father submits that the court should be reluctant to find that he in fact made any threat [in] august 2022. the father denies that he said the phrase in question, and has given a plausible explanation for what occurred and what was overheard. on 6 april 2023 the mother suggested “it is my hope you will consider resolving these orders in the same we were able to with the children. final orders with consent and without admissions to remove the need to spend another lengthy day in court.” this concedes the mother does not hold a genuine concern for her safety or “another lengthy day in court” would not be a deterrent. it is submitted the mother continues to obtain these fvo orders to negatively impact these proceedings. noting, no actions followed the father’s alleged threat. disclosure the alleged failure of the father to disclose material and information in timely fashion does not go directly to what might be in the best interests of the children in these proceedings. insofar as the court does consider that the father could have provided information in a more timely matter, that should be considered in light of the father’s lack of legal knowledge and training. it is submitted that the court will accept that the mother was not ultimately prejudiced in the presentation of her case. the father was instructed by the mother’s law firm, criminal lawyer and magistrates court that nothing would progress with the children’s matter until the criminal matter had finalised. it is therefore submitted by the father that he was unable to provide anything that would have assisted the matter in moving forward whilst the criminal proceeding were still on foot and unresolved. this did not impact the mother’s case as she had sole care of the children and has done so for the twelve months after the completion of the criminal matter. in the specific instance of the father failing to undertake drug and alcohol testing, he submits that the mother’s notice of risk only alleges alcohol intoxication but lacks physical evidence. the mother relies on the email from cyps about the father’s alcohol compliance as a bail condition. evidence has been provided to the court by way of cyps letter stating this was not one of the father’s bail conditions, nor was a bail bond paid. the cyps officer was incorrect and the children’s file has now been updated to reflect this information as confirmed by cyps in the abovementioned letter. the father did provide a clean urine screen in accordance with what he understood to be the order of the court, and in relation to hair testing, he was unable to afford the cost of such testing. the mother’s affidavit filed 2 december 2022 is objected to as the courts orders for filing were clear. nonetheless, if the court accepts the affidavit, it must too accept paragraph 47 where the mother admits to using cannabis, including whilst pregnant with [x]. the mother also makes claims about experiencing symptoms of ptsd, both matters have not been explored by the court in accordance with the best interests of the children and the mother’s ability to cope. furthermore, the mother displays significant paranoia in her evidence which is consistent with the use of cannabis. she makes claims the father stalked her and the children to [town n] whilst she had an sifvo in place, she claims the father was nearby to a café she went to once after court and it has been a consistent theme since the demise of the relationship that the mother seems more concerned about where the father is and what he is doing, than the father is of the mother. the mother has not phoned police on any of the examples she has supplied in evidence of the allegations she makes to the court of the father. in a document filed in the magistrates court [in] april 2023 the mother has indicated she suffers from ptsd however this was not disclosed during these proceedings, nor were any records supplied and the subpoena for her medical records from [suburb c medical centre] was not fulfilled by the practice intra-parental communication as noted above, although there was from time to time difficulties and friction between the mother and the father in giving effect to the 11 april 2018 order, by and large the process set down for shared time was working and working appropriately. the father put forward a number of proposals for the children to spend time with their paternal family over the christmas 2022, including for such time to be supervised by members of his or the mother’s family as she considered appropriate. the mother rejected such proposals out of hand with little in the way of explicit reasons. to the extent that there are issues of intra-parental communication at present, it is submitted those issues run both ways, and are influenced by the father’s not unreasonable frustration with the mother’s active stymying of his relationships with the children. child support / finances the father denies the assertions at [29]-[30] of the mother’s submissions that he has lied to the child support agency. the mother simply does not trust the father and his evidence about the extent of his income post-separation, and erroneously appears to believe that the father has told the child support agency that he receives no income from employment. this is not true - the father has provided an estimate of the income he receives from occasional, night-time employment to the child support agency and this has been accepted by them. the father is paying child support as and when it falls due by virtue of a garnishee order directly from his bank account. he has no control over the amounts that are taken from him. the inconsistency in the father’s evidence alleged by the mother in her submissions at [40] simply does not exist. accordingly, there is no basis for the order sought by the mother, at [32] of her submissions, for leave to provide to services australia the material filed by the father. failing that, if the court is not willing to reject this out of hand, it is submitted that the seeking of such an order should not be done by way of submissions but by formal application, evidence and argument. further, it is incorrect to say (as the mother does at [40] of her submissions) that the funds for the setting up of the father’s business came from the property settlement with the mother. in fact, the settlement by the mother came from her superannuation fund and was transferred directly into the father’s superannuation fund – no cash amount was transferred. furthmore [mr mcmaster] and [ms d] were both employed full time at [hh company] at the time of the purchase of the [vehicle] for [ms d]'s start up business. the father remained employed with [hh company] and [jj company] until well into the follow year when the covid 19 pandemic occurred. insofar as the mother suggests that the business was set up in [ms d]'s name so as to defeat claims for child support etc. (see [40 of her submissions) that is absolutely denied. the father gave evidence and was cross-examined on this point, and his evidence remained unshaken that after the interim family violence order was made, it became difficult for him to remain working actively in the business and to remain on the books as an operator of the business, particularly in light of the business receiving work through [city b authorities] and needing to attend sensitive sites. this evidence by the father has not been refuted. the father provides the enclosed timeline for the mother and the court’s reference. the mother is struggling financially by her own admissions to the court that she could no longer pay for a final trial, despite being [away] at the time of the section 102na grant. the father would better fulfil his financial obligations and support if the children were returned to his care and he was able to provide for them in the manner he previously was, therefore lowering any child support obligations that he is now paying off at minimal amount and assisting the mother with splitting all the costs associated with the children meaningful relationship the children are entitled to a meaningful relationship with their father and enjoy their time with him, also with their half-brother and half-sister whom they have only met once or twice. to the extent that [x] has from time to time in the past expressed a desire not to see her father, the mother herself has acknowledged that x] will play her parents off against each other on occasion. certainly, [x] indicated to the family report writer in september 2022 that she wishes to spend time with her father and is worried she will not see him again. [y] in particular seeks a return to the week about arrangements. the court should give full weight to the childrens’ views expressed in the family report. [y] in particular is coming to an age where it is important that he have male role models in his life and understand his place in his family constellation. there is evidence before the court that demonstrates [y] is demonstrating behavioural issues at school in the mother’s care. it can only be of benefit to [y] to have the father play an active role in his life. as the icl notes at [32] of her submissions, notwithstanding the lack of contact with their father, both [x] and [y] displayed comfort and rapport with the father in the family report interview. at [kk event] this year, [x] and [y] sought out the father and [ms d] on multiple occasions, including running across a road unprompted to see their father. it was entirely coincidental that the father and [ms d] were at the event at the same time as the children and the mother. the children clearly want the father in their lives. accordingly, there seems little basis to support the mother’s submission that any transition in increasing time needs to be slow so as to “re-establish” the relationship, or that supervised time is always required. this is supported by their wishes expressed as recently as september 2022 and january 2023. the father’s attempts at contact with the children have been significantly inhibited by the mother. since [late] 2020, [y] and [x] have been denied the opportunity by the mother’s actions to have a meaningful relationship with their father. it was not until may 2022 when the mother permitted zoom contact and only because there were orders put in place requiring this. spending time with the children at christmas in 2022 had to be on the mother’s terms or not occur at all, and the mother did not make any allowances for the father’s other commitments nor engage meaningfully with his proposals. with respect to the mother’s submissions at [24], the alleged factors set out therein do not go to what is in the best interests of the children and certainly do not prove in and of themselves that equal time is inappropriate. the mother’s proposal that a gradual return to care for the children only further supports her desire for complete parental alienation of the father. any delay in returning the children to adequate meaningful time with the father whilst they have displayed evidence that they are still very deeply connected and willing to spend time with him, could result in the children’s relationship being damaged, whilst at this stage is still in good tact. in january 2023 the mother instructed the children to go and speak with the father whilst she supervised from across the street without the conversation being monitored, conceding that she really doesn't have concerns about what the father says to them and further demonstrating to the court again, that the mother is willing to breach any orders that are made. the mother submits that she wants the children to have a relationship with their father but states her only consideration is their safety, a topic which has not been raised by her prior to 2020 and all attempts by the father to negotiate meaningful time with the children have been denied. the mother’s proposed orders seek to remove the wishes and choices of the children, [x] in particular. the icl submits that at the time of the incident between the father and [ms d], [x] was not in the home as a result of refusing to return to the father’s care which is incorrect. the mother attempted to return [x] to the father’s care a number of times over the following days but the father sought not to engage in any further disruption to the family unit or any further antagonising from the mother. the icl orders propose that if the father was to do the nominated testing and enrol in the nominated behavioural change program, that the children could begin staying with the father as soon as within 6 months. this is supportive of the father and identifies that the risk to the children is minimal. capacity to meet needs the father has given evidence that when the children are in his care, their care has a clear focus on family time with the family unit, learning-based activities, sibling activities, routine, clear boundaries and a long and established relationship with extended family and friends who support positive relationships and interactions in blended families. accordingly, he has the capacity to meet their needs when they are in his care. [ms d]’s family are still extensively engaged with their family unit and spending time with the children of her and the fathers. travel the father holds concerns in relation to the mother absconding with the children and as such does not support international travel for the children or the obtaining of passports, nor relocation outside of the [city b] region. this is supported by the mother’s rash proposal in her initiating application to relocate the children to [town n] only to change her mind a short time later after the breakdown in another relationship. drug testing in relation to drug and alcohol testing and the orders proposed by the mother and icl, the father submits: the mother has put forward no evidence that the father has an issue with illicit drug use, the father has provided a negative urine screen for illicit drugs, in compliance with court orders, the mother has put forward no evidence that the father is a chronic excessive consumer of alcohol – her case at its highest is that the father has issues with occasional alcohol binges, and the making of such an order as sought is unfair in circumstances where: hair testing can only demonstrate abstinence versus chronic excessive alcohol use, and isn’t reliable in respect of occasional drinking events,1 the icl is only seeking an order (24) which would restrict a parent’s consumption of alcohol above the legal driving limit when having care of the children, and the mother herself consumes alcohol in the presence of the children. the father has given evidence that he has been subjected to multiple roadside alcohol tests and has not returned a positive result. in the event that the court is minded to make an order for the father to undergo such testing, which is not conceded, the father submits that the order should be more specific than requiring the father to return a result showing “no excessive alcohol use”. international guidelines suggest that a concentration of ethyl glucuronide greater than or equal to 30 pg/mg strongly suggests chronic excessive alcohol consumption,2 and this should be expressly referenced in the order. the mother’s most recent orders sought state “on the condition that the father’s hair follicle test in negative for alcohol and illicit substances, the father shall spend time with [y] as follows” this order now seeks a negative result which is inconsistent with the type of testing they seek. furthermore, one of the mother’s previous proposed minute of orders, sought to have the father undertake hair follicle testing but had no order for which to rely on the outcome of that testing. it is submitted this is a step the mother is seeking as the father will be financially unable to undertake this. as the mother has admitted to using illicit substances in her affidavit as referred to above, the court should consider making the same order for the mother given then children have been in her sole care and she displays evidence consistent with illicit drug use conclusion the father says that the best interests of the children are met with orders in the terms of his amended response filed during the course of the hearing and in accordance with the wishes expressed by the children the father’s position to walk away if he does not get appropriate meaningful time with the children are only as a result of being back into a corner and forced to choose between the two younger children and the two children of these proceedings the father and [ms d] live in a [large house], each child has still has it’s own space and given [x]’s age, she has her own bathroom. there would be no issue the children returning to overnight care at the father and [ms d]’s home
submissions of the independent children’s lawyer
background the parties agreed during the proceedings that given her age [x] would spend time with her father in accordance with her wishes and it was noted that this time would occur when [y] was spending time with his father. the issues in dispute therefore remained parental responsibility and how [y] would spend time with his father. orders sought. in summary, the applicant mother sought that she has sole parental responsibility for the children, that the children live with her, that the father enroll in the [nn program], an anger management course and provide hair follicle testing for illicit substance use and alcohol use. additional orders seeking restraints on the father were also sought. the mother proposed that the father commence spending time with [y] supervised at a contact centre and would increase on the father’s compliance with the orders to complete the behavioral change and anger management courses and provide clear hft test results. all parties agreed that the [nn program] required participation for the 30 weeks of the course and required the father to attend in sessions in person. the respondent father sought that the parents have equal shared parental responsibility for the children and that the father complete an anger management course. upon completion of this course he proposed that [y] spend time with him from 3pm friday until 9am tuesday each week for five weeks and then a shared care week about arrangement. the father also sought orders seeking restraints on both parents. the father’s proposed anger management course was a five week online course. his oral evidence was that he could not comply with the mother’s proposed course as he could not commit to the time away from his younger children or to the expense of attending the course. at the commencement of the final hearing the father had not attended for the hft pursuant to the current orders in place as he stated he could not afford to do so. the icl sought orders in line with the orders proposed by the mother but proposed that [y] spend increasing time with his father while the father was enrolled in the [nn program] rather than waiting for it to conclude in its entirety given the length of the course. position of the parties. the matter was listed for final hearing on 8 and 9 december 2022 and went part heard. the matter was listed on 3 february 2023 and all evidence concluded on that date. at the commencement of the proceedings the mother’s position had not changed and remained her position throughout the proceedings. at the commencement of the proceedings the father’s position was that the children lived with him and spend the weekend with the mother each week for a period of 12 months. he then stated that if the court did not make orders for 50/50 shared care he would walk away and not spend anytime with the children. he subsequently changed his position in that he would accept an arrangement where the children spent gradually increasing time with him and increasing to the 50/50 shared care arrangement after approximately a few months. this appeared to remain his position at the commencement of proceedings on 3 february 2023. at the conclusion of the father’s case the position of the father was that he would accept the decision of the court. the father declined to participate in any further cross examination on 3 february 2023 and left the court room. considering the events of 3 february 2023 the icl now seeks orders as per the amended minute of order as attached to these submissions. parental responsibility. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is rebutted if the court can be satisfied that there is evidence that a parent has engaged in family violence or, the presumption is not in the best interests of the child. there is a current avo in place for the protection of the mother. the mother provides evidence of numerous incidents of family violence throughout the relationship in her trial affidavit filed 21/11/2022 as does the father in his trial affidavit filed 22/22/2022. the father was cross examined in particular on two incidents where he removed the mother from the home during arguments. his evidence was that he punched the wall near the mother’s head on one occasion and on both occasions put her over his shoulder and put her outside the home and locked her out to diffuse the situation. the father did not view this behaviour as assault, partly because when the police attended the home they did not charge him on those occasions. all parties acknowledge that a serious incident occurred [in late] 2020 between [ms d], the father’s partner, and the father when [y] was present in the home. the father’s evidence of events is contained in 3 paragraphs in his trial affidavit and maintains that [y] did not witness the incident and remained asleep. the father told the family consultant that the entire proceedings were based on this incident. he stated that he had consumed a couple of drinks on the night. the evidence of [ms d] in her trail affidavit is that this was an isolated incident, but it caused her to leave the home and call her mother. subsequently the police attended the property and arrested the father. the statement made by [y] to the police about this incident makes it quite clear that [y] was well aware of what was happening, opened the door to the police and was scared during the entire event. the mother’s evidence is that she was unaware that this incident had occurred until contacted by child protection and that [y] remained traumatised for some time after this event. neither the father nor [ms d] advised the mother of what had occurred. the police incident reports of that night do not support the father’s version of events either as contained in his affidavit or as stated to the family consultant. the police incident reports clearly show that this was a very traumatic incident for [y] to have witnessed. on 26/8/2022 [ms p], the solicitor acting for the father at the time, disclosed that she heard the father make a threat during a telephone conversation she had with him. she stated that she heard the father say “fuck the system, kill the bitch.” under cross examination [ms p] confirmed that she recognised the father’s voice as saying these words. the father has denied saying these words. he subsequently advised the court that it was not him but another person in the room who said the phrase. he failed to identify who that person was. due to the history of the matter the mother states that communication between the parties is difficult. the father disagrees. the mother gives evidence that she was verbally abused by [ms d] at [city b] magistrates court which was witnessed by her solicitor. the children have been in the full time care of their mother since [late] 2020. there have been 2 supervised zoom calls between the children and the father pursuant to orders dated 24/5/2022. other than this time the children have spent no time with the father apart from attending the family report interviews on 25 august 2022. the father has stated that if the court does not make the orders he is seeking he will simply walk away and wait until the children reach the age of 18 years to resume his relationship with them. it is submitted that this demonstrates a remarkable lack of insight by the father as to the impact this decision will have on his children and a naïve belief that his relationship with [y] and [x] will simply pick up where it left off if the children have no time with him until they reach age 18 years. the father did concede that severing the relationship with [y] and [x] would be traumatic for them but concluded that it was better to have two traumatized children than four. it is submitted that considering points 15-28 above the court can be satisfied that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not in the best interests of the children given the communication difficulties between the parents and the father’s failure to spend time with the children as per the current orders. it is submitted that the court may find also that he children have been exposed to family violence by the father. in the circumstances the icl submits that the most appropriate person to hold parental responsibility for the children is the mother and supports the mother’s proposed order for sole parental responsibility. spend time with. both [x] and [y] have expressed to the icl that they wish to spend time with their father and they clearly miss him. [x] specifically told the family consultant that she was worried that she would not see her dad again. if the children do not spend time with their father and [ms d] they also miss out on spending time with their younger half brothers. both children appear to have a good relationship with their brothers will [x] stating that she would like to spend more time with them. despite not having spent time with their father for a considerable amount of time the family consultant noted that both children were comfortable in an observation session with the father, [ms d] and the younger children at the time of the family report interviews. it is submitted that it is in the best interests of both [x] and [y] that they spend time with their father, including [ms d] and the younger children. however there are a number of concerning issues regarding the ability of both the father and [ms d] to understand the impact of their behaviour on [x] and [y] and the ability of both the father and [ms d] to protect the children from conflict and family violence. these concerns include, the father’s lack of understanding that putting the mother over his shoulder and putting her outside the home amounted to an assault which he admitted to doing on 2 occasions. the minimizing by both the father and [ms d] of the incident in the father’s home [in late] 2020 and what [y] experienced that night as well as the father’s lack of remorse for his behaviour. the conflicting evidence of the father and the police reports of the [late] 2020 incidents. the family consultant’s view that the father has made no attempt to address either his anger or emotional regulation issues or consider the impact of his behaviour on the children. the father’s inability to take responsibility for his behaviour rather seeking to blame others, including the mother, for the circumstances he finds himself in. [ms d]’s support of the father, including his behaviour, despite the events of [late] 2020 and the resumption of the relationship shortly after this incident. the father’s proposal of an online anger management course notwithstanding that he gave evidence that he find it difficult to read documents and has difficulty in understanding complicated documents. it is submitted that the father not only needs to address his anger management issues but requires assistance to fundamentally change his behaviour and his response to situations that he finds challenging. an example of the father’s inability to cope with situations or regulate his emotions in situations that he finds challenging was of the father effectively finishing his case by leaving the witness box and declining to participate in any further cross examination at the commencement of proceedings on 3 february 2023. it is submitted that the father’s proposed anger management course is manifestly inadequate to address the issues raised and the court would have concerns as to the father’s understanding of what is required and his ability to accept that his behaviour is problematic for the children. it is submitted that unless the father engages in services to assist him with his behaviour the court cannot be satisfied that incidents such as that which occurred [in late] 2020 will not be repeated and that the children will not be exposed to further family violence. it is submitted that given the whole hearted support of the father by [ms d], despite having been assaulted by him, the court cannot be satisfied that [ms d] can act protectively if needed. she acknowledges in her affidavit of 24/11/2022 that she left [y] in the home when she left [in late] 2020. it is noted that [e], the child of [ms d] and the father, was not at the home that night. due to the father effectively finishing his case without completing his oral evidence the icl did not have the opportunity to ask [ms d] if her response would have been different if [e] had been present. it is submitted that it is in the best interests of [y], and [x] if she wishes to attend, that the children spend time with their father pursuant to proposed orders of the icl provided in this matter. it is submitted that the proposed orders of the icl provide for [y] and [x] to spend time with their father, as they have expressed that they wished to do, but also ensuring their safety. it is a matter for the father if he chooses not to engage with his children if he does not agree with the orders that his honour determines are in the best interests of [y] and [x].
submissions on behalf of the applicant in reply
outline these submissions are provided in accordance with the orders of judge neville made on 3 february 2023. it is noted that those orders provide that the submissions in reply should be limited to 2 pages. leave is sought for these submissions to be longer than this limit. the orders permitted the father to file submissions of 6 pages. his submissions (filed on 14 april 2023 – hereafter “the father’s submissions”) are in fact about 11 pages. in addition, those submissions introduce a number of new asserted facts and evidence and deal with issues not otherwise addressed in the mother’s submissions. the issues to be addressed in these submissions in reply are as follows:- the nature of the proceedings as a result of the father refusing to complete his cross examination, the new asserted facts and evidence included in the father’s submissions, the need for the father to undertake the course proposed by the icl and the mother, the need for alcohol testing, specific responses to other paragraphs. nature of proceedings the impact of the father’s actions on 3 february 2023 are addressed in the mother’s submissions at paragraphs 5 – 8. the orders made on 3 february 2023 identify that the matter was to proceed “essentially on an undefended basis”. the nature of the proceedings was discussed at length on that date. any course other than proceeding on an undefended basis would be procedurally unfair to the mother. she willingly participated in the proceedings as required and submitted herself to cross examination for as long as was required. the father failed to do the latter. the consequences of the matter being undefended are also set out in the mother’s submissions. given the prejudicial end to the father’s cross examination, the mother was permitted to rely on further documents that had not yet been the subject of cross examination. on that basis some further documents were tendered. the father has sought that further documents be permitted to be tendered by him. none of those documents were the subject of cross examination of the mother. no further documents should be able to be tendered by the father. it is noted that the mother was not cross examined about a number of issues raised in her affidavit material. importantly, this included the allegations that she makes regarding the father’s behaviour during the relationship and subsequently. the court took the time on 3 february 2023 to discuss with the father the consequences of his actions. the matter was stood down to enable the father’s lawyers to give him advice about these matters. it is not now open to the father to deny the consequences of his actions as they were explained to him. it is noted that the court permitted the father’s partner [ms d] to address the court briefly on 3 february 2023. although she did this from the witness box, her statements were not evidence and no cross examination occurred. to the extent that her statements included assertions of evidence, they should be excluded from consideration. her statements have the status only of submissions. asserted new facts and evidence throughout his submissions, the father has included new facts and evidence that have not been put into evidence. the father should not be permitted to rely on new facts and evidence in circumstances where the evidence has closed, and the matter is subject to submissions only. this is particularly important in circumstances where the father has refused to participate in the trial as required and the mother was not able to complete cross examination of the father. in any event, once a trial is over a party is only able to rely on new evidence with leave of the court. no leave has been sought. in any event, leave should not be granted in the circumstances of the matter proceeding as an undefended hearing. examples of additional evidence referred to by the father in his submissions and which should not be admitted into evidence by the court include, but are not limited to, paragraph 37 (references to panic buttons), paragraph 46 (evidence before the magistrates court), paragraph 52 and the attached “timeline” regarding child support and paragraph 69 regarding hair follicle testing. there are a number of other items of asserted new evidence included in the father’s submissions. the distinction between submission and asserted evidence is often blurred. need for [nn program] the icl and the mother seek orders for the father to undertake the intensive course [nn program]. the father proposes, as an alternative, a course that can be entirely undertaken online. the mother and the icl appear to be ad idem that the father’s inability to control his behaviour is a serious concern and needs to be addressed to minimise the risks to the children for the future. the father has an admitted deficiency in his literacy skills. for an online course, the court could not even be satisfied that the father himself had completed the course. in addition, the court could not be satisfied that the father completed the course by himself and without the assistance of his partner. the [nn program] is face-to-face. there can be no dispute about the father actually completing the course if he is required to personally attend the course. there could also be no dispute that the father undertook the course personally and without the assistance of his partner. the father has raised in his submissions, for the first time, that his deficiency in literacy skills may have an impact on his ability to complete this course. with respect, it would be surprising if the course organisers were not able to accommodate a person’s level of literacy. no such accommodation could occur, in any event, with an online course. the father would be reliant upon his partner to assist him. this would lead to the concern referred to above that it was not in fact the father who was completing the course or that he was completing it with his father. there is no evidence that the commitment to the course would require more than 1 – 2 hours per week. need for alcohol testing after hearing a contested interim application by the mother, the court made orders on 24 may 2022 that required the father to undergo hair follicle testing “as set out in the mother’s orders.” (order 6). the relevant orders sought by the mother were set out in a minute of orders filed on 6 may 2022. at paragraph 9 of those proposed orders were the orders sought by the mother about testing. the proposed testing clearly included alcohol. the father provided a private drug test on 31 may 2022 which did not comply with the earlier order. as a result, further orders were made on 2 august 2022 requiring the father to immediately undertake a hair follicle test covering drug and alcohol usage over the previous 6 months. the test was required to be provided to the court by no later than 23 august 2022. notwithstanding this order, the father did not undertake a test or, if he did, he did not provide the results to the court or the mother. as a result of the father’s failure to undertake the tests as ordered, the court can infer that the father’s alcohol consumption is a concern. each of the various incidents involving the father behaving inappropriately and engaging in family violence have invariably included a level of intoxication of the father. the court would accept that there is a concern about the father’s level of alcohol consumption. as a result of his unwillingness or refusal to obtain appropriate evidence about his alcohol consumption, the court can infer that it remains a serious concern. the court should make orders for testing regarding the father’s alcohol consumption. specific responses to other paragraphs paragraph 8 – the fact that [ms d] was not at the house at the time of the breach of the then existing fvo is not relevant. the order prohibited the father from being at the property. it is this that constituted the breach of the order. paragraph 10 – the parties do not agree that the equal time arrangement was “working satisfactorily”. indeed, the father himself complains about the fact that the children had not been returned to him on more than one occasion. the father accepted in cross examination that [x] told the police [in late] 2020 that she did not want to return to her father’s care. similar comments about the equal time arrangement are made elsewhere in the father’s submissions. paragraph 17 – there is no evidence that the mother holds the view about “ownership” of the children asserted. the mother was not cross-examined about this topic. the issue of the christmas arrangements for the children to spend time with their father is addressed in the mother’s submissions. the mother agreed to time occurring but, because it was not a complete acceptance of the father’s proposed time, he chose not to spend any time with the children. this reflects poorly on the father and not on the mother. paragraph 18 – this paragraph is extraordinary. it effectively blames the mother for taking action to protect the children as a result of a serious family violence incident that occurred in the father’s household and for which he spent time in custody, with bail refused. cyps records are before the court and they support the proposition that that agency would have likely taken action to remove the children from their father’s care, if the mother did not take her own action. when the matter came before the court, the court also accepted a serious issue was raised and suspended all time between the children and their father. that is, having come to a conclusion that there were concerns about the children in their father’s care as a result of the incidents which she became aware of, the court approved her actions and suspended time. in relation to the mother’s alleged breach of orders prior to the parenting orders being suspended, these matters were properly before the court and were able to be cross examined about if required. the father was certainly cross-examined about those incidents and agreed that [x] or both children were distressed and refusing to return to his care. paragraph 27 – it is an agreed fact that the parties have an “acrimonious relationship.” this strongly points towards an order for sole parental responsibility to the mother. in this paragraph the father, effectively, blames the mother for the stress caused to himself and [ms d] by these proceedings. this again shows a complete lack of insight by the father as to the reasons why these proceedings were necessary. the father then suggests that even if he holds strong negative views about the mother, which he does not concede, that those are not relevant to the best interests of children. the court would be significantly concerned about the father, or his partner, sharing their views of the mother with the children once they have unsupervised time. paragraph 28 – a comment by the mother’s sister in a text message exchange between the two, does not prove that the children are exposed to any negative opinion that the mother may have of the father or his partner. the mother was not cross-examined to suggest either that she has significant negative opinions about them or, more importantly, that she in any way allows her views to be exposed to the children. paragraph 29 – the father objects to the use of words that he describes as “accusatory”. the mother uses descriptive words to describe the father’s actions or words. the father then complains that the mother has not acknowledged her inappropriate behaviour and the likely adverse impact her behaviour has had on the father, his partner and their children. the mother’s actions that are complained about are bringing and prosecuting these proceedings. the mother has done nothing to expose the father and [ms d]’s children to any harm or stress. paragraph 30 – although he purports to acknowledge the incident on [in late] 2020, it is noted that the father’s version of events set out in his affidavit was a significantly watered-down version of the events that actually happened. if the incident had occurred only as described by him in his affidavit material, then the subsequent charges of assault and damage property could not have been founded. the court should accept that the incidents occurred as set out in the unredacted versions of the incidents tendered to the court. paragraph 31 – although the father says that he does not blame the mother for his actions, he nonetheless asserts that her actions in relation to [x] were a “major contributing factor.” in any event, the father has shown a negative attitude towards the mother, including the blame he attributes to her, in a number of other contexts as set out in the mother’s submissions. paragraph 33 – the court could not accept that [ms d] would be a protective factor for the children. the explanation of the mother’s additional tender documents includes reference to various cyps records where [ms d] has made it clear that she would not call the authorities in the event of a further incident between her and the father. it is also clear from the mother’s evidence that [ms d] holds significant negative attitudes towards the mother. in the 2nd part of this paragraph, there appears to be an acceptance that [ms d] did in fact engage inappropriately with the mother in the court room at the magistrates court on [in] may 2022. paragraph 35 – there is no criticism of [ms d] in relation to the incident [in] september 2020 other than that she blames the mother for the incident, at least partly. [ms d] was the victim on this occasion. there certainly is no criticism of [ms d] at being distressed after an apparent miscarriage. paragraph 36 – both the father and [ms d] exposed [y] to family violence and left him in the care of the perpetrator of that violence. [ms d] is not to blame, however, for that fact, given that she is not the biological parent of [y] and likely could not have insisted on [y] being in her care. paragraph 37 – the last sentence of this paragraph is another extraordinary submission. effectively the submission is that, if the mother is truthful in that she was a victim of family violence, then she behaved inappropriately and endangered the children by not calling the police or using a panic button. this is a remarkable example of victim blaming. it is not surprising that counsel for the father did not cross-examine the mother to suggest this. no doubt she would have been complying with her obligations under the barristers rules not to be the mere mouthpiece of the client. paragraph 38 – the mother has taken action to protect the children from the risk of exposure to family violence in the household of the father. that is her focus and appropriately so. there is no basis for a finding to be made critical of the mother about her taking those steps, notwithstanding any incidental impact this may have had on others in the father’s family. paragraph 39 - these orders were settled by consent and without admissions. this is a usual way in which fvo proceedings are resolved. the magistrate or the magistrates court would not otherwise have had a position on which orders should be made. paragraph 41 – this paragraph is about a settlement offer by the mother in fvo proceedings. the evidence is both inadmissible negotiations and not otherwise in evidence anyway. nonetheless, the proposal by the mother was entirely appropriate. it was a common-sense approach, that unfortunately the father did not share, to resolve those proceedings. paragraph 45 – the mother’s affidavit filed on 2 december 2022 has already been admitted into evidence without demur by the father’s counsel. the father comments in this paragraph are unsupported by the evidence, including a fantastical claim about paranoia possibly being caused by cannabis usage. there is no evidence that the mother has any issues in relation to her care of the children and, in particular, that she has a problem with alcohol or drug consumption. the mother was not cross examined on this issue, and the father’s affidavit evidence on this issue lacked particularity of any sort other than a general ‘concern’. the suggestion in paragraph 70 that the mother should be required to undertake drug testing is not justified on the evidence. if any evidence was available during the proceedings to allege illicit drug use by the mother, then that should have been brought to the attention of the court and appropriate interim orders for testing sought or obtained. none of this occurred. paragraph 49 – at paragraph 29 of the mother’s submissions, are set out the various lies told to the child support agency by the father. those lies are particularly egregious. in addition, there is a dispute about whether or not the father properly discloses his income to the agency. there is a dispute about whether there is an inconsistency in the father’s evidence about his income and employment. this court does not need to decide that point. what the mother seeks is that she be at liberty to provide to the child support agency documents from these proceedings so that the agency can make determinations on this issue. paragraph 53 – the father’s comments about the mother’s financial circumstances are irrelevant and petty. both parties were in receipt of funding as a result of section 102na. the 2nd sentence of the paragraph implicitly says that the father will provide more financial support for the children but only if he gets the outcome that he desires. paragraph 57 – it is noted that [y] was a witness in the father’s criminal proceedings until the father pleaded guilty in [early] 2022. in any event, the court had suspended the children’s time with the father. the father, again, blames the mother despite the endorsement of the court of the approach proposed by her. paragraph 60 – the mother agrees that this event occurred. she was, effectively, supervising the children’s time with their father, albeit from across the road. paragraph 63 – the father was cross-examined about [x]’s refusal to return to his care and he agreed that this was the case. paragraph 64 – the submission that the icl has accepted that the risk is minimal for the children to spend time with their father is not reflective of her submissions. both the mother and the icl are attempting to manage and reduce the risk by insisting on the completion of the course and drug testing. paragraph 66 – there is no basis in the evidence for the father’s submissions about proposed international travel. the mother was not cross-examined about this topic either. the father’s “concerns” are not evidence. there is no basis not to make orders as sought by the mother about international travel. the father was cross-examined extensively about his attitudes to international travel. he had previously filed submissions where he attempted to mislead the court about this topic. for example, he asserted that he “had to” list the children on the “flight risk list”. this related to a personal trip for the mother that she undertook to [country ll] in 2019. despite [x] not having a passport, the father asserted that there was a risk that the mother was going to take the child to [country ll]. there was no rational basis for the father’s belief. there is also no rational basis for any assertion that the mother is a “flight risk” if she were permitted to travel internationally with the children. the court should have regard to section 60cc(3)(l), as it is highly probable that absent the mother’s proposed orders being made, the father will not consent to the children travelling internationally with the mother and the court will be called upon to determine this issue in future. paragraph 72 – there is no rational basis that the father or his partner could conclude that he has been backed into a corner and is being forced to make a choice between the children the subject of these proceedings and his two children with [ms d]. the mother is proposing reasonable time for the children to spend with their father, subject to conditions set out in her proposed orders. if those orders were made, then [x] and [y] would be able to enjoy the time with their father and with his partner and their half-siblings. it is only the father and his partner who see that outcome as somehow being detrimental to all involved and requiring the drastic and extraordinary step of cutting off time with [x] and [y]. summary the court should make orders in accordance with the orders proposed by the mother and, in almost all respects, supported by the icl. the father’s lack of insight continues in the form of the submissions that he has filed. the court would be concerned about the continued references to the mother as being to blame for bringing these proceedings and for being at least partly to blame for the father’s own actions, which constituted family violence towards his current partner. his comments to the child support agency take the level of blame to a significantly higher level and clearly constitute deliberate lies by the father to that agency. the children should have a relationship with their father. the mother supports that occurring. however, the father’s inability to control his behaviour and his likely excessive consumption of alcohol mean that the court should move cautiously and require the father to undergo hair follicle testing for alcohol consumption and participate in the intensive [nn program] to manage and hopefully minimise the risk.
outline of principle
on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.” on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.   the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(2))  ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s.60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues:
the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility.  ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words “meaningful involvement”. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting:
the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements.  ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]–[199]):  6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) — (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than “1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays” or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve “both” parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children.  ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system”. “meaning” is defined as “having intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)”. a second definition is “conveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive”. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines “meaning” (in generalised use) as “significance”. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as “full of meaning, significant”. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as “expressive or significant: a meaning look”. [26] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
i am conscious that a long-distance relationship, with longer but less frequent times spent together, is inevitably different from a relationship where people live closer together with regular face-to-face contact. but it does not itself mean it cannot be meaningful.
we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o’ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]:
the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a “meaningful relationship” with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court’s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child’s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider “the benefit to the child” of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j’s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original)
the full court also observed at [191]: “the first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression ‘meaningful relationship’ is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a ‘meaningful relationship’ ”.  7] for our part, we echo the view expressed by the trial judge of the serious nature of depriving the father of contact in circumstances where that appears to have been engineered by the mother, without any fault on the part of the father at all. this cannot be in a child's best interests. [178] it also does not appear to us to be appropriate for a parent to be able to manipulate the family law system to such an extent that the other parent's hope of ever seeing the child again, rests upon the possibility that she may wish to seek him out in later adolescence or adulthood. [179] we think that a family court would not be doing its duty if it were to simply give in to these sorts of considerations, except in the most extreme case and only then, when a positive determination is made that the welfare of the child requires it.
given the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the court must consider the conduct of the parents, not with a view to rewarding one or punishing the other, but to ascertain from such conduct whether the welfare of the child will be better served in the custody of one or the other.
44. this was ultimately a trial concerning the welfare of a child. the court was obliged to pay consideration to the material before it, hear argument if any was proffered and proceed on that material to make orders that met the statutory criteria laid out in part vii of the family law act 1975. 45. the rules of natural justice provide that a party is entitled to be made aware of the date when the trial will be heard and what is being sought at that trial. the family law rules 2004 provide in rule 15.04 that an affidavit may be relied on at a hearing or trial only if it is filed and served in accordance with the rules or an order. rule 15.07 requires affidavits to be filed 14 days before a pre-trial conference. rule 15.14 provides that a party who wishes to cross-examine a deponent must at least 14 days before the trial give to the party who filed the affidavit a written notice stating the name of the deponent who is required to attend for cross-examination. 46. whilst the court has power to vary times and dispense with compliance of the rules, ultimately such a process should be adopted where the dictates of justice make it appropriate. the non-appearance of a party at the hearing places the judge in a difficult position when indulgences are sought by the other party to rely upon material not served in accordance with the rules or to otherwise seek some waiver of the rules. 47. the party who appears is entitled to expect that the proceedings will be dealt with on the day they are fixed for trial.... in buljubasic v buljubasic [1999] famca 474, (1999) flc 92-865, 25 fam lr 371 at para 26 lindenmayer j, with whom finn and warnick jj agreed said:
"the business of the court would come to an end if people could simply stay away from the court on the listed date for hearing and be assured that their matter would not proceed in their absence, and effectively obtain an adjournment, without merit, merely because the court felt constrained not to proceed with the matter in their absence."
48. this expectation that the proceedings will go on in the absence of a party who chooses not to attend does not relieve the court from its obligation to provide procedural fairness to the absent party.  0] the trial judge also quoted from the decision of abbott and abbott [1995] famca 5, (1995) flc 92-582 (fogarty, baker and kay jj), where the full court considered the nature of an undefended proceeding, at 81,774:
it appears to us that a proceeding will be treated as “undefended” where the respondent does not challenge or put in issue any of the components of the cause of action in question. the fact that the respondent is opposed to the court making the order in question and/or wishes to defend the granting of the order which is sought does not make the proceedings defended if the issues raised by the respondent are irrelevant to the issues constituting the cause of action.  1] in that decision, the full court also cited the decision of lanceley and lanceley [1994] famca 94, (1994) flc 92-491 (barblett dcj, frederico and lindenmayer jj). in that case, their honours considered the nature of an undefended hearing, and concluded at 81,104:
unlike some other jurisdictions, such a circumstance does not and cannot lead, in this court, to a “judgment by default” in favour of the applicant, because the court must still decide, on the evidence before it, that the applicant is entitled, in law, to the relief claimed and that, in the exercise of its discretion, it is appropriate to grant that relief. nevertheless, the proceedings in such a case are clearly “undefended”, and it would be a misuse of language to describe them otherwise. they certainly could not be described as “defended”.
