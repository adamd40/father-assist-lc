reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
on 19 january 2023, my solicitors were served with the husband’s initating application by the husband’s solicitors. the first return hearing was listed for 2 february 2023.[7]
these documents were to be filed on or before 20 february 2023.
after the hearing on 2 february 2023 my solicitors commenced taking detailed instructions for the purpose of preparing and filing my responding documents in line with the terms of the consent order negotiated between senior counsel.
we are writing to formally propose that there be a meeting between the parties on 24 february 2023, in order to discuss resolution of the various matters that have arisen. we are instructed that respective senior counsel have discussed this suggestion. the meeting would proceed upon the basis that our respective senior counsel will be present in melbourne for the purpose of the meeting, and that all other parties will be present here in adelaide. would you please confirm your client’s instructions to attend such meeting.[13]
we are seeking instructions today for a mediation on 6 march on all issues but with priority to resolving parenting first and with your client meeting our client’s costs and the [sic] [mr f’s] fee.[14]
on 1 march 2023, the husband discontinued his initiating application and his divorce application without notice to me.[18]
she further deposes that she was put to considerable cost as a result of having to prepare the various documents required of her by the orders of 2 february 2023.
case management considerations
...the adversarial system has been qualified by changing practices in the courts directed to the reduction of costs and delay and the realisation that the courts are concerned not only with justice between the parties, which remains their priority, but also with the public interest in the proper and efficient use of public resources.[26]
in exercising the discretion to award costs in a civil proceeding, the federal circuit and family court of australia (division 2) or a judge must take account of any failure to comply with the duty imposed by subsection (1) or (2).
the legal principles applicable to costs
a proceeding in a court, whether between parties or not, and includes cross-proceedings or an incidental proceeding in the course of or in connexion with a proceedings.
section 117 confers upon the court a broad discretion in relation to costs. that discretion is one which the court should not seek to fetter. as was pointed out by the high court in penfold v penfold:
it is an accurate description of s 117(1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the subsection is not paramount to s 117(2). as subs (1) is expressed to be subject to subs (2), the former must yield whenever a judge finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. subsection (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs (citations removed).[33]
the court should not depart lightly from the ordinary rules relating to costs between party and party and the circumstances justifying the departure should be of an exceptional kind.[35]
it is frequently the case that litigants in family law proceedings have no personal experience of the court system or in dealing with legal professionals. a case involving division of marital property or arrangements for children may be the first time they have ever even entered a courtroom. necessarily such cases are replete with emotion and, as such, do not enable the individuals concerned to exercise dispassionate judgment about the issues raised, and the cost, both in emotional and financial terms, of pursing their preferred outcome.[36]
the issue whether costs should be ordered on a party and party basis or on an indemnity basis has acquired increasingly greater significance as the gap between the two bases appears to have grown. the gap has highlighted the conflict between two seemingly irreconcilable objectives. the first is protecting access to justice by only exposing an unsuccessful litigant in the usual course to an order for scale costs on a party and party basis. the second is relieving a successful litigant from the burden of costs which that litigant should not have been required to incur. these and other policy factors have been considered by the courts over a very long period in order to arrive at the principles which govern the undoubted discretion of courts to depart from ordering costs on a party and party basis and ordering costs on an indemnity basis.
in particular, we respectfully agree with cooper and merkel jj that there are “two seemingly irreconcilable objectives” at stake. placing great emphasis on the importance of one objective, namely “relieving a successful litigant from the burden of costs which that litigant should not have been required to incur” will inevitably lead to insufficient emphasis being placed on the importance of the other objective of “protecting access to justice by only exposing an unsuccessful litigant in the usual course to an order for scale costs on a party and party basis”. in our view, once it is recognised that ensuring access to justice is one of the key objectives of the “usual rule”, the claimed increasing disparity between scale costs and those being charged by lawyers becomes as much an argument against the awarding of indemnity costs as it is in favour of costs being ordered on that basis. with respect to the trial judge, we are not convinced that there is a great deal of difference between current “commercial realities” and those prevailing at the time kohan was decided. it should be noted that the costs agreement in kohan provided for a rate of payment three times in excess of the scale. however, even if there have been changes in the market place for legal services, we are not persuaded this should have any impact on the application of the “usual rule”, which seeks to balance competing public policy considerations.[43]
we recognise that the rules now expressly refer to orders for costs on an indemnity basis. we recognise also that the rules in this court are not precisely the same as those in other courts, however, there is nothing in the rules which indicates that the fundamental principle applied in other jurisdictions should not also be applied in this jurisdiction. indeed rule 19.18[46] makes clear that the “default” position is that costs are awarded on a party/party basis.[47]
evidence regarding the financial circumstances of the parties
in july 2022, the husband provided me with a $100,000.00 lump sum payment. from this sum, i have paid living expenses, counsel fees, mediation fees and accounting fees. i have a balance of approximately $20,000.00 remaining in my savings accounts to meet those expenses. i have outstanding fees owing to norman waterhouse lawyers of $82,544.20 (including gst), plus work in progress of $26,641.93 plus gst at 29 march 2023.[48]
the contentions of the parties
...the requirement that the power to award a gross sum should be exercised judicially does not mean that it must be exercised in any scientific or formulaic manner, at the heart of the judicial function is the responsibility to weigh up competing factors and considerations, many of which might conflict, to reach a determination. acting judicially carries with it an obligation to apply the rules of natural justice, to act impartially and to apply the law to the facts. ...[49]  he order sought constitutes an overreach. no order should be made. if the court exercises the discretion under s 117(2) of the fla any order should be calculated on a party/party basis and it should relate only to the proceedings which were discontinued. it is submitted that the quantum of any such order would be nominal. that fact mitigates against any order being made.[50]
discussion
the financial circumstances of the parties
receipt of legal aid
conduct of the parties
the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters,[52]
decisions about international travel are difficult to make because no-one can foretell the future and the decision i have to make here amounts to a leap of faith. the court determines discretionary matters within the framework of the evidence that it is presented.
the factual situation arising in this matter necessarily rendered any issue in respect of overseas travel complex and multi-faceted.
failure to comply with previous orders
