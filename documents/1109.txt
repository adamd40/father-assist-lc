legal principles
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).   identify the assets, liabilities and financial resources of the parties to the marriage, (b) identify and assess the relevant contributions of each of the parties within the meaning of s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c), (c) consider the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   identify and assess the relevant contributions of each of the parties within the meaning of s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c), (c) consider the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   consider the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.

the duration of the period of the parties’ cohabitation
working out if persons have a relationship as a couple (2) those circumstances may include any or all of the following:   the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.
a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case.
“living together, consistently with authority, should be construed as sharing a life together as a couple. section 4aa does not prescribe any way by which a couple may share a life together. its language is sufficiently broad to accommodate the great variety of ways a de facto relationship may exist. that conclusion is supported by the varied factors listed in s 4aa (2). in a given case, some of the factors in s 4aa (2) may be relevant and some may be irrelevant, some may have greater prominence than others...in particular, s 4aa(2) is a statutory recognition that what may constitute a genuine de facto relationship is not to be determined in the same way in every case by reference to rigid criteria that must always be satisfied. in that respect, the language of s 4aa (2)(b) does not assume that every de facto relationship must have a “common residence” to some “extent” and of some “nature”. such a construction is entirely denied by s 4aa(3).”
the evidence
“my parents have gifted me $60,000 in cash which they have hidden from centrelink. the money has been buried in tins in the garden...i want you to put the money into an account in your name. i don’t want centrelink to know anything about it.”
credit issues
section 4aa(2) matters
duration of the relationship
nature and extent of their common residence
“living together for the purposes of s 4aa(1) will often, perhaps usually, mean cohabitation of some residence by a couple for some period of time. but cohabitation of a residence or residences is not a necessary feature of “living together”. that phrase must be construed to take account of the many various ways in which two people may share their lives together in a modern world...two people, for any number of reasons, may not reside in the same residence, but nonetheless be in a de facto relationship in the sense required by s.4aa”
“it is contrary to the text of s 4aa and to statutory context and purpose to which reference has been made. it is also contrary to real-world considerations. it would be productive of injustice if two people who live apart (including for reasons of health) were incapable of remaining in a de facto relationship.” (emphasis added)
“...the full court recognised that it was possible for a husband and a wife who maintained “separate residences” to not be living separately and apart, so long as they live in a “single household”....the full court drew a distinction between living in separate houses as against separate households” that distinction, it was held, applied to the concept of cohabitation.

the care and support of children
the reputation and public aspects of the relationship
conclusion as to the commencement of a de facto relationship
“...when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality...it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved, the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. in such matters “reasonable satisfaction” shall not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences”
whether the court will adopt a global or an asset by asset approach to the assessment of the parties’ contributions
“16. although it is natural to assess financial contributions under s.79(4)(a) by reference to individual assets, it is also natural to assess the contribution of a spouse as homemaker and parent either by reference to the whole of the parties' property or to some part of that property. for ease of comparison and calculation it will be convenient in assessing the overall contributions of the parties at some stage to place the two types of contribution on the same basis, i.e. on a global or, alternatively, on an "asset-by-asset" basis. which of the two approaches is the more convenient will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. however, there is much to be said for the view that in most cases the global approach is the more convenient. it follows that the full court is quite entitled to prescribe that approach as a guideline in order to promote uniformity of approach within the court. in saying this we are not to be understood as denying the legitimacy of the trial judge's ascertainment in the first instance of the financial contributions of the parties by reference to particular assets. it is difficult to conceive how the trial judge in many cases could otherwise take account of such contributions as he is required to by s.79(4)(a) of the act. in this respect we agree with the comment of nygh j. in g and g that, although mathematical precision is certainly not required, there is ordinarily a need to know the circumstances in which assets were acquired and the general extent of each party's contribution to them. 17. the assessment of the parties' entitlements before the making of an order is another question, quite distinct from the assessment of their contributions. as a matter of construction of s.79 nygh j. is right in saying that the section imposes no obligation on the family court to pursue in relation to this issue either the global approach or the asset-by-asset approach to the exclusion of the other. we do not understand the full court in the present case to suggest otherwise. what the full court asserts is that the global approach is the only "realistic", that is, convenient, means of arriving at the entitlements of the parties. again, it seems to us that it will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, though in the majority of cases the global approach will be the more convenient and for this reason the full court is entitled to prescribe its adoption as a guideline in the majority of cases. the family court has rightly criticized the practice of giving over-zealous attention to the ascertainment of the parties' contributions, and we take this opportunity of expressing our unqualified agreement with that criticism, noting at the same time that the ascertainment of the parties' financial contributions necessarily entails reference to particular assets in the manner already indicated.”   the total period of cohabitation and marriage (“the marriage”) was slightly less than ten years, and there are no children of the relationship, (b) a very substantial proportion of the current net asset pool comprises assets that the husband held at the commencement of cohabitation, (c) with the sole exception of the suburb c property, where the parties lived during the marriage, each party kept their respective real property entirely separate from the other, (d) the parties did not acquire any property jointly during the marriage and there was no significant intermingling of funds, (e) with the sole exception of the manufactured home at town n, there is no evidence that during cohabitation, or in the period post separation, either party has made a direct financial contribution to the acquisition of any item of property belonging to the other, (f) putting aside the improvements to the suburb c property, there is no evidence which demonstrates that any increase in the value of real property that each party held at commencement of cohabitation is due to any circumstances other than market forces and is not due to any contribution made by the other party, and (g) the evidence demonstrates that there have been differing contributions to different categories of assets, and no contribution by one party to some of the assets introduced by the other.   a very substantial proportion of the current net asset pool comprises assets that the husband
