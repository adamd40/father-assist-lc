applicable law
standard of proof   in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.
reliability of the parties’ evidence ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... (citations omitted)  ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case:  5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... [169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide.  ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.

"party" means a party to the marriage concerned.

the applicable law as to spousal maintenance
72 right of spouse to maintenance   a party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first‑mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately whether: (a) by reason of having the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, (b) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment, or (c) for any other adequate reason,   by reason of having the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, (b) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment, or (c) for any other adequate reason,   by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment, or (c) for any other adequate reason,   for any other adequate reason,
having regard to any relevant matter referred to in subsection 75(2).   the liability under subsection (1) of a bankrupt party to a marriage to maintain the other party may be satisfied, in whole or in part, by way of the transfer of vested bankruptcy property in relation to the bankrupt party if the court makes an order under this part for the transfer.
... power of court in spousal maintenance proceedings   in proceedings with respect to the maintenance of a party to a marriage, the court may make such order as it considers proper for the provision of maintenance in accordance with this part.
taken together then, we would state the law as being that an award of spousal maintenance requires:
1. a threshold finding under s 72, 2. consideration of s 74 and s 75(2), no fettering principle that pre-separation standard of living must automatically be awarded where the respondent's means permit, and discretion exercised in accordance with the provisions of s 74, with "reasonableness in the circumstances" as the guiding principle.

it follows that if an order made by consent must be treated like any other non-consensual court order must be read and interpreted quite independently of what the parties subjectively might have intended thereby. it must be read as standing on its own feet, as it were[3][4].

the preferred approach ] in hickey and hickey and attorney-general for the commonwealth of australia (intervener) [2003] famca 395, (2003) flc 93-143 at [39] the full court, in setting out what the case law revealed as the “preferred approach” to the determination of an application under s 79 of the act, referred to four inter-related steps, including that “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of ss. 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”. the full court did not purport to elevate the preferred approach as being mandatory...  ] the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application pursuant to the provisions of section 79. that approach involves four interrelated steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (“the other factors”) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

step two: section 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) contributions ] in dickons v dickons [2012] famcafc 154, (2012) 50 fam lr 244 the full court said:  ] ... the task of assessing contributions is holistic and but part of a yet further holistic determination of what orders, if any, represent justice and equity in the particular circumstances of this particular relationship. so much is clear from the terms of s 79 itself and, in particular, s 79(2). the essential task is to assess the nature, form and extent of the contributions of all types made by each of the parties within the context of an analysis of their particular relationship.
... ] the necessarily imprecise “wide discretion” inherent in what is required by the section is made no more precise or coherent by attributing percentage figures to arbitrary time frames or categorisations of contributions within the relationship. indeed, we consider that doing so is contrary to the holistic analysis required by the section and, in the usual course of events, should be avoided.
... [37] although the use of the short-hand descriptor of a “kennon claim” is not of itself erroneous, it is liable to induce error because the issue is not a stand-alone claim, but is rather integral to the entire process (paysen & laukien [2020] famcafc 101, (2020) flc 93-960 at [48]–[50]). nor is it helpful to refer to the issue as a “kennon adjustment” because that epithet invites treatment of the issue as an isolated claim for an additional share of the available property.

step three: section 75(2) factors age and state of health income, property, financial resources and capacity for employment care of children under 18 years commitments of each of the parties to support themselves or a child responsibilities of either party to support any other person pension or benefit reasonable standard of living would maintenance assist education or training   effect on creditors extent wife, who seeks maintenance, has contributed to husbands earning capacity duration of marriage & effect on earning capacity of maintenance claimant protect parties role as a parent whether party cohabiting with another person & (naa)   child support to be provided any fact or circumstances justice requires to be taken into account
conclusion as to step 3 adjustment for section 75(2) factors ] here, the magnitude of the adjustment of four per cent, reflected in actual dollar terms, is $609,284.40 (including superannuation). to put that in perspective, that is less than one year’s after tax income of the husband, even assuming that his income was only $1.2 million. it is markedly less than the husband’s after tax income in 2017/2018.
...in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue. (emphasis added)
on our adjusted figure for the value of the parties net assets ($1,503,863), adjustment of 10% in the wife’s favour results in an increase in her entitlement of $150,386, and a corresponding reduction in the husband’s entitlement, producing a differential movement between them of $300,772 ... (emphasis added)  7] it is also important to recall what was said in phipson & phipson [2009] famcafc 28 when the full court was dealing with another appeal from the trial judge in the present proceedings:  ] it is always important to keep in mind that an adjustment of x% for s 75(2) factors leads to a disparity in the value of property received by the parties representing 2 x x%. it is that disparity, measured in “money terms”, that requires consideration in determining whether the result is just and equitable: see campbell v kuskey [1998] famca 10, (1998) flc 92-795 at 84,928.  8] the 10% adjustment his honour made on account of s 75(2) factors has led to a disparity in favour of the wife equivalent in value to 20% of the assets. in money terms this represents $187,733 out of a total asset pool of $938,665.  ] however, the 15 per cent adjustment made for s 75(2) factors represented a 30 per cent disparity in favour of the wife in respect of those factors. that translates in real money terms to approximately $4,075,000. ... [80] most importantly, it is to be considered in the light that the 30 per cent disparity produced by a 15 per cent adjustment on the divisible pool was, in real money terms, $4,075,000.  9] in our view, s 79(4)(e) requires those matters to be taken into account in arriving at orders that are just and equitable as between the parties. in arriving at an appropriate assessment for those factors, a dollar value of it should be uppermost in our minds [79] and, of course, the ultimate disparity in entitlements which it might produce. that dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests in property of the parties.
