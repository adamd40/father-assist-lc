the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
illicit drugs use
cannabis use   castano] disclosed [using cannabis at his business premises]. [mr castano] initially stated being unaware of his behaviour pre-lapse, but with challenging was able to identify self-sabotage attitude. [mr castano] was uncomfortable with being challenged + rationalized his use episode. to focus on early relapse warning signs and self-compassion.[20]
risk of mr castano being drug-affected whilst caring for x
ameliorating factors
other risks identified by ms castano
additional considerations
any views expressed by x and any factors (such as his maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to x’s views
the nature of x’s relationships with each of his parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to him, to spend time with him, and to communicate with him
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain him
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances, including the likely effect on x of any separation from either of his parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom he has been living
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect x’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of x’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of x, to provide for his needs, including emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of either of his parents, and any other relevant characteristics of x

any family violence involving x or a member of his family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of his family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility
conclusions
well, because, it’s not just about all of this indirect risk that those questions have been put to me. the consideration for me is also what happens for [x] and his father when they spend time together. what is the direct risk to [x] of being around his father? now i don’t see a lot of evidence of there being direct risk in terms of his parenting, his direct parenting of [x]. there is a lot of protective factors, well, there are several protective factors, and one is the quality of the relationship between [x] and his father... what i’m saying is we need to balance the risk factors and the safety factors, or the risk factors and the protective factors. if there’s a high risk of relapse, a higher risk of relapse, my point is that the relationship should continue and we put a safety guard around it... [x] needs to try and have a good opportunity to have as normalised a relationship as possible with his father.
