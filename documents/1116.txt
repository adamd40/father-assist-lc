standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
property adjustment: the law
property proceedings under part viii and the approach in hickey and stanford  identify the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, liabilities, and financial resources at the time of trial, and then determine whether it is just and equitable to adjust their interests pursuant to s 79(1),[12] (2) consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)–(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[13] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[14]   consider the parties’ contributions under s 79(4)(a)–(c), (3) consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[13] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[14]   consider the factors under s 79(4)(d)–(g) including, by virtue of s 79(4)(e), the ‘subjective considerations’ under s 75(2) insofar as they are relevant,[13] and then (4) ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[14]   ‘stand back’ to consider the justice and equity of the actual terms of order proposed to be made.[14]
identifying the parties' legal and equitable interests
marriage is for most couples an economic partnership. married couples live together and work together with the ultimate object of purchasing a home, paying it off, acquiring other assets with the overall object of attaining a higher standard of living. the reported decisions in respect of applications for settlement of property under sec. 79 of the act are unanimous hat both parties should share the economic fruits of a marriage, having regard to the provisions of sec. 79(4) and sec. 75(2), although not necessarily equally.[15]
to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are:   where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm (1998) flc 92—816 the full court said at 85,262: for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend (1995) flc 92—569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654:   where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend (1995) flc 92—569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654:
in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly.  in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw (1981) flc 91—092 at 76,644:
as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[20]   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[20]   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[20]
whilst not seeking to place a fetter upon the exercise of a trial judge in individual cases, it seems to us that the concept of adding monies reasonably disposed of back into the pool ought to be the exception rather than the rule. the parties are entitled to reasonably conduct their affairs post-separation in a manner that is consistent with properly getting on with their lives. providing modest support for their adult children or taking not inappropriate holidays for themselves seems to fit comfortably within that description.[23]
the parties' positions based on the asset pool as determined
by reference to the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, is it just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79?
section 79(4)(a)–(c) — assessment of contributions
it was not in dispute that the primary judge applied proper principle in determining that the assessment of the impact of the husband's initial contributions could only properly occur after she assessed "the totality of the parties' contribution—based entitlement over the entirety of the marriage and post-separation" (at [210]).
in that respect, in pierce v pierce (1999) flc 92—844 ("pierce"), the full court stated at [28]:
...it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. (emphasis added)
to similar effect, in cabbell & cabbell [2009] famcafc 205, the full court stated at [54] that in considering the parties' contributions, it is necessary to trace the use of those assets and consider the foundation that they laid for the subsequent accumulation of wealth by the parties. that is, in evaluating the parties' contributions, it was necessary for the primary judge to have regard to the context of the husband's initial contribution and specifically, to the opportunity that initial contribution created and the impact of that initial contribution on the subsequent wealth of the parties as at the date of the hearing. (emphasis added)
section 79(4)(a): direct financial contributions
section 79(4)(b): direct and indirect non-financial contributions to property
section 79(4)(c): contributions to the welfare of the family, including contributions as homemaker or parent
conclusion regarding the parties’ contributions
section 79(4)(d)–(g), including s 75(2) — other factors
conclusion regarding the division of parties’ non-superannuation net assets.
final assessment: a just and equitable exercise of discretion?
... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[51]

[4] order of judge turnbull, in pfeiffer & pfeiffer (federal circuit and family court of australia, lnc123/2022), 22 august 2023. [5] exhibit j1 – the balance sheet set out in these reason’s has slightly modified the balance sheet in that exhibit.[6] at the commencement of the trial the wife sought to argue that the court should exercise discretion to increase cash payment and in turn reduction of a superannuation payment. that position was not argued at the point of final submissions and the parties' agreed to a separate alteration of the superannuation pool.[7] the order set out at the commencement of these reason’s has slightly amended the draft order supplied by the parties'.[8] the disputed item regarding the potential add-back of $20,000 for the expenditure of the husband’s long service leave payments has been removed from the balance sheet forming part of j1 and will be assessed separately in these reasons.[9] stanford & stanford (2012) 247 clr 108, 122 [41].[10] mallet & mallet [1984] hca 21; (1984) 156 clr 605, 608 (gibbs cj), noting that the ‘very wide discretion to make such order as [the court] thinks fit’ is conferred only ‘when [the court] is satisfied that it is just and equitable that an order should be made’, with his honour further stating that ‘there are some broad principles to which the court is required to give effect, and some circumstances which it is required to take into account’ in making an order, and with dawson j (at 647) referring to the just and equitable requirement as the ‘overriding requirement’.[11] hickey & hickey [2003] famca 395, [39], noting the remarks of the full court in norman & norman [2010] famcafc 66, [60], at which their honours state that ‘[i]t is the mandatory legislative imperative (to reach a conclusion that is just and equitable) that drives the ultimate result’ and that ‘[f]or all its usefulness and merit [the four—step approach] merely illuminates the path to the ultimate result’. i also note the three ‘fundamental propositions’ set out in stanford & stanford (n6) 120 [36], as alternative guidance for trial judges, ultimately towards the same objective as the approach in hickey, namely to cover off on all necessary points and criteria in pt viii.[12] stanford & stanford (n9) 120 [37], noting the explanatory remarks in lotta & lotta [2017] famca 50, [283]–[284], importantly that ‘[s]uch a consideration should not be guided by an assumption that the parties’ rights to or interests in property are or should be different from those that then exist’ and that ‘the court needs to conclude that it would be unjust or unfair to leave property rights intact under s 79(2) of the act’.[13] lotta & lotta (n12) [289].[14] teal & teal [2010] famcafc 120, [70], referring to phillips & phillips [2002] famca 350 in which, at [68], their honours discuss the importance of considering the ‘real impact’ of an order to assess whether the result is just and equitable.[15] kowaliw & kowaliw (1981) flc 91—092, 76,643—76,644.
