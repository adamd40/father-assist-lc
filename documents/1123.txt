grounds for review
4.1 the wife took no steps to her detriment. [a57] 4.2 the wife did not pay rent for the last 18 months of cohabitation. [a57] the arbitrator failed to property balance the contributions of the applicant as a homemaker and parent when assessing the financial contributions of the respondent as four times greater than that of the applicant as being the determinant or only factor in assessing the contribution based entitlement of the parties. notwithstanding the arbitrator found that crucial parts of the evidence of the respondent [and this father] was untruthful, not acceptable, and/or where there was conflict between the parties, accepted the evidence of the applicant including:- 6.1 the period of contributions as maintained by the applicant. [a26] 6.2 the conversations as to the dispute between the parties as to the loan agreement occurred after it was executed as maintained by the applicant. [a55] 6.3 the maintaining of the respondent and his father that there were no conversations between them prior to the demand of $500,000.00. [a101] 6.4 the finding that the respondent and his father had not been frank. [a104] 6.5 the father’s oral evidence as to repayment of the sum of $500,000.00 was contrary to his affidavit evidence.
found the alleged liability of $2.6 million would be repaid by the respondent. there was no evidence to support a “view” or “finding” that “it is unlikely it [the loan of $2.6 million] would be called upon in the short to medium term” when the evidence [or lack of evidence] supported a finding that the loan would never be called upon by the applicant’s father. [a107] the finding that the adjustment in favour of the applicant was 8 percent was plainly wrong and inadequate in the circumstances including:-
8.1 the comparison between the parties’ financial positions after the assessment of the contribution based entitlement. 8.2 the effect of the evidence that the loan between the respondent and his father would not be payable “in the short to medium term”. 8.3 the credit issues relating to the respondent and his father’s evidence relating to the asserted loan. 8.4 the young age of the subject child and the applicant’s financial responsibility towards that child for of period of at least 10 years. 8.5 the greater financial security of the respondent as opposed to the applicant.
requirement for grounds to identify questions of law
the following are generally regarded as questions of law:
the following are not generally regarded as errors of law,
consideration
ground 1 – alleged failure to afford procedural fairness
an arbitrator must conduct an arbitration with procedural fairness (for example, giving each party to the arbitration a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to respond to anything raised by another party).  he rules of procedural fairness do not have immutably fixed content, the content of procedural fairness may vary according to the circumstances of the particular case. procedural fairness is essentially practical, it is not an abstract concept. the concern of the law is the avoidance of practical injustice.
... “[t]he rules of procedural fairness do not have immutably fixed content ... ‘[f]airness is not an abstract concept. it is essentially practical. whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice’”.[32] procedural fairness necessarily has a variable content, it can be “provided by different means in different contexts and may well be provided by different means in a single context”.[33] it “is defined by practical judgments about its content and application”.[34]
ground 2 – error in the exercise of discretion by asserted reliance on extraneous and irrelevant considerations in refusing the adjournment application  take account of the duty imposed on the party by subsection (1) and (b) to assist the parties to comply with the duty.   to encourage people to use dispute resolution mechanisms (other than judicial ones) to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made under this act, provided the mechanisms are appropriate in the circumstances and proper procedures are followed, and (c) to encourage people to use, in appropriate circumstances, arbitration to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made, and to provide ways of facilitating that use.   to encourage people to use, in appropriate circumstances, arbitration to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made, and to provide ways of facilitating that use.
ground 3 – in finding that the wife’s contributions to the asset pool justified a 22.5 per cent adjustment, the arbitrator was unreasonable and plainly unjust
ground 4 – the arbitrator considered irrelevant matters
4.1 the wife took no steps to her detriment. [a57] 4.2 the wife did not pay rent for the last 18 months of cohabitation. [a57] (as per the original)
the wife again took no step to her detriment. she did not sell her unit at [suburb e] to assist with the purchase or renovation, for example. she in fact invested none of her own money in the property. she has had the opportunity to live in a substantial family home in [suburb c] for the past three years without paying for the right to occupy it, including for nearly 18 months after separation.
ground 5 – failure to properly balance the contributions of the wife as homemaker and parent with the financial contributions of the husband
and [ground] 5, that is a question of his finding at paragraph 140. the argument there, the husband brought three times as much wealth to the relationship than did the wife, and further significant contributions were made by his father, and he renovated the property. but the wife gave evidence that she worked at the property. there’s no comment about that in that paragraph, but he might be talking about financial contributions there. he did find, in paragraph 141, that the contributions were equal.
ultimately, the husband brought almost three times as much wealth to a 4 year relationship than did the wife. further significant contributions were made by him by reason of the highly favourable arrangement to acquire the former matrimonial home with his father, arrangements which gave the parties an opportunity to accumulate significant wealth in the form of desirable property in [suburb c], property which the husband could afford to acquire and renovate himself using his pre-relationship property and with only modest indirect contribution by the wife to the [y bank] mortgage payments. otherwise, the parties had to contribute nothing at all to the acquisition and improvement of the property from their own resources, since the husband's father has never asked for any of the purchase price to be paid under the terms of the deed - and when he did, it seems he didn't mean what he said. these contributions arc weighed together with 5½ years of personal exertion contributions which i found to be equal.
ground 6 – asserted error in respect to various factual findings, leading to the arbitrator’s finding that the alleged liability of $2.6 million would be repaid by the husband
ground 7 – contention that the arbitrator’s finding that “it is unlikely [the loan of $2.6 million] will be called upon in the short to medium term” was not supported by the evidence
...when it’s coupled with the observation that it will be unlikely to be repaid in the short to medium term, that has to be taken into account somehow, and that’s ignored, completely ignored. and that, your honour, has to be an error of law – just failed to consider that. having made the finding, he failed to then equate that to the balance sheet.
ground 8 – the arbitrator’s finding that the adjustment in favour of the wife was eight per cent was plainly wrong and inadequate in the circumstances
