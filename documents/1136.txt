introduction
brief background
the evidence
live with orders by consent
on attendance at the school, federal agents were assisted by the year 8 coordinator at the school, who had knowledge of the family dynamics, to facilitate the handover of the child to the applicant. the applicant and child subsequently met in a private office at the school in the presence of federal agents where the return of the child to the applicant was completed. in the course of completing the order and ensuing discussions between applicant and child, it became clear to the applicant that the child was going to resist her return to the applicant. not wanting to further damage the relationship with her child, the applicant negotiated with the child and agreed they should attempt a gradual process of rebuilding their relationship over future meetings at a time and place to be negotiated. in the meantime the applicant acquiesced to the wishes of the child to return to class and remain in the care of the father.
afp engaged in communications with [x] through the door of the [motor vehicle]. [x] stated she was not going to go with police and did not want to go home as she was scared of her mother. after approximately five minutes of speaking through the [motor vehicle] door, and in compliance with the direction of judge jenkins, afp made the decision to enter the [motor vehicle] by way of force and forcing open the [motor vehicle] door. the father [mr calden] was advised what was to occur. force (minimal necessary) was applied with a method of entry tool to force open the door, while maintaining communications with [x]. afp spoke with [x], explaining the recovery order and the federal court had ordered her to return to her mother. [x] became extremely distressed and stated she would not allow police to take her. afp continued communication with [x] to reassure her that it was ok to come with police and she would be returned safely to her mother in [suburb j]. [x] continued to increase in distress and moved onto a bed and into the corner and began yelling that she would not go with police and not to touch her. after several attempts to reassure [x] and explain that they would need to pick her up if she would not walk to the police car, along with other police present restrained her by talking hold of her arms and legs. [x] began to kick out at police and thrash her arms and legs, resisting being removed from the [motor vehicle]. [x] was exhibiting extreme distress and continued to scream and struggle. [x] was eventually removed from the [motor vehicle] and placed in the rear of the police vehicle where she continued to struggle for approximately 30 seconds, before calming once the vehicle doors were shut and likely realising the recovery order would be executed without her consent. afp drove [x] to the home address of [jaros] [the mother], [k street, suburb l] sa. upon arrival about 2.45am, police arrived at [jaros’] address and [x] entered the premises address along with [jaros] and [jaros’] mother, executing the recovery order.

where one party to litigation is compelled, either by reason of a rule of court, or by reason of a specific order of the court, or otherwise, to disclose documents or information, the party obtaining the disclosure cannot, without the leave of the court, use it for any purpose other than that for which it was given unless it is received into evidence.
for "special circumstances" to exist it is enough that there is a special feature of the case which affords a reason for modifying or releasing the undertaking and is not usually present. the matter then becomes one of the proper exercise of the court’s discretion, many factors being relevant.
should the court order the father to pay the mother’s costs of her recovery application filed in june 2022?   the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, (b) whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and   the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and   whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and   whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and   whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and
it should be borne in mind that the allegations made in the father’s affidavits were extremely serious and if true raised a real prospect that [x] was in imminent danger of self-harm if she remained in the mother’s care. i concluded that i was not satisfied that there was sufficient evidence reasonably capable of belief that gave rise to a concern that the child was at either at immediate or long-term risk if she spent time in the care of the mother. i also concluded that it appeared that the father had been trying to influence the children, and in particular [x], in order to obtain a forensic advantage in the proceedings.
should the court make a notation in relation to the payment of school fees?
