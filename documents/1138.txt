the law
69f applicant may be in contempt a court may proceed with the hearing of proceedings in relation to a child even though the person who instituted the proceedings has failed to comply with an order of the court or of another court having jurisdiction under this act.   the mere fact a party had disobeyed an order does not bar the party from being heard on a subsequent application,[3] (b) the decision is one of discretion,[4] (c) the rule applies even in circumstances where there has been no application for a contempt or contravention,[5] (d) the court can exercise its discretion and refuse to hear a party who is in breach of an order “only if that party makes an application in the same proceedings or in the same cause in which the disobedience of an order has occurred”,[6] (e) no question as to a party being heard arises “if that party is defending, rather than bringing, an application”,[7] and (f) in exercising discretion, the court must balance procedural justice and public policy considerations, which the latter including “the party’s disobedience ... impede[ing] the course of justice in the cause by making it more difficult for the court to ascertain the truth, or to enforce the orders which it may make, or the party’s further application constitutes an abuse of process in the circumstances, then the court is unlikely to exercise its discretion in favour of hearing the party or entertaining the application of the party”.[8]   the decision is one of discretion,[4] (c) the rule applies even in circumstances where there has been no application for a contempt or contravention,[5] (d) the court can exercise its discretion and refuse to hear a party who is in breach of an order “only if that party makes an application in the same proceedings or in

in fahmi [(1995) flc 92-637], and again more recently in watson v watson (2013) 49 fam lr 239, (2013) flc 93-530, [2013] famcafc 25 (watson) at [25]–[37], the full court discussed the existence of a court’s discretion to refuse to entertain an application brought by an applicant who is in contempt of orders made in the same proceedings. in contrast, as can be seen, s 69f avails of the discretion to entertain an application in relation to a child brought by an applicant who is in contempt of orders, regardless of when and in what proceedings the breached orders were made.
section 69f is intended to invest the court with broad discretion as to whether an application under pt vii of the act, filed by an applicant who has failed to comply with a past order made under the act, is entertained. its initial purpose was to ensure that applicants would not be shut out from contesting orders in respect of children through operation of the common law rule, which operated as a strict rule with specific exceptions at the time s 69f was first enacted as s 66 of the act. now, as a consequence of fahmi and watson, the common law rule is applied more flexibly as a discretionary rule in this jurisdiction.
... when the discretion under s 69f of the act is enlivened, its exercise is motivated by the same type of considerations discussed in fahmi and watson and depends upon the balance which must be struck between the applicant’s right to procedural justice and countervailing public policy considerations, the ambit of which is not confined (watson at [36(g)]). locking an applicant out of procedural access to a court and the consequent deprivation of the opportunity for substantive relief is a serious step and should not be lightly taken.
discussion  the mother has failed to comply with orders of this court, (b) she has filed an amended application in proceeding which seeks to discharge interim orders, she does not give evidence of what steps she will take if she is unsuccessful in that application, (c) there are significant factual issues that will need to be determined in respect of the competing allegations of the parties, (d) the mother makes significant allegations of serious risks of harm to the child which are denied by the father, and (e) the child and mother remain outside the commonwealth of australia, with any prospect of the child being returned to australia as unlikely to be successful if the mother is not provided the opportunity to participate in these proceedings.   she has filed an amended application in proceeding which seeks to discharge interim orders, she does not give evidence of what steps she will take if she is unsuccessful in that application, (c) there are significant factual issues that will need to be determined in respect of the competing allegations of the parties, (d) the mother makes significant allegations of serious risks of harm to the child which are denied by the father, and (e) the child and mother remain outside the commonwealth of australia, with any prospect of the child being returned to australia as unlikely to be successful if the mother is not provided the opportunity to participate in these proceedings.   there are significant factual issues that will need to be determined in respect of the competing allegations of the parties, (d) the mother makes significant allegations of serious risks of harm to the child which are denied by the father, and (e) the child and mother remain outside the commonwealth of australia, with any prospect of the child being returned to australia as unlikely to be successful if the mother is not provided the opportunity to participate in these proceedings.   the mother makes significant allegations of serious risks of harm to the child which are denied by the father, and (e) the child and mother remain outside the commonwealth of australia, with any prospect of the child being returned to australia as unlikely to be successful if the mother is not provided the opportunity to participate in these proceedings.   the child and mother remain outside the commonwealth of australia, with any prospect of the child being returned to australia as unlikely to be successful if the mother is not provided the opportunity to participate in these proceedings.
