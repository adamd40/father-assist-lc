the court’s duty is to deliver individual justice, for the child affected, in every case.[13]
...cases involving the actual or potential relocation of child far away from one of their parents are particularly difficult for the court involving, as they do, competing legal principles relating to freedom of movement, and the entitlement of children to have a beneficial level of relationship with not just one but both of their parents.[15]
...justice boland’s decision is not a “guideline” in the sense that it sets a benchmark for determination of similar cases. further, it is apparent from the multitude of decisions of judges in interim hearings confirmed on appeal, that the principle issue in relocation cases is not whether the case is “an emergency”. the determination of issues regarding children whether on an interim basis or at a final hearing is by reference to the best interests principle.[19]
