will there be an adverse impact on the mother’s parental capacity to the detriment of x?  in re andrew the full court observed that the welfare of the child remains the paramount consideration and in considering such welfare, the court must take into account, any anxiety held by the primary carer concerning the child’s potential harm where such anxiety is likely to adversely impact that person’s care-giving ability. in taking account of the beliefs of the primary carer and the effects of such beliefs on that person and the consequent harm to the child, a subjective test is required. (b) however, it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: russell & close [1993] famca 62 (‘russell & close’). (c) it is not necessary that the belief should be reasonably and objectively based, but rather whether it is genuinely held: russell & close. (d) despite no apparent expert evidence in support of the primary carer’s apprehension, the full court in dunst & dunst [2016] famcafc 15 at [119] did not criticise the trial judge for concluding that whilst the available evidence fell short of proving the primary carer’s capacity would deteriorate and impinge the children’s best interest (there having been a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (‘ptsd’) and expert evidence of the genuineness of the apprehension but not about such apprehension impinging capacity), the trial judge nonetheless found that the primary carer’s fear was genuine and objectively reasonable and remained a feature of the evidence favouring curtailment of the children’s interaction with the other party.   however, it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: russell & close [1993] famca 62 (‘russell & close’).

in the event that no finding of unacceptable risk is made, what is the father’s capacity to provide for x’s needs?
are there any practical issues arising from either party’s proposed relief?
what about family violence?
is there a prospect of either party defaulting on orders made by the court so as to (for example) cause the court to make orders that will least likely lead to future litigation?
how do i promote an ongoing meaningful relationship between x and the father?
should the mother be allocated sole parental responsibility?
should a parenting co-ordinator be appointed?  the mother holding sole parental responsibility on two discrete areas, (b) the making of detailed and clear (to use the words of the single expert) orders affording the parties zero room to negotiate and limited opportunity for communication, (c) providing a clear pathway for third party service providers to navigate requests made by either party about x, and (d) a deliberate decision not to include in any way a provision to the effect of “unless the parties agree”.   the making of detailed and clear (to use the words of the single expert) orders affording the parties zero room to negotiate and limited opportunity for communication, (c) providing a clear pathway for third party service providers to navigate requests made by either party about x, and (d) a deliberate decision not to include in any way a provision to the effect of “unless the parties agree”.   providing a clear pathway for third party service providers to navigate requests made by either party about x, and (d) a deliberate decision not to include in any way a provision to the effect of “unless the parties agree”.   a deliberate decision not to include in any way a provision to the effect of “unless the parties agree”.

what orders and notations should be made to support the arrangements for x?
