wife’s offer to settle
consideration of the parties’ offers to settle
...the insertion of s 117c in the legislation is clear indication of the desire of parliament to enable parties to avoid unnecessary litigation by indicating to the other party an appropriate basis upon which litigation can be settled. the failure to heed a reasonable offer in the circumstances where there is adequate knowledge to the parties at the time of the offer is made to give it proper consideration, is something to which very significant weight indeed ought normally to be given.   the stage of the proceeding at which the offer was received, (b) the time allowed to the offeree to consider the offer, (c) the extent of the compromise offered, (d) the offeree’s prospects of success, assessed as at the date of the offer, (e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed, and (f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in the event of the offeree’s rejecting it.   the time allowed to the offeree to consider the offer, (c) the extent of the compromise offered, (d) the offeree’s prospects of success, assessed as at the date of the offer, (e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed, and (f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in the event of the offeree’s rejecting it.   the extent of the compromise offered, (d) the offeree’s prospects of success, assessed as at the date of the offer, (e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed, and (f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in the event of the offeree’s rejecting it.   the offeree’s prospects of success, assessed as at the date of the offer, (e) the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed, and (f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in the event of the offeree’s rejecting it.   the clarity with which the terms of the offer were expressed, and (f) whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in the event of the offeree’s rejecting it.   whether the offer foreshadowed an application for an indemnity costs in the event of the offeree’s rejecting it.   the offer was conveyed at a stage of the proceedings where the parties had a reasonable knowledge of the financial circumstances of the other and of the value of their assets and superannuation. not all values may have been known precisely, but there was sufficient information for the parties to attend mediation and to negotiate. i am satisfied the wife had adequate knowledge at the time the offer was made to give it proper consideration, (b) whilst the wife had concerns about the business valuation, the business comprised a relatively small part of the parties’ assets and was ultimately valued at a lower figure than was used for the purposes of the husband’s offer. the wife’s own evidence at trial was inconsistent with her belief the business was of significant value, including to the effect that the husband was a poor businessman, that he didn’t work hard in the business and his financial contributions generated from the business were modest, (c) the offer was conveyed sufficiently early (more than 12 months prior to the final hearing), such that the parties would have avoided significant legal costs had it been accepted, (d) the wife was provided with 28 days to consider the offer to settle, which i consider to be a reasonable period of time considering the parties’ financial circumstances are not complex, (e) as is evident from the outcome of these proceedings, the husband’s offer to settle was a reasonable offer, (f) the offer was expressed in clear terms, setting out the assets as agreed by the parties in mediation (this was not disputed by the wife, although she contended some of the values later proved not to be current or accurate), clearly identifying what each party would receive and articulating the effect of the offer in both percentage and monetary terms, and (g) the husband recorded his belief that the parties’ home was of a higher value than the value relied upon in his offer. i note the following comments made by wilson j in agosti & agosti [2021] fedcfamc1f 72 at [34], which also apply to this matter:   whilst the wife had concerns about the business valuation, the business comprised a relatively small part of the parties’ assets and

once it is recognised, as it must be, that the relevant date for the consideration of property and its value is the date of the trial in court or the arbitral hearing in an arbitration, then it must also be recognised that often the value of real estate increases between the date of the rejection of an offer of compromise and the date of a trial in court or a hearing in an arbitration. but the mere fact of that occurrence should not deprive a party of his or her costs where that party has bettered at trial or arbitration the sum that was the subject of the offer of compromise. where property prices are increasing, it is always possible for an offeror of a compromise to state that the offer is open for a prescribed period but not beyond. if the market increases between the rejection or lapse of that offer, a respondent can hedge his or her risk by putting a different offer of compromise to reflect the movement in property prices. but that is an altogether different proposition to saying that by reason of the increase in property prices a party who, after trial or arbitration, betters the sum that was earlier offered should not have his or her costs.
such other matters as the court considers relevant
