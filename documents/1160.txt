... counsel for the icl stated very clearly in his final submissions that her proposal “does not depend on sexual abuse”. the major concern of the icl was that the prospect of spending time with the father is seriously frightening for [t]. [ms m] said in her oral evidence that [t] continues to express fear of the father. she considered that [t]’s fear is based on her actual experience but, as noted, she could not exclude the possibility that her problems are due to an over-load of information about the adult dispute from the mother. as indicated, i am satisfied that the mother has burdened t inappropriately with such material. examples are [t]’s references to the sale of the former matrimonial home, the mother’s attendance at ‘the divorcion’ and lies being told about the mother by friends of the father in the present proceedings. ... there is no doubt that [t] currently expresses strong opposition to and fear of spending time with the father. there could be any number of reasons why she is so oppositional and fearful but i am satisfied that she is genuinely frightened by the prospect of spending time with the father. it seems to me that [t] experienced a chronically frightening, stressful environment in the family home prior to her parents’ separation. no doubt she was scared by some of the father’s behaviour, as indeed would have been the case with some of the mother’s conduct. in my view, it is significant that she has been spoken to by jirt officers and [ms m] about the father’s alleged behaviour toward her since the separation. she was present when the mother discussed with [ms m] her intention to have the father charged with breach of the apprehended violence order. she gave evidence in the avo proceedings but, according to [ms m], she became too distressed to continue that process. in these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that she is currently fearful of the father.[1]
i took [x] to the toilet, and after he finished having a wee, he was waving his penis around and thrusting his pelvis back and forth. i asked what he was doing. he said, ‘this is what [mr d] does in front of me’.
the icl’s submissions
the law
...as has frequently been emphasised interim parenting proceedings, and orders made as a consequence, are a necessary but temporary measure until all the evidence can be tested, evaluated and weighed at a final hearing by the making of final parenting orders. decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires, or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing (s 61db).[2]
in our view, findings made at an interim hearing should be couched with great circumspection, no matter how firmly a judge’s intuition may suggest that the finding will be borne out after a full testing of the evidence.[3]
the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.[4]
as would be immediately apparent, this approach enables the court to appropriately and carefully deal with contentious issues relevant to the welfare of the child, and for those issues to not be ignored.[5]
childs best interests: the s60cc factors  lilley] acknowledged he has been verbally abusive on the telephone and has sent verbally abusive text messages to [ms gabor] when she has requested changes in spend time arrangements.
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[10]
