reasons for judgment
judge glass:
contraventions
count 1
the mother enrolled [y] in a day-care facility in [suburb c] from 6 months through to four. the mother didn't consult me or take into account my opinions or suggestions regarding the day care that [y] was to attend. i have not filed a contravention for these breaches, though i will if this continues. [in] october 2021 until mid january i contacted the mother on many occasions regarding kindergarten. the mother said she can not afford it. i enrolled [y] and said i would pay for it. i contacted the mother to attempt to arrange for [y] to attend a government funded 4 year old kindergarten program. i researched and suggested three kindergarten centres in our local area where other children attending are likely to attend the same primary school. his older brother had no friends when he started school. annexed hereto and marked "7" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. the mother was very dismissive of me, yet together, [y] had a great outcome. annexure kindergarten. given [y]'s speech delay, i felt strongly that attending kindergarten would be necessary and beneficial for him. a kindergarten close to his school where he would have friends attend. given over 98% of australian children attend 4 year old kinder, i don't believe i was being unreasonable. i had previously requested communication with the mother to plan [y]'s pre-school years and speech delay and, as usual, received an extremely dismissive response. annexed hereto and marked "7" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. the mother insisted that [y] continue to attend the day care facility in [suburb c]. i then took steps to enrol [y] in a kindergarten program near my house where i would be able to take him when he was in my care. i did not agree to [y] attending this day-care. it is far away and not supportive of me as father who has equal and shared responsibility. annexed hereto and marked "7" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. i have not filed a contravention for these breaches, though i will if this continues. the mother promptly responded with anger, however she did agree to send [y] to a different kindergarten program closer to the children's school. i agreed and [y] commenced at [town d]. a perfect outcome in my opinion. annexed hereto and marked "7" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. i am shocked that the mother is now filing a contravention against me in this matter and requesting sole parental responsibility be given to her. i feel it is neglectful to refuse to send a four year old child with a speech delay to kindergarten. [y] was being forced to sleep for two hours everyday at day-care. [y] did not like it and i did not want [y] attending a day-care program prior to attending school where he is being forced to sleep. [y] did not like it and said he was staring at the ceiling the whole time. the mother did not care and said all the children are sleeping. if i hadn't taken action to enrol [y] in kinder in 2022 he would not have attended and the mother and father, including the mother's parents would not have benefited from the program. annexed hereto and marked "7" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. please refer count 1 and paragraphs 33-38 of the mother's affidavit, given that i sought communication from the mother regarding kindergarten on a number of occasions and that it is a generally accepted position that 4 year old children attend kinder, i firmly believe that my action to enrol [y] in kinder is not a contravention. annexed hereto and marked "7" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. given the mother and father enrolled [y] at [town d], close to his school, proves that the mother is able to co-parent if she chooses to. annexed hereto and marked "7" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten.[5]
counts 2 & 3
counts 9, 10, 16 & 17
count 18
each party shall advise the other by way of the ‘our family wizard’ app as soon as practicable of any illness suffered by the children, and any emergency relating to the children, including evidence of medical treatment received.[8]
counts 21 & 22
once again, the mother believes the father is unable to care for the children which is disrespectful. .... the mother's affidavit and annexures evidence that i tried to arrange drop off times. the mother created confusion and was difficult to communicate with and then files a contravention, when it was her who created the uncertainty in where i should take the children. she often changes the location of changeover to suit her whereabouts which i never know until the last minute.[12]
count 26
count 28
after the judge created new orders so the children could be aligned. unfortunately, the children were still mis-aligned and the mother was unable to agree to allow the children to be aligned. it makes me very upset the mother deliberately causes harm and distress to the children. i am not sure why and am unable to explain why she does this. i agreed to her proposal because she would not agree to allow the children to be together. i agreed to minimise conflict. only to cause conflict and contraventions.[13]
count 31
this highlights the mother would rather the children by in daycare against professionals advice to keep children home given there are 50, 000 covid cases a day. the mother's dis-respect and disdain towards the father as an equal parent is evident. her actions are not in the children's best interest. the mother would rather the children suffer than allow the children to have a meaningful relationship with the father.[14]
count 32
count 36
evidence the father explains to the mother the children are unwell. she dismisses and disregards the comment. files a contravention. it's fabricated to create a contravention.[16]
counts 45, 46 & 47
count 48
count 49
it's very disrespectful and demeaning of the mother not allow the children to say goodbye to their father. the mother grabbed the children and hurried them away from their father. i am not sure why she would not sign [x] in. only to try and make the father look incompetent.[17]
count 50
yes, [x] was upset that the mother is abusive! i spent some time explaining to [x] it's okay to return to his mother. i explained to the mother, if she abuses [x] again, i will be involving child protection! thankfully the mother's abuse lies in the grey area. still causing emotional and psychological harm. i note the children will have to learn to cope with their mother's mental health issues. shaving [x]'s head when he has long hair and wants to grow it longer. and forcing him to have a hair cut everytime she takes him to [town g]. i was disgusted to hear he was carried in by both the mother and grandmother, kicking and screaming. i am appalled and it breaks my heart to know this happens and there's nothing i can do. i had to revoke the ivo to minimise the harm caused by the mother. [x] is [hundreds of] kms away from home in a small country town where this abuse occurs. hereto and marked "12" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [x] repeatedly getting a hair cut agianst his will and often after he's had a haircut in the fathers care.[18]
relief sought
ultimately the judicial role is to determine the proceedings on the material presented to the court. it is not an investigative body conducting an inquisition but rather it is an adjudicative body determining a dispute that is brought before it.[30]
primary considerations
the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents
the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm or from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to their views
the nature of the children’s relationships with each of their parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the children, to spend time with the children, and to communicate with them
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of any changes in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the children of any separation from either of their parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom they have been living
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the children’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the children’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of the children, to provide for the needs of the children, including emotional and intellectual needs
the father's non-compliance with the orders is also affecting the children in a profound way and i am concerned for their well-being. the children are exposed to inconsistency around changeover arrangements. the father does not seem to understand that they need consistency and routine. [x] is especially sensitive to the effects of overholding and makes excuses for his father, including suggesting that it is his fault he is late returning. the children's behaviour has deteriorated and become more difficult to manage. they come home to me often irritable and argumentative.[39]
the mother refuses to take [x] to extra-curricular activities. this includes [sports activities]. i have had to choose sports the children can participate in which do not require the mother's co-operation. in 2022 and now again in 2023, [x] has only been able to play and train in [sports] every second week during his father's time. the mother refuses to take him. i do not know how long this can last and i feel this behaviour is irrational and detrimental to [x]. if the children's time with their father is reduced they will miss out on a wide range of activities that the father organises. the mother pulled [x] out of [sports] because i was taking him during my time. the mother did not believe i should be allowed to take the children during my time. this irrational behaviour is not only against court orders but has a negative impact on the children. i have not filed a contravention for these breaches, though i will if this continues. [x] continues to play [sports], however it is disappointing that he can only play and train every second week. i encourage these activities to help with [x]'s social and focus skills. i have enrolled the children in [sports], [extra] classes are allowed for the week when they are with their mother and i have been able to take them twice during my time.[40]
...for the last two and a half years, the mother has been giving x] a haircut and [y] up in [town g], and [y] has said to me that he doesn’t want to get his hair cut – like, he’s getting really, really upset. one time, i had given him a haircut that he really liked, and then he went into his mother’s care a couple of days later. the mother has then gone and shaved his head off and – and shaved it off to number 1, and he was absolutely traumatised. ... ...every single school holidays, he has been forced to get his hair cut. i called – [x] was very upset, very distressed. i called the hairdresser in [town g], and she explained to me. she said, “yes, i noticed that the mother was carrying [x] in kicking and screaming to get a haircut.” she goes, “he clearly didn’t want a haircut. but then when he left, the grandma – and grandma talked him into getting a haircut.” [x] told me that the mum said, “if you don’t get your hair cut, you won’t be allowed to watch your tablet for the whole time that you’re at the farm and for the whole trip home.” fast forward to the first term holidays, she gave him a haircut again, and he was very distressed. two weeks prior to the end of second term ending, i was called into a meeting at the school with four teachers – two of his classroom teachers, the wellbeing coordinator, and the vice principal – and they all said to me, “can you please explain why [x] is in the classroom cutting his hair every day”, and i said that he’s – i know he’s traumatised by getting his hair cut, and then when i spoke to [x] he said he was cutting his hair every day because he wanted to show everyone that, “hey, my hair doesn’t grow.”
if [x] does get another hair cur against his will. or by coercing, manipulation, bullying or anyway that is considered familiy violence, by you or other members of your family. i will be reporting this to child protection services and any agencies or professionals necessary to ensure this child abuse stops.[42]
the children were very, very traumatised, your honour. they – they didn’t want to go back to their mum. they – they were saying that they hated their mum. they said they don’t want to go back to the [house]. i was trying to counsel them. i got them to call the kids helpline to try and counsel them.
because i was concerned for the boys’ wellbeing.
i was hoping that, yes, it – she could maybe try and empathise with the – with the boys.
no. taking the boys – making the report is me noticing that i – i believe that – it’s – it’s an ongoing thing and it’s not a one-off thing, and it’s repeated all the time, and it’s really affecting [x]'s – really affecting [x]. he’s – he’s – he’s getting into fights at school, he’s – he’s getting bullied at school.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of their parents, and any other relevant characteristics of the children
if the children are aboriginal children or torres strait islander children, their right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to the children, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the children’s parents
as a result of the father overholding the children, i wait for long periods of time, with little or no information regarding when or where the children will be available for changeover. i am unable to leave my home to work, study, attend to household errands or plan for any social outings on changeover days. if compulsory work or educational commitments coincide with changeover days, due to the uncertainty that the father's behaviour creates, i get extremely stressed. i have to manage that stress as well as meet my responsibilities. i find that i am distracted and unable to fully focus on my work or study. ... the situation has become so bad that i have had to take a leave of absence from [work], change jobs at the end of 2021, and alter the way in which i schedule aspects of my personal life and the children's appointments or extracurricular activities to mitigate the chance of overholding impacting on both mine and the children's lives. i have experienced significant levels of emotional distress and my physical health has also been impacted. i suffer with frequent colds and viral infections. my [medical condition] and associated condition has become unstable. i feel a deep sense of despair that the father ignores the orders which perpetuates the conflict between us.[43]
any family violence involving the children or a member of their family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the children or a member of their family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the children
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility
living and spending time arrangements
they’re both old enough to understand that, which would be really, really beneficial, especially for [x], especially for their routine. like, their routine is really important. and once they get into a set routine week about it’s – the benefits will outweigh any benefits of the father being with them or having a weekend with them where it’s – you know, a week would have a – a routine with the father, a routine with the mother, they would have a meaningful relationship with the mother. they would have a meaningful relationship with the father.
