item 6: sale proceeds of town m house
item 7: monies in the name of the children controlled by the wife
item 8: wife’s legal costs
counsel for the husband: in your financial statement filed six weeks ago, you set out that your mortgage was $164,647.00, and today, six weeks later, your position to the court is that your mortgage is now $210,556.00. what’s happened to the $46,000.00 or there abouts in the last six weeks? witness: in the last six weeks, i’ve paid legal fees to my lawyer, i guess, so i put money into her trust account for barrister fees and the remaining amount is redraw across to my credit card over the last month to pay that account, and the remaining $500.00 would be the mortgage package fee that’s just come through. counsel for the husband: of that amount, how much has been used to pay your lawyers? witness: so, i’ve paid all family law close to $14,000.00 and put in trust for my barrister $25,000.00. counsel for the husband: and prior to the $14,000 you paid your solicitor, you’ve previously paid solicitors’ accounts, haven’t you? witness: yes. counsel for the husband: and when you paid solicitors’ accounts previously, was that drawn from the mortgage? witness: yes, most of the time. or actually, i think all of the time from memory. if that’s my only source of income is that redraw facility, then it would’ve definitely come from that. judge dickson: just to follow that up, am i entitled to assume then that all the costs referred to in your costs notice, all of those funds would have come from the mortgage redraw because that’s your only source of income? witness: yes, outside of my um salary, my fortnightly salary.[37]
item 12: monies advanced by the wife’s parents  the funds were advanced unsecured, (2) no interest has been paid in relation to the funds, (3) there was no evidence of any call at any time by the

children. specifically, the “ff trust” in relation to education costs paid by mr and mrs h for and on behalf of their grandchildren. the recording of interfamily financial payments is a prudent and sensible practise so as to minimise the potential for future disputation, (6) the language used by mr h in his affidavit makes it clear that the repayment of the funds is nothing more than a mere possibility rather than a certainty that this will occur during his lifetime, and (7) the husband was not a party to the loan agreement which the wife now seeks to bring to account in the balance sheet as a joint liability.   no interest has been paid in relation to the funds, (3) there was no evidence of any call at any time by the wife’s parents for all or part of the funds to be repaid, (4)
