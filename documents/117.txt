summary
applicant’s case
at the commencement of our relationship [mr crisanti] made me sign a document identifying him as my landlord. i felt powerless to refuse his demands and so i signed that document. ... [mr crisanti] demanded i continued to receive centrelink payments throughout our relationship.[2]
i only left the family home with the intention of permanently separating from [mr crisanti] on 3 may 2018. that was when i finally summoned sufficient courage to permanently leave [mr crisanti].[3]
my financial circumstances are extremely dire and i am struggling to get by from week to week. the financial statement sworn by me and filed contemporaneously herewith is true and correct.[4]
mr c  he is a painter and in or about 2005, he was engaged by the applicant and the respondent to paint a property where they lived in town k,[8] (b) subsequently, in about 2006, he was again engaged to paint a new home they were having built in town g,[9] (c) the town g job took about eight weeks,[10] (d) during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11]   subsequently, in about 2006, he was again engaged to paint a new home they were having built in town g,[9] (c) the town g job took about eight weeks,[10] (d) during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11]   the town g job took about eight weeks,[10] (d) during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11]   during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11]
it was clear to me that [ms egan] and [mr crisanti] were in a domestic relationship given the way in which they both went about planning and building the town g property and instructing me of their requirements.[12]
...observed both female and male clothing being stored in the walk-in robe. the ensuite was also a shared area and it was clear and obvious to me that [ms egan] and [mr crisanti] were a couple and that they were cohabitating in that property together and sharing the master bedroom.[13]
... razorblades ... toothpaste, different toothbrushes, ladies makeup, men’s shaving gear.... it looked like there was a man and a woman sharing a bathroom. ... so there was all that stuff i had to move in order to pain this ceiling ...[14]
mr f
... i was lead to believe that they were (in a de facto relationship). ... i met [mr crisanti] back in 2008 or ’09 around the bushfire time, and they were, - i went to [ms egan]’s house with [ms l] because ... [ms egan] and [ms l] were friends, and because i was [ms l]’s partner we went up there ... and it appeared to me that they were ... living together.[19]
respondent’s counsel: but the idea that they were in a de facto relationship rather than simply living together is just something that you’re assuming, isn’t it? [mr f]: well, it just seemed to me ... [ms egan] cooked ... his dinner and ... they had conversations about going away together. they had a timeshare and they went on holidays together. i mean, that seems a bit more than just – do you know what i mean. ... and [ms egan] said that she was with [mr crisanti] when she was only 21 or something ...[20]
mr d
throughout the years i saw both of the parties on numerous occasions working on the farm. they attended [work] meetings together. they went on a bus holiday to adelaide. i paid rental when it was due to either [ms egan] or [mr crisanti].[25]
ms e
i have no doubt in my mind that they were a genuine couple and presented to our community that they were a couple. the assertion made by [mr crisanti] that [ms egan] was a nanny is ridiculous.[27]
they were in a relationship from the time i saw [ms egan] and started to speak with her at the school where my daughter went and [mr crisanti]’s son and daughter went and i even thought they were her children at the time. ... and from that time on she was very proud to say that she was his fiancé.[28]
mr b
i did show concern for [ms egan] given her extremely poor health including mental health, even taking her to medical appointments at times when she was too unwell to drive. [mr b] has misconstrued the situation while [ms egan] is seeking to take advantage of that kindness.[38]
respondent’s counsel: isn’t it fair to say that the basis of your belief about the nature of the relationship between [mr crisanti] and [ms egan] is derived, most of all, from your one-on-one counselling sessions with [ms egan]? [mr b]: yes. because it’s certainly based on my experience and also based on the ... 30-odd sessions ... that i had with her over that period of time. i would say that she certainly believed, without question, that they were in a de facto relationship.[39]
judge bender: but the discussion you had with ... [mr crisanti]... and he was speaking glowingly ... what was the context of that discussion? where were you? how did it come up? [mr b]: well, it was with my wife and i. we were having, i think afternoon tea. might have been even around at their house. and just visiting socially. and [mr crisanti] was quite, as i say, glowing in his praise of [ms egan]’s work ethic, even to the point of helping him on the job as an [tradesman]. running cables through cramped spaces in rooves and that sort of thing. i can’t recall him ever mentioning her role as a nanny. judge bender: how many discussions would you have had with [mr crisanti], either with [ms o] or just [mr crisanti]? [mr b]: ...it’s hard to put a quantity on, but five to ten possibly.[40]
respondent’s case
initially ... the applicant used the study as a bedroom. after approximately two years, the applicant began to sleep in the same bedroom as me. i then used the study for work. ... the physical aspect of the relationship was short-lived. thereafter the applicant continued to sleep in the same bed as me. we just slept beside one another with our backs turned. it did not worry me that the applicant was sleeping with me. we just didn’t touch each other.[48] at the [u street] property, the applicant again slept in the same bed as me. there were not sufficient bedrooms for the applicant to have her own room. there were no sexual relations between us.[49] at the [town v] property, we slept in the same bedroom but once again, there were no sexual relations between us. the applicant and i had a lot of altercations at the [town v] property.[50] whereas the ([town g]) property initially comprised one bedroom, i then built extensions there, so that the property comprises three bedrooms plus a study. initially the applicant and i slept in the same bedroom at the (([town g]) property. this was due to the property only comprising one bedroom and bathroom. when the rest of the house was built, i then moved into one of the other bedrooms and slept separate from the applicant.[51]
because she had an ensuite there and she had a wardrobe and she was comfortable. ... that’s why. i respected her. ... and she slept there with her dog too in the bed.[53]
no. i preferred to go down to that room. it’s closer to my office and away from her.[54]
from 1 january 2007, i regarded myself as living in a property with an enemy, and i was periodically very frightened for my safety. none of the former aspects of shared living remained, either in terms of sharing a bed, shopping, cooking or cleaning.
mr p
ms q
mr s
applicant’s counsel: ... could you, from your observations, see any reason why he would need a housekeeper? [mr s]: yes, he’s a hardworking [tradesman], and it’s a large house, and ... i didn’t see anything unusual about that [ms egan] was there as the housekeeper and gave her accommodation on that basis. ... applicant’s counsel: did you see anything justifying why [mr crisanti] needed a housekeeper? [mr s]: yes, because she was a good cook, and he probably got used to having good meals cooked for him, his house kept, while he was off working in his profession.[58]
there was never anything showed that they were a couple or had any affection towards one another at all, other than ... what i was told, that she was the housekeeper, and that was it.[60]
ms r
mr w’s evidence
other evidence relied upon
engagement
respondent: i broke off my engagement straightaway, within a month, after she told me of all her past and the events ... applicant’s counsel: ...and how did you break it off, was it a formal announcement to the world? respondent: i just said ... that’s the end, finished. applicant’s counsel: yes but just to my client or to everyone else? respondent: ... everybody yes. applicant’s counsel: ...so you communicated that to everybody? respondent: yes i did. all my friends, my family, yes.[67]
applicant’s role in the respondent’s mother’s funeral
applicant’s counsel: but you knew the pamphlet was being passed around to everybody? respondent: i didn’t draw that up. applicant’s counsel: but you knew it was being passed around? respondent: ... what did you want me to do? send it back on the day my mum was getting buried ... is that what you wanted me to do?...i’m sorry but ... i was crying on the day. applicant’s counsel: so you didn’t do anything about it? respondent: no.[69]
applicant’s counsel: so how was she looking after your children when they’re 25, and 23 years of age. respondent: she wasn’t supposed to be with me. she was asked to leave, and she was still there. she wouldn’t leave. she had nowhere to go. i felt sorry for her. applicant’s counsel: you’re not answering my question sir respondent: i am applicant’s counsel: okay. i will ask you for the last time ... ... how do you say she was there at your mother’s funeral in 2004 caring and looking after your children? how do you say that? respondent: she wasn’t looking after my children then. she was there because she was still acting as a nanny. applicant’s counsel: but a nanny for whom? respondent: she was acting as a nanny. she was my nanny and my housekeeper. applicant’s counsel: okay. so she was a housekeeper at this stage, was she? respondent: she was a housekeeper because she wouldn’t leave home, and we had come to an agreement – like i told you the last time, we had come to an agreement that if she kept the house clean and tidy, she could stay there, because she had nowhere to go. she was fighting with her family and had no friends. you may see that in one of the affidavits.[71]
applicant’s counsel: ... isn’t that strange? do you find it strange [mr crisanti],– at this stage, my client’s not a nanny, she’s a housekeeper – that she’s at your grandmother’s funeral in 2004 and giving a eulogy as a family member? [mr p]: i find it strange yes. but that’s ... dad’s nature was just to keep ... her there, and ... i would ask him many times why she’s still here, we’re adults now. and he had a deal with her, i guess and ... they were both happy ... doing their own ... living their own lives but in the same house ...[72]
the age newspaper article   crisanti], who owns the property where the [accident occurred], said he thought something might have gone wrong when they heard a noise over their house. ... [ms egan] said it was lucky that the [object didn’t] crash into a nearby construction site ... (emphasis added)[73]
applicant’s use of the name crisanti
applicant’s counsel: [mr crisanti] when did you become aware that she was telling everybody that you were a married couple? ... respondent: always ... well for the last 20 years? applicant’s counsel: well, 20 or 29 years? respondent: no for the last 20 years. applicant’s counsel: well what about before that? respondent: well, she just accepted her role and that was it applicant’s counsel: you got engaged in ...? respondent: until we got ... engaged then she started telling – after that, she told everybody we were ... a married couple. applicant’s counsel: so since 1993? respondent: ... to her friends which were unknown to me.[76]
applicant’s name on utility bills
ivo obtained by the respondent
offer of life interest
i did not say i was going to buy her a property. i was going to buy a property and put her in there as a tenant. ... for life because i felt sorry for her and the other reasons she wouldn’t leave home, and i thought this might have been something she would accept. ... but she denied that and she says, ‘why should i leave? i’ve got a house here’.[82]
her duties of nanny had expired. i asked her to leave. she would not leave, so we let it go. it arose again. i asked her to leave. she wouldn’t leave. she broke down and cried and said ‘i’ve got nobody. i’ve got no family. i’ve got not friends. i’ve got nowhere to go.’ i felt sorry for her. so she broke down and cried, as i say. i felt sorry for her and we come to an agreement that she keeps, maintains the house, keeps it clean and cooks meals and she can stay there free of rent.[83]
i just let her go. i ... felt sorry for her because of all her mental issues and i really felt sorry for her and i looked after her more than anything else. ... i’m still fairly sorry for her now. ... i still feel sorry for her and i get told off for that ...[85]
applicant’s attendance on family holidays
company m
attendance at wedding in 2016
i don’t explain to people what our situation was. all right?[86]
cards from the respondent
because she lived with us, and she looked after my children. i respect her for that, and that’s why i gave her the cards. ... and she gave me cards too.[87]
... well i’ve known [ms egan] for 30 years. and although she’s not a family member, she’s still a friend and was a part of my life as a nanny ... we gave her a christmas card or a birthday card just as i would give my next-door neighbour.[90]
photos tendered by the applicant
respondent: if my ... son came to my house with ... his daughter ... why couldn’t she cuddle the baby? applicant’s counsel: because, see, she’s a housekeeper? respondent: that’s correct. applicant’s counsel: you’re in no relationship with her? respondent: that doesn’t mean that she has got to be separate and not like kids. applicant’s counsel: so you say, despite, in your mind, that you weren’t in a relationship, she was allowed to do everything that one would expect to do as a member of the family? respondent: if she loves to hold a child, she can hold a child. i’ve got nothing against that. ... there’s no issue. she can hold whichever baby she wants.[91]
applicant’s attendance at mr p 40th birthday
respondent’s relationships with other women
applicant’s counsel: when do you say that you were told that they were in a de facto relationship, from when to when? [ms e]: at the very beginning when ...[ms egan] was in her twenties. applicant’s counsel: ... do you know ... how long that lasted for? [ms e]: probably, two months – two weeks. i don’t know. not very long. it was very short. applicant’s counsel: yes. and? [ms e]: apparently there was, like, he cared about her but he was never in love with her. i’m sure he cared about her.[95]
no never...why would i? ... he told me years before she was in a separate room. the house is a big house ... she’s on one side of the house. he’s on the other side of the house, and he ... had a padlock on his door as well because she threatened to kill him.[97]
applicant leaving the town g property
respondent’s counsel you had been expelled from [mr crisanti]’s home by the police on 3 may 2018? applicant: because [mr crisanti] made a lie. respondent’s counsel you were expelled from the home by victoria police on 3 may 2018, do you accept that? applicant: that one i will have to think about, i’m sorry. ... respondent’s counsel ... that you left the home against your wishes on 3 may 2018 because victoria police insisted that you leave? applicant: i didn’t leave the home, i was falsely kicked out of my home.[98]
... that was false allegations [mr crisanti] had made ... ... i went to the police station and they told me the next day i have to go to the magistrates’ (court) in [suburb ah] and it was the magistrate in [suburb ah] who apologised to me and said ‘i’m sorry [ms egan], i have to correspond with family law’ and i got evicted through the magistrate of [suburb ah] not the police. because [mr crisanti] made a lie, your honour.[99]
application for bush fire recovery payment
well, you know, i read a little bit of his affidavit, and then it just made me sick, so i didn’t read ... any more of it, to be quite honest.[102]
if that was the $1,000 granted for the bushfire relief, i went with [mr crisanti] to the place in [suburb aj]. so we could both receive the $1,000 bond.[103]
judge: did you sign this form? applicant i don’t recall ... doing that your honour... judge: where in any material filed by you had you refuted that you were the author of this document? ... where in any affidavit filed by you after the swearing of this affidavit did you say – i didn’t do that. it wasn’t me. it must have been someone else. because i assume that’s what you’re now saying. applicant no. well, i’m just saying that that’s not usually how my signature is your honour. judge: no i’m not asking you that, madam. i’m asking you did you fill in this form? applicant: i could have filled in – i did fill in a form, back in the bushfire days for the government grant of $1,000, but i don’t know if it was this form, your honour.[104]
well at the time, my partner, [mr crisanti] was with me.[105]
respondent’s counsel: so were you telling centrelink the truth? applicant: no. when you’re under duress and you’re in a 29 year relationship and you do a forgery. ... respondent’s counsel i’m asking you ... did you lie to centrelink? applicant: under duress, yes. [106]
applicable legal principles
working out if persons have a relationship as a couple
... it is also unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal ... to decide whether ... a finding of a de facto relationship could be made absent any of the indicia to which the section refers. of course to be a ‘couple’ it is necessary for there to be a mutual intention to have such a relationship. the effect of sub-s(5) on the determination of whether parties have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis is to import into it the understanding that a person can ... maintain two simultaneous relationships. that one of the parties asserted to have been in a de facto relationship was, at the same time, in another relationship, whether de facto or married, is a matter to be taken into account when considering the circumstances of the relationship and the indicia in s 4aa(2). however the fundamental question remains to be determined and now we turn to that. ... we must observe, however, that the appellant’s emphasis on the words ‘living together’ imports a somewhat artificial focus. the matter for determination was not solely whether the parties were “living together” at the relevant time. the court must find that they were ‘as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.’
86 de facto relationships that broke down before commencement (1) subject to item 86a, parts viiiab and viiib and subsection 114(2a) of the new act do not apply in relation to a de facto relationship that broke down before commencement.
