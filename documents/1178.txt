what is a contravention?
chronology of relevant events
it’s not in [z]’s best interests to attend anymore [sic] than a short visit until he has received support from a mental health professional, this is expected to occur soon which hopefully will mean he can start attending.   that if z was seeking to spend time with the father it was a positive sign but that it remained a matter for the father if he thought it was premature or likely to be problematic prior to returning to family therapy with ms c, and (b) that the independent children’s lawyer thought that if z was wanting to spend time with the father that it should be encouraged and if not, the father ran the risk of z forming the view that z was being rejected.   that the independent children’s lawyer thought that if z was wanting to spend time with the father that it should be encouraged and if not, the father ran the risk of z forming the view that z was being rejected.   that the father’s relationship with z requires therapeutic support, (b) that the father’s relationship with z remains problematic in that z’s behaviour towards his father can be unduly aggressive and that the father even meeting with z can give rise to physical aggression by z towards his father, and (c) that the children report matters back to their mother that may not truly reflect all of the circumstances as to what has occurred on occasions.   that the father’s relationship with z remains problematic in that z’s behaviour towards his father can be unduly aggressive and that the father even meeting with z can give rise to physical aggression by z towards his father, and (c) that the children report matters back to their mother that may not truly reflect all of the circumstances as to what has occurred on occasions.   that the children report matters back to their mother that may not truly reflect all of the circumstances as to what has occurred on occasions.   the father explicitly giving the children the choice to attend to spend time with their father, (b) y displaying ongoing distress in relation to attending to see his father including, throwing things, screaming, crying and not sleeping, which the mother attributed to the father having “hacked off” y’s hair (which had occurred in mid-2023) in circumstances where there was no “consent”, (c) y being scared to attend school, (d) x still being asleep at 12 noon, and (e) the father needing to meet y “where he needed you to”.   y displaying ongoing distress in relation to attending to see his father including, throwing things, screaming, crying and not sleeping, which the mother attributed to the father having “hacked off” y’s hair (which had occurred in mid-2023) in circumstances where there was no “consent”, (c) y being scared to attend school, (d) x still being asleep at 12 noon, and (e) the father needing to meet y “where he needed you to”.   y being scared to attend school, (d) x still being asleep at 12 noon, and (e) the father needing to meet y “where he needed you to”.   x still being asleep at 12 noon, and (e) the father needing to meet y “where he needed you to”.   the father needing to meet y “where he needed you to”.   that faced with resistance from the children in coming into his care, the father resorts to asking the children as to whether they are coming or as to whether they wish to come and the father thereafter does not persist, and (b) that handovers take place in the presence of the mother who remains and does not leave the children in the father’s care nor direct them to go with him although it is his time to spend with the children.   that handovers take place in the presence of the mother who remains and does not leave the children in the father’s care nor direct them to go with him although it is his time to spend with the children.

consideration
“where an order under this part or section 112ad provides for a person to have access to a child, a person shall not, without just cause or excuse, hinder or prevent the first-mentioned person from obtaining access to the child in accordance with the order or interfere with the access to the child that the first-mentioned person is entitled to in accordance with the order.”
a party’s subjective view of the rights and wrongs of a decision cannot be relied on as “just cause or excuse” or “reasonable cause”. evidence of changed circumstances or of matters not considered when the order was made might be.[17]
on the one hand, it is quite clear that they must not do anything to prevent access taking place. as put by [ms f], they must do nothing physically or emotionally to spoil the access, they must have the child prepared physically for the access. on the other hand, it seems clear that they are not obliged force the child go on access when the child does not wish to do so. the question that does not appear to be dealt with in any authority to which i have been referred is the test to be applied when the child expresses a wish not to go with the person seeking to exercise access. is there some obligation on the custodial parents to take some positive action in relation to this attitude of the child? in the absence of authority, my view is that what persons in the position of the defendants are obliged to do is to do whatever is reasonable to bring about compliance with the court order. if in a particular case in all the circumstances would be reasonable to take positive steps to bring about some change in the attitude wishes of the child, then i think persons in the position of the defendants are obliged by the order to take those steps.[19]  ould have to have parked her car, turned off the engine and told each daughter to alight. if refusal then ensued she then needs to herself alight the car, open the door for the children, if necessary unbuckle a seat belt and verbally sternly require the girls to get out of the car. any refusal should then result in a request to the father to encourage the children and standing away whilst this happened. stopping but not parking the car and not turning off the engine and then quickly driving off is not a reasonable attempt. even if the driving off follows a verbal request from the child.
then there is the following passage which, although lengthy, is worthy of being repeated and it is as follows: i have already made reference to the implied obligation of the custodian to take reasonable steps to ensure that the access stipulated in an order takes place. words and actions have meaning in context and affect. it is not a sufficient discharge of custodian’s obligations, express or implied, to point to words and actions and to say, in effect: “you see i tried. but the child does not want to go,” and thereafter to figuratively fold their arms as if it were an end of the matter. theirs is an active role with an obligation to positively encourage access. it is not a discharge of their duty to set up access to fail. that is to say, it is not sufficient to make a token effort at compliance by the utterance of a few phrases which, in the main, are designed to impart to the child not positive encouragement to go on access, but to convey the burden on both the child and the custodian of compliance with the obligation.
