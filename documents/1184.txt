reasons for judgment
judge glass:
new parenting orders sought
changes in circumstances relied on
ms b  reported that she has witnessed many disputes between [mr yasin] and [ms b]. [x] once recounted when [ms b] yelled at [mr yasin]: "you just don't care about me. you treat me like i am your servant. you are so selfish and irresponsible. " [x] then said to me: "i hope they don 't end up in divorce". [x] reported another dispute between [mr yasin] and [ms b]. they were screaming and yelling loudly at each other while [mr yasin] was driving. [ms b] was sitting in the front passenger seat and [x] was seated in the back with her half-sisters. [ms b] was so upset that she opened the car door at the traffic light, she got out of the car and started walking away from the car towards the traffic. [x] said: "dad quickly parked the car, got out and went to follow [ms b] but he lost track of her". [x] then said: "dad and i got out of the car, and we went to look for [ms b]". there was another instance when [x] reported that she witnessed her stepmother banging her head against a wall in frustration. she said: "dad had to step in to stop her". [x] said: "both the kids were crying, and she felt afraid".[11]
... told me that she is completely accustomed to the current living arrangements, that she enjoys living in two houses, is completely comfortable moving between houses, does not find it difficult, enjoys the relationship with her father, her stepmother and her younger sister, and is looking forward to her soon to be born sibling. [x] told me that she has an excellent relationship with her stepmother, that this person treats her kindly and treats her well, that there have not been any difficulties between them and that she enjoys the time spent with her.[14]
... told me she has no problems, that it is actually better that her parents had divorced because so many good things have come as a consequence, and specifically, she told me that she now has a sister, that she gets to live in 2 houses, that she enjoys the individual time with her mother, has a special relationship with her father, and that her parents being separate means that they do not have conflict. [x] told me that she likes having two rooms, two families, and that there is nothing about the arrangement that she finds difficult.[15]
extra-curricular activities
the parents shall do all things to ensure that the children attends any extra-curricular activities that she is currently enrolled in and each parent is restrained from enrolling the child in any additional extra-curricular activities outside of that parent's time with the child, unless agreed otherwise between the parents.[17]
international travel
parental conflict
i would encourage the court to embrace in totality the likelihood that the problems that have existed will continue, and that as a consequence, there is a high risk that the fallout for [x] will be substantial, although the indications are that thus-far she has managed to avoid the negative consequences thereof.[23]
i draw attention to the contents of my previous family report, and specifically the description of [mr yasin] and [ms huda]'s relationship as being highly conflicted, that they had experienced significant problems from the very outset of the relationship.[24] ... having again interviewed [mr yasin] and [ms huda], having read the sms and email communication shared by the parties, and having again spoken with [x], it is very clearly my view that at the most fundamental level, their relationship has not changed, that their conflict remains prominent, that their lack of conflict resolution remains conspicuous by its absence and that both escalate by working on an external locus of control, that is, that they explain their behaviour and justify their actions on the basis of how they perceive to have been treated by the other.[25]
