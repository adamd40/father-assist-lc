the relevant legal principles
these rights, and the right of freedom of mobility of a parent, only defer to the paramount consideration of a child’s best interests where those interests would be so adversely affected as to justify such interference, and then the interference is legitimate only to the extent that it is necessary to avoid such adverse effects.   the best interests of the children are the paramount, but not the sole consideration, (b) the person seeking to move does not need to provide compelling reasons for the relocation sought, (c) the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the children’s best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the person seeking to move does not need to provide compelling reasons for the relocation sought, (c) the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the children’s best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the children’s best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.   the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the parent who wishes to relocate.
in some cases, the determination of “best interests” may well mean that one party’s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child’s “best interests” being served by orders which do not give one parent “optimal” arrangements or outcomes.
a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.   the objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by: (a) ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.
parental responsibility
the considerations pursuant to section 60cc of the act   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
primary considerations
meaningful relationship
meaningful relationships with both parents are critical to the children's development of positive attachment relationships. attachment allows children to develop the secure base necessary to explore their world, relate to others, and regulate their emotions adaptively.
elevations in risk appeared to primarily relate to her capacity to continue supporting a relationship between the children and their father and avoid exposing them to adult issues and/or conflict.
risks to the children
the father’s alcohol use
the father’s road rage   believed that her father had difficulty regulating his anger at times. she indicated that he has a history of becoming upset while driving, and she has been fearful that he will ram another vehicle or get into a physical fight with another driver. she described her father as having a loud and deep voice, that she finds frightening when directed at her. she denied that he had ever physically hurt her.

reasonable practicability
ability to meet the children’s needs
an extended block of time also allows them to develop deeper relationships with each parent without feeling like they must constantly adjust to different living situations.

what orders are in the best interests of the children?
while moving to [region b] may have its advantages in terms of lifestyle and/or more affordable housing, it is likely that this would be offset by the children having an integrated experience across time with their mother and father. further, it would not be practical for them to have midweek time with their father. both or one parent is going to have to do a significant amount of driving, and the children will miss out on parties and social events, particularly as they enter high school. it would be in the children's best interests to reside closer to school and each parent. it is likely that if the children remained residing in the suburbs of melbourne that this would be more achievable. thus, while relocation is a matter for the court, based on the needs of the children, it would not be recommended in this instance.
