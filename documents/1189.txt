legal principles
...the registry practice of the family court of giving all applications between the same parties the same filing number cannot in our view, override the clear provisions of the family law act, that there are distinct proceedings depending on the nature of the relief claimed.
the question of whether the application is in the same proceeding or in the same cause is crucial and is determined by reference to the structure and content of the definition of ‘matrimonial cause’ in the act, the relevant parts of the act and the ...rules... that apply and, ultimately whether the proceedings may be identified as distinct because the nature of the relief claimed in them respectively is determinative.[16]
we consider that the determination of what constitutes proceedings is governed by identification of the separate causes of action on which one or more of the parties move and not by the administrative allocation of a file number to causes of action.[17]
...if breached orders are left unenforced, public confidence in the courts capacity to quell litigious disputes is undermined. the disobedience of orders inevitably involves, first, an innocent party incurring more cost and inconvenience to enforce the orders against the defaulting party, and second, the diversion of resources by the courts from other deserving disputes to entertain the enforcement applications...[23]
