[42] in many cases where an application is made for property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice by made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife. no less importantly, the express implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship... and the assumption that any adjustment of those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4),
mr cortes’ letter with the promise

mr cortes’ payments to the #...31 loan
in proceedings under this division, other than proceedings under section 90sl, the court must, as far as practicable, make such orders as will finally determine the financial relationships between the parties to the de facto relationship and avoid further proceedings between them.
the preferred approach
[39] the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application pursuant to the provisions of section 79. that approach involves four interrelated steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (“the other factors”) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

the life insurance payment
7(b) savings of approximately $125,000, being the balance of funds received from a superannuation payout of $160,000 following the death of her partner [in] 2019. i believe she may have received some of the funds in her name directly and some as trustee for her son [e]. the respondent told me she had paid some debts from when she was living in [city h] such as phone accounts and veterinary bills. i believe she also paid out a personal load but cannot recall the details of this.
i acquired this property from a $165,000 death insurance payment from my deceased finance ([mr f]). half of this money was for my son however he was very young so i was able to access it...
mr carne. and therefore you needed some additional funds to be able to purchase the property? [ms almeer]. i did not need it. i had 175,000 i received from – which was half of my son’s and half of mine from when [mr f] passed away, and i had that money, and i was going to put it all towards the house, but [mr cortes] convinced me to put some aside so that we could move in straight away and renovate it quickly ...
his honour so you – i need you to address me on that, and then i need you to address me on the issue that’s raised in [mr cortes]’ first statement where he says that the money was – to purchase the house – was held on trust for [e]. that’s absent his current affidavit, and what do i do, legally, with the concept that it’s actually – on one version, the whole of it is [e]’s house. on the other hand, half of it is [e]’s house, and how does your client get a property settlement out of [e]’s house – or half of [e]’s house. do you follow my conundrum.

step two: section 90sm(4)(a), (b) & (c) contributions ] in each case, we consider that the point being made is that there is no principle or guideline (or, indeed, anything else emerging from s 79), that renders the direct contribution of income or capital more important – or “special” – when compared against indirect contributions and, in particular, contributions to the home or the welfare of the family.  ] if it is necessary to make the point again, and to highlight it for the purpose of this appeal, we add our endorsement to what has been made clear in the authorities referred and to the full court’s comments in [52] of hoffman, that the words of s 79 do not provide endorsement for any category of contribution related to any class of property (for example, high wealth) being, by virtue of that category or class, more valuable or important that another. in each case the contributions made by the parties must be evaluated in the context of the facts particular to that case.  ] ... all contributions must be weighed collectively and so it is an error to segment or compartmentalise the various contributions and weigh one again the remainder. [36] that principle has a counterpart in the application factors prescribed in section 75(2) or section 90sm(3) of the act. any adjustment to the parties contribution-based- entitlements should be determined inclusively after considering all relevant factors, not by aggregating incremental adjustment in respect of each relevant factor. [citations omitted]
in our view, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred in proceedings pursuant to the provisions of s 79 that moneys howsoever received by a party during the course of the parties' cohabitation, are used by that party for the benefit of the family unit. such moneys, in those circumstances, thus constitute a financial contribution by the party who received the moneys.
step three: section 90sf(3) factors
...in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue.
on our adjusted figure for the value of the parties net assets ($1,503,863), adjustment of 10% in the wife’s favour results in an increase in her entitlement of $150,386, and a corresponding reduction in the husband’s entitlement, producing a differential movement between them of $300,772 ...  7] it is also important to recall what was said in phipson & phipson [2009] famcafc 28 when the full court was dealing with another appeal from the trial judge in the present proceedings:  ] it is always important to keep in mind that an adjustment of x% for s 75(2) factors leads to a disparity in the value of property received by the parties representing 2 x x%. it is that disparity, measured in “money terms”, that requires consideration in determining whether the result is just and equitable: see campbell v kuskey [1998] famca 10, (1998) flc 92-795 at 84,928.  8] the 10% adjustment his honour made on account of s 75(2) factors has led to a disparity in favour of the wife equivalent in value to 20% of the assets. in money terms this represents $187,733 out of a total asset pool of $938,665. apart from the issues associated with the care, accommodation and maintenance of the children, the s 75(2) factors largely balanced out (save that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife would have more capital than the husband). the husband was going to have whatever responsibility remained for the care, accommodation and maintenance of j. both parties would have significant responsibility for the two younger children. it is true the wife will have the children with her about 20% more of the time than the husband, but this amounts to only a little more than 70 additional days a year. [109] in our view an assessment leading to a disparity of $187,733 in the capital/superannuation to be received by each party was outside the reasonable ambit of the trial judge’s broad discretion, even taking into account the matters found by his honour relating to the non-payment of child support in the period after the husband gave up his employment. our conclusion is sufficient to enliven appellate intervention (house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513). the appeal will therefore be allowed. ... [113] taking these matters into account, and the failure of the husband to pay child support after giving up his employment, we consider there should be a 4% adjustment for s 75(2) factors, creating a disparity of 8% between the parties – or in money terms an amount of $75,093.  9] in our view, s 79(4)(e) requires those matters to be taken into account in arriving at orders that are just and equitable as between the parties. in arriving at an appropriate assessment for those factors, a dollar value of it should be uppermost in our minds [79] and, of course, the ultimate disparity in entitlements which it might produce. that dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests in property of the parties.
