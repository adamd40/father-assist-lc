reasons for judgment
judge murdoch
introduction
background
the parties’ proposals
the evidence
the child
the parties
this binary view of family violence is outmoded and has no place in modern family law. in our view her evidence that she sought to preserve the family unit and to protect z without the involvement of these agencies was neither incredible nor inconsistent with her evidence of her history of family violence.
the lay witnesses
the family report
the legal principles  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  ] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) – something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act – the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent.
the primary considerations
meaningful relationship
...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...  2] ...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
family violence
inconsistency having thus been established, the totality of the evidence as to family violence was then evaluated as unreliable. no attempt was made to identify a core consistency in what she said. amongst other things, this approach fails to recognise how hard it is for victims of violence inflicted by a family member, who is often someone they love or on whom they rely for sustenance, to speak about what has happened. the subject matter is distressing and giving voice to what has occurred can be traumatic in itself. we cannot say strongly enough that those involved in cases such as this must bear in mind that in this setting, disclosure is a process that often requires time before a complete picture emerges.  he probative value of a particular piece of evidence should not be considered in isolation from the rest of the evidence, including the proposed evidence. this is particularly so where the court is asked to draw an inference from all of the evidence, that is to say, all of the circumstances of the matter. this is because one piece of evidence may affect the probative value of another and a number of pieces of evidence when considered together may have a probative value greater than if each is considered individually.
the father’s allegations
the mother’s allegations
the incident of late 2017
i recall feeling very upset and frightened as i spoke to the police. i said to the police: ‘i don’t want you to take any action against [the father] i just want him to stop hitting me.’[4]
the incident of mid-2020
domestic violence [...] swelling and tenderness reason for contact: injury – face .... domestic violence husband hit her a few hours ago [swelling and tenderness] bruise noted pot is crying ... advised to inform police feeling hopeless [6]
risk of abuse and/or neglect
the additional considerations
any views expressed by x
immediately said that he did not want to see his father. he agreed to talk about his school and his mother, but repeated several times that he did not wish to discuss [the father]. [14]
as in the cic, [the child] declined to talk about [the father], except to say that he did not want to see him. he declined to discuss his reasons for this when asked. when asked what [the mother] thought about him spending time with [the father], he said “mum never said anything to me”.[15]
the nature of the child’s relationship with the parties and other significant persons
she said that he has expressed anxiety about leaving [ms keefe] alone in the house. she said that he becomes fearful if someone is shouting, or even if someone simply talks loudly, and she has to explain to him that sometimes people just raise their voices. she said that he gave away his [toy] when another child shouted at him, because he was afraid of consequences of this.
so, generally, our priority is the wellbeing of children. in that interview, if it’s – and it’s their choice if they speak to us or not, if they offer a view or not. so, whilst we will encourage children to speak about things that they might be reluctant to speak about and, obviously, we have ways of trying to make children comfortable, ultimately we don’t pressure them to speak about things that they wish not to speak about.
the capacity of each parent to provide for x’s needs and their demonstrated attitude to x and the responsibilities of parenthood.
father: i know [x]. he doesn’t hate me that much that he will have this bad behaviour, but i will try my best to resolve that and build that sort of relationship. her honour: how are you going to do that on a practical basis? father: i will initially try myself to improve that relationship because i know those things which makes him happy but if there are issues, he is really very fond of his grandfather and grandmother and if needed i will try to get them here so he can spend time as well. her honour: your parents are in [country b]? father: yes, but they have a valid visa until 2025.
the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with x
financial support of x
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances
quite low and that his expectation that they might resume a relationship were quite unrealistic and likely to cause distress to [x] if he was placed in that situation.
the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with a parent
whether it would be preferable to make an order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
discussion and disposition
parental responsibility
adjournment and family therapy
time with orders
...suffer insecurity, fear, unhappiness, anxiety and hypervigilance from witnessing abusive behaviour of a parent. such effects present a threat to their emotional development. probably the worst danger to children is the role model that a violent parent provides which can lead to children themselves coming to suffer the serious social disability of using violence in their dealings with other people including those they love. such a disability can destroy the most intimate relationships and bring the person into conflict with other people, the police and the law...
if [ms keefe’s] account of family violence is found to have veracity, ongoing contact with [mr chabon] is likely to place [x] at risk of exposure to further aggression and violence perpetrated by [mr chabon] and of being subjected to harsh parenting practises, such as physical aggression and an intolerance of age appropriate behaviours. in this case it is recommended that [x] spend no time with [mr chabon].[24]
this evidence was confirmed by the court child expert during the course of her oral evidence. it was not successfully challenged and i accept it.   chabon’s] suggestion that he was asked to do anger management and men’s behaviour change courses due to [x’s] views, rather than the allegations of family violence, may suggest an inability or unwillingness to reflect on his own behaviours and the impacts of such behaviours on [ms keefe] and [x].[25]
having said that, if your client does not intend to participate in the "taking responsibility" course in accordance with the orders, i do not say that any non-compliance should hold up the listing of this matter for final hearing. in my view, ultimately it will form part of the evidence before the court and the parties may make submissions to the court as to what (if any) inferences should be drawn from the father's participation or non-participation.
counsel: you’re asking for there to be no contact at all between the father and [x], no face-to-face contact, no telephone contact, nothing? mother: yes. counsel: how long do you say that should be the case for? mother: like i can’t say anything now because he is growing and i don’t know for how long he will feel fear inside. maybe he needs some time to – i can’t say anything now for how long. counsel: okay, but you’re not asking for two or three years, you’re asking for an order until he’s 18, is that right? mother: like, i think that’s the best time when he confident and he can do – counsel: correct me if i’m wrong, but i got the impression from some of the answers you gave to mr fantin in his questions that if [x] was okay with seeing his father you’d be okay with it as well? mother: yes if he feels okay then it’s okay for me unless he is have [inaudible] and no stress and tension. ... counsel why are you asking the court to make orders for no contact? tell us in your own words please? mother: it’s only because for [x’s] safety and for [x]. ... counsel his safety from what? mother: like, he feel safe and he feel confident, he don’t stress – counsel no, you said it’s for [x’s] safety, i want to ask you, his safety from what? mother: like as he feels scared from his father... so like if he feel safe, then he can. counsel are you saying that the only reason you want no contact is because he’s saying he’s scared of his father? mother: yeah he’s not feeling safe and he’s scared from him.
so, there are advantages to a child having contact with a parent, obviously. it’s important for a child to be aware of their – their identify and their heritage. if they can have a positive relationship with a parent that – that is a – a good and useful thing. in this particular case, what we know, that a relationship with a perpetrator of coercive and controlling violence can have a negative impact on a child’s mental health. it can lead to them having – having distorted and concerning views of relationships as they grow up and it can have serious negative effects. also, the lack of insight that [mr chabon] showed during our interviews in regard to understanding how difficult that a reunion might be for [x] and being able to consider ways that he might need to repair that relationship suggested to me that it’s unlikely that that would be a positive relationship for [x].
