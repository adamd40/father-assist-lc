reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
children who are exposed to intense levels of conflict/violence often develop heightened sensory/emotional responses if re-exposed to aggression, conflict and intense emotion, thus reinforcing their anxieties that their world is unsafe. they may also have poorer longer-term outcomes in respect to their emotional/mental health, cognitive and emotional development, learning, peer relationships, coping mechanisms, and overall capacity to thrive. [x] may also be sensitively attuned to and impacted by any residual and/or renewed anxieties and fears experienced by [ms slade] because she is his primary carer.[8]
both parties alleged that the other has been the instigator/perpetrator of the violence between them and they have acted only in self-defence or when feeling emotionally pressured because of the other's behaviour.[9]
pending the judgment delivery, commencing monday 4 september 2023, the father will spend time with the child each monday from 9.00am to 3.00pm with the first 3 hours to take place at [b venue] at [c street, suburb d] with the handover into the father’s care to occur at [b venue] and the handover at the end of the father’s time to occur at [suburb e] police station.[16]
while [mr marshman] did not present as being as attuned to or prioritising of [x’s] needs as did [ms slade], he conveyed that he dearly loves him, is committed to being significantly involved in his life, and has different strengths/gifts to offer. the pace at which time- spending is now increased is likely to challenge his expectations/wishes and cause him frustration, which he may require support in managing in a constructive manner. he conveyed a limited understanding of [x’s] developmental needs, including the emotional/psychological demands associated with him separating from [ms slade] to spend increasing amounts of time with him in what will initially be an unfamiliar environment.[17]
both parents identified that in moving forward, their main concerns relate to a generalised mistrust/unknowing of what the other may do to cause further trouble/drama, rather than concrete concerns regarding further physical violence and their own safety. family violence is not considered a risk factor while the current injunctions/restraints remain in place and the parents don’t have substantial renewed contact.[18]   marshman] would benefit greatly by receiving support to develop his broader parenting awareness/knowledge and skills-base in areas such as the care requirements of a three year old regarding routine/sleep/diet, and how to recognise the signs that a child is experiencing separation anxiety and support them.[20]
the parties have each indicated a willingness to undertake such counselling and, in this context, the icl has designated a number of courses which she believes will assist mr marshman.[21]
a realistic, optimal outcome for [x] at this point in time would be that through spending increasing time with his father at a pace he can manage, they (he and [mr marshman]) will forge a more trusting/involved relationship, that the parents will each separately engage with a psychologist/counsellor to address their issues and improve their co-parenting relations in order to communicate appropriately about child-related matters, and [mr marshman] will seek to further develop his parenting understandings/skills.[22]
background
in or around november 2021 i insisted that the father and i separate. he pleaded with me to give him another chance, and that he would sell the [business] so that he could return to work and contribute to the household expenses. we agreed that he could remain living in my house so that the child could have both parents under the same roof, and that he would pay half the household bills and do half of the housework. i also asked the father to sign paperwork with centrelink to ensure that my parenting payments would not be cut off once the father started working in the paid workforce. he refused to do so and kept insisting that i give him another chance in the relationship. i told the father that we could continue to live separated under the same roof, and that we could see how things worked out between us. the father claimed that it would be fraudulent if l claimed centrelink benefits whilst we were both living under the same roof.[23]  .]2018 - domestic abuse offence - police were called in relation to a domestic disturbance. on arrival police established that [mr marshman] and [ms slade] had become involved in a heated verbal argument over their finances. during argument, [ms slade] reportedly tried to leave the house in an attempt to de-escalate, with [mr marshman] reportedly attempting to prevent her from doing so as he wanted to continue arguing. whilst [ms slade] was trying to leave the house she reportedly slapped [mr marshman]to the right side of his face, and then whilst trying to close front door has caused [damage to the door]. [ms slade] managed to leave house, and then called for police mediation from her car down the street. no visible injuries to [mr marshman] only soreness. police noted that [mr marshman] did not call police or want any intervention. in a follow up with [mr marshman], he stated that he and [ms slade] had discussed the issues and that he believed they had resolved them. [mr marshman] stated he knew he did the wrong thing by stopping [ms slade] from leaving, and that he knew that was what one of them should do. [mr marshman] advised that they had been to a counselling session [...] and that he thinks things had been better since then.
i really cant take this anymore. dealing with you is exhausting whst ever. yea i explode and being a bitch again fine you want to talk and me listen even if you say what i am not agree with but when i start talk then you not agree what i am saying then you intrupe me i have to hang up 3 times i told you we better don’t talk now but you keep going ok i will not come home and you can think or believe what you want over one thing i said about the dogs you need to fix your attitude. i cant take it anymore i hqve been doing most of the house work taking the dogs out everyday before we move here. you’ve been only been doing it for 2 mo ths and you’re already giving me attitude i really cant take it anymore [mr marshman] you want me to hit you again coz you keep defending yourself sorry i didn’t meant this i am just exhausted emotionally and need help[33]  .]2019 - domestic abuse non offence – [ms slade] attended a police station to seek some advice about domestic abuse. [ms slade] stated she had been in a relationship with [mr marshman] for about 3 years. she moved over from [country s] 17 years ago and met him in adelaide. she has no other friends or relatives here. they had no children together at time of reporting, they co-own a [business]. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] antagonizes her sometimes, which leads to her becoming very frustrated. [ms slade] advised that this might happen once every couple of weeks, however the behaviour had escalated in the last few months. [ms slade] stated that about a year ago, [mr marshman’s] taunting became so bad that she hit him to the face. police were called, attending patrols advised the parties consider counselling. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] did not want to attend counselling and that they stopped trying to work through the relationship. [ms slade] stated that today at home a verbal altercation ensued over minor issues. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] was very rude and they were both saying they were 'on the edge'. [mr marshman] reportedly stormed off and grabbed the cash for the [business], at which point [ms slade] slapped him across the face. [ms slade] stated that she feels on-edge all the time, and is having other life problems. she stated that she didn't want to hit [mr marshman] but stated that she just loses control sometimes. [ms slade] advised that she sometimes hits herself instead, hits her head against the wall or wardrobe. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] had hit her once after she slapped him. [ms slade] stated that [ms marshman] subjected her to ongoing psychological abuse and taunting. [ms slade] stated that she was at a loss and didn't know what to do or where to turn. she had no support in sa and did not want to return to [country s]. police made a follow up call with [ms slade], in which she stated that a lot had happened since she reported, and that things were improving. [ms slade] advised that both her and her husband have endured family tragedy and business stresses, both at their [business] and through her own employment [...]. [ms slade] explained that she had left her job and planned to spend more time at their [business]. [ms slade] explained that she and [mr marshman] had talked a lot this week and examined what their stresses were. [ms slade] had been seeing her gp and is now on a mh plan and on prescribed anti-depressants. she indicated that her stress levels had already reduced now that she has finished her job as this was her primary cause of stress. she added that maybe financial worries would now arise but so far things were much better. police offered further supports/ links, however [ms slade] declined. contact details provided for further assistance/ advice.
the evidence  slade] conveyed that given her background as previously described wherein she assumed responsibility for her own survival/well-being and was independent from a very young age, she has a low tolerance for feeling disempowered or used by others, commenting, ‘i’m not a woman [...] in [country q], i’m not the type of person to be controlled’. she acknowledged there were times when she became extremely angry and retaliatory, commenting, ‘i’d get up and shove him back to show him you can’t do that to me, another time i scratched the hell out of him’. she asserted that in retrospect, she now believes there were times [mr marshman] manipulated her into reacting in order to create a narrative that she was abusing him. [ms slade] conveyed she is unembarrassed by her reactions, believing she was entitled to respond as she did even though this contributed to an escalating cycle of conflict and their current impasse. she said in the end, she was less invested in their relationship surviving and just wanted to ‘get out’.[38]   shared care arrangement requires a higher level of cooperation and goodwill between parents to manage/coordinate the many practical aspects involved. as previously noted, the parties presented as having continued high levels of mistrust of each other and a reasonable risk of re-engaging in conflict should they come into regular contact again. [ms slade] conveyed a more realistic understanding that [x’s] time with his father should be incrementally increased. ... she suggested that when unsupervised contact commences, it should initially occur at a public facility such as a dedicated play centre/café which replicates the environment of the ‘contact centre’ where [x] has recently been used to seeing his father. [ms slade] is also likely to be more reassured if unsupervised contact commences in this way, which in turn will support [x] to feel confident and thereby to separate from her with greater ease. [ms slade’s] proposal that a third party should be present at changeovers (such as at a police station or other public venue) is realistic given the parties’ history of conflict, relative non-resolution of their relationship dynamics and respective, on-going concerns. as previously noted, further occurrences of overt conflict with [x] present will potentially negatively impact his emotional/psychological/cognitive health and development.[41]

they are terrified and simultaneously come to accept it as an expected part of life, they may learn that violence is acceptable behaviour and an integral part of intimate relationships, or that violence and fear can be used to exert control over family members, they may suffer significant emotional trauma from fear, anxiety, confusion, anger, helplessness and disruption in their lives, they may have higher levels of aggression than children who do not have that exposure, and they may suffer from higher anxiety, more behaviour problems and lower self-esteem than children not exposed to violence. clinical profiles for children who witness domestic violence include post-traumatic play, diminished ability to regulate affect in the forms of hyper-arousal, numbness, emotional constriction, a low frustration threshold, nightmares and other sleep disturbances, aggressive behaviours, intense and multiple fears, regression in developmental achievements, and disturbances in peer relations.[53]
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.[57]
...it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children’s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children’s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s ability to care for the children.
whilst parental responsibility is vaguely defined, some insight into what is needed from a parent can be seen in s 65dac(3) which provides that if both parents have that responsibility, they are taken to be required to consult about parenting issues and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision. it will again be remembered that the focus of the objects and principles in this act is on joint parenting.[73]  s a broad concept as described in s 61b and that task covers many things. parents are expected jointly to endeavour to promote their children’s development by ensuring they have the greatest potential in adulthood whilst at the same time enjoying the security of childhood they deserve.[74]
determining the best interests of the child – section 60cc
a) the primary considerations or very young children of [x’s] age, while they are unlikely to remember the actual experience/s, the impact is often expressed through behaviours such as increased clinginess and separation anxiety, disturbed sleep patterns, regressive toileting/eating habits, generalised irritability, and a hypersensitivity to raised voices/conflict. this can impact their development/learning, emotional/psychological health and overall functioning which over time, can result in inappropriate coping responses such as emotional/physical dysregulation and/or withdrawal, anxiety and depression throughout childhood, adolescence and possibly into young adulthood.[76]
it is also acknowledged that behavioural disturbances can arise for children (particularly when they are as young as [x]) when their parents are significantly estranged, as is the case for [mr marshman] and [ms slade]. this is because they (children) are exquisitely attuned to their parents’ unresolved feelings of anger, distress and fear towards one another, and of resultant tensions within the co-parenting relationship. for a child of [x’s] age, this is again typically expressed through regressive behaviours such as those noted above, especially when the child is regularly transitioning between the parents’ households.[77]
the additional considerations
a) the child’s views
b) the nature of the child’s relationship with each of his parents and significant others
c) the extent to which each of the parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to be involved in decision making and to spend time or communicate with the child ca) provision of financial support for the child
d) the effect of change
e) the practical difficulties and expense of the child spending time and communicating with each of his parents
f) the capacity of each of the child’s parents and other persons to provide for the emotional and intellectual needs of the childi) the attitude to the child and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the parties   marshman] conveyed that because [x] is comfortable playing with him within a contained/structured environment for short periods, this reflects sufficient bonding for them to progress to an arrangement of shared care. in general, [mr marshman] demonstrated limited insight in respect to [x’s] needs vis a vis his own in terms of [x’s] age/stage of development and the limited nature of their recent contact.[79]
she conveyed a level of self-reflection in respect of her own approach, such as wanting to balance when she steps in to help/protect [x] or allows him space and opportunity to problem-solve on his own. she said she is also learning how to play games with him, commenting she believes she will find this easier as he grows older and can engage in sporting activities together. [ms slade] conveyed she is a dedicated, conscientious parent who has high self-expectations in her parenting of [x]. she said she is pleased with his progress, commenting that he is happy, smart and playful, can think for himself and is appropriately cautious.[80]
