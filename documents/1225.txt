in strahan & strahan (interim property orders) [2011] famcafc 126, (2011) flc 93-466 (“strahan”), the full court (boland, thackray and o’ryan jj) undertook a comprehensive review of the authorities and identified relevant principles and guidelines to be followed in respect of interim property orders pursuant to ss 79 and 80(1)(h) of the act. it follows from the joint judgment of boland and o’ryan jj in strahan that there are two stages to the hearing of such an application and that the first question on an application for such an order is whether the court should exercise its discretion to entertain the application. whilst it is not necessary for an applicant to establish compelling circumstances for that question to receive an affirmative answer, it is necessary to establish that it would be appropriate for the court to exercise the power and the, “...overarching consideration...” as to appropriateness is the interests of justice. recognising that in the context of s 79 proceedings, the interests of justice will usually be best served by one single and final determination of property orders, it will not be appropriate to exercise the power merely because, on such a final determination, the applicant would receive the interim property sought or in excess of that sought. we think it is important to highlight that whilst the discussion of the first question in the joint judgment in strahan includes examples, including by reference to other cases, where the appropriateness criteria would be met, there was no attempt to define or exhaustively identify those circumstances or categories of cases meeting that criteria. that is understandable, given the discretionary nature of the adjudication involved and the wide range and variety of circumstances presented from case to case, so that any such attempt would likely prove to be futile. nevertheless, the joint judgment in strahan emphasised both the importance of the interests of justice normally being served by a single and final determination of s 79 orders and that establishing only that the applicant’s ultimate entitlement would cover or exceed the interim claim was not sufficient, on its own, to establish that the application ought be entertained. it also follows from strahan that if the first question is answered affirmatively, and the second or substantive stage is reached, because the jurisdiction under s 79 of the act is being exercised, the provisions of that section must be considered and applied, but with limitations given that it is not the final hearing ([135]). as their honours boland and o’ryan jj noted at [136], because the discretion conferred by the power in s 79 is to make such order as the court considers appropriate, provided it is just and equitable to make the order in circumstances where the power will not be exhausted by the interim order, the interim order must be capable of variation or reversal without resort to s 79a of the act or appeal, and must be capable of alteration at any time prior to, or as part of, a final exercise of the s 79 power. however, if it is established that it is likely that the applicant would only be receiving what he or she was entitled to receive when the power was exhausted, that would be sufficient to enable the order sought to be made ([137]).
