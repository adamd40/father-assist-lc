reports of ms h
... proposals of the parties the father is seeking that orders be made for him to spend quality, meaningful time with [x]. he acknowledged that his initial application for orders (made while [x] was residing in the [city j]) are no longer workable. his initial application was for equal shared parental responsibility and for [x] to spend time with him from wednesday to friday in week one and friday to monday in week two, with additional phone calls and school holiday time. the mother is seeking that orders be made for sole parental responsibility and for [x] to have “identity only” contact by way of phone/video call once per fortnight. the mother’s initial proposal was for sole parental responsibility with “recognition contact” on the child’s birthday, the father’s birthday, father’s day and christmas day, with this recognition contact to permanently cease if the father was ever incarcerated again. ... the mother alleges there was an incident of physical violence towards her in 2015, in front of [x], where the father dragged her down a hallway by her hair and hit her head into the fridge and held her face down over a sink while screaming at her. she reported that during this incident she was begging for him to stop and thought that he may kill her. the father conceded that an incident occurred. he reported that he had been angry with the mother and dragged her by the arm into the kitchen so he could argue with her away from [x]. he conceded that the mother would have been fearful during this one incident. ... the mother described being concerned that the father has a propensity for violence and she is concerned that this combined with any drug use may expose [x] to impulsive and unpredictable violent behaviour if in his care. ... child safety and wellbeing the issue of whether the father’s behaviour poses an ongoing risk to [x] is disputed. the father was incarcerated in 2012/2013 [...] for a conviction [...]. as such, he missed [x]’s birth and was released when she was [...] old. the father reported that he had not done this for [himself], however agreed to help a friend [...]. the father reported that he regrets this and should have stayed out of it. the father was then charged and convicted of three counts of [an offence] in 2018. he was sentenced to an intensive correction order. the mother alleges that at the time of this conviction the father had charges for offences and believes that he was not convicted for all of them due to his co-operation with police. she also believes that the father was [conducting illegal activity] in his home due to information from a third party. she also reported that police had found [illegal substances] in [x]’s room in his home. this does not appear consistent with the afp information contained in the 2017 proceedings case file. the mother alleges that the father took [x] with him while he was [conducting illegal activity] and there are photographs from afp surveillance of the father which confirms this[...]. the father has denied this in his filed material and in the previous proceedings. it appears that the father was not convicted of an offence on the dates that the afp observed him with [x], however there appear to be other charges the father was not convicted of and it is unclear whether these dates are related. the father reported that his [...] charges were a result of wanting to help a friend [...]. he alleges that the friend had asked him to [assist] and he agreed, without receiving any benefit to himself. the father reported that he also regrets this choice due to the significant consequences this has had on his relationship with [x]. ... the mother reports that the impact of the father’s criminal behaviour in this matter has had a significant effect on [x]’s wellbeing. she reported that she became aware of the charges after [x] had been told by other children at her school that the father had been arrested. she reported this was embarrassing and difficult for [x]. she further reported that [x] was being told by other children at school that the father is bad person [...]. she said [x] has had difficulty processing this. she reported that she has told [x] that the father “did a bad thing, his punishment was jail and now he has served his punishment”. the father has other criminal history [...]. he has a conviction [...] when he was around 24/25 years of age where he was working [in hospitality] at a licensed venue, the police records appear to show that, after having an issue with patrons, the father pursued them and become involved in a fight. the father reported that this incident was not as it had been represented and that he had been attacked by 4-5 people and had injured them while fighting them off. the father also has another police record [...] where it was alleged that he [committed a criminal offence]. the father did not concede nor deny this [...], and instead provided the context of the situation. he reported that these charges were thrown out of court, however one of the parties civilly sued him and he had to pay a [...] settlement in relation in relation to the harm sustained by that person. ... the mother also alleges that the father has had previous [...] charges [interstate]. she alleges that she found paperwork in the father’s home relating to the court case that occurred in relation to the allegations, and she believes that the father was convicted. she alleges that the information referred to the father [committing serious offences]. the father denies these allegations. however, this writer later found in the child dispute conference dated 2017 (from the previous proceedings) that the family consultant had recorded:
“24. [ms starr] reported that she had been told when [mr starr] was [an adolescent] he had [been charged with sexual offences]. 25. [mr starr] stated regarding the allegations [...], “it’s very personal, i’m not denying it, i don’t want to discuss it”. there was also an allegation that the father sexually assaulted [a relative] when he was 25 years old. the father reported that the allegations were made maliciously, in a circumstance where the paternal grandmother had coerced [a family member] to make the allegations so that the paternal grandmother’s partner could extort [money] from him. he reported that the police and the teacher, to whom the allegations were reported, did not believe the claims and the claims were eventually withdrawn. the mother alleges that, previously when the father was spending time with [x] supervised by [ms e], the father threw a toy of [x]’s in anger. the father conceded that this incident occurred, describing that [x] had poked him in the eye with it so he threw it out of reach. he denied reacting angrily and stated that later that day, the dog had chewed it so he replaced it with a new one. [x] described the incident in her interview (without being prompted) and reported that she could remember the father throwing the toy so hard that it made a hole in the wall.
... the father alleges that [x] told him that on one occasion, [mr m] had gotten into the bath with [x] and he had been naked except for a rubber duck which he allegedly had on the end of his penis. the father alleges that he has a video recording of [x] disclosing this. the father reported that [mr m] asked [x] to touch the rubber duck. ... the father also alleges that [x] had been disciplined with a wooden spoon causing bruises on her legs. he reported that he had video footage of [x] telling him about this. the mother denies all allegations of any abuse to [x] in her household. the father reported that he did not do anything about these allegations as he was unsure about how true they were and [x] had said she touched the duck, not his penis. he also said he “didn’t want to rock the boat” as he had been having 2 weeknights and an alternate weekend with [x] and he didn’t want to risk the mother restricting his time. the mother alleges that there are risks to the child due to the father’s [criminal] affiliations. she alleges that the father was assaulted and threatened with a firearm at a venue that he often took [x] to. the father denies this allegation and says that he had only been physically assaulted and only told the mother so that [x] would not be confronted by his injuries when he picked her up. drugs and alcohol it is common ground that the father has a history of [illicit drug] use. the father reported that he has not used drugs since the criminal proceedings in 2018 and that prior to this his use had been social, however he reported that through intervention while he was in jail he considered that his drug use may have been a problem. as previously stated, the mother has raised concerns about the father’s behaviour and mental state when he has been using [illicit drugs]. ... the father reported that all except one of his frequent drug testing through his ico were clean. he conceded that he had used [illicit drugs] on one occasion and this showed up in his test, however he tried to conceal it at the time and told an alternate story where he had been around someone who used it. he reported on one other occasion that he attended for the test, but was unable to provide a sample. the father reported that there were no concerns about his compliance with drug abstinence during the period of the ico and this appears consistent with [...] corrective services records (subpoena 3). the mother alleges that when the father was having unsupervised time with [x] he has turned up to pick her up and the staff at the childcare centre were so concerned about his presentation, appearing as though he was under the influence of a substance, they reported their concerns to the [...] child protection authority. it was recorded [in] 2017 in the [...] cyps material “2 fridays ago, he turned up to pick the child up from daycare, he looked highly agitated, eyes were red, couldn’t make eye contact, shifty, fidgety. he was not slurring his words, but his language was a bit slower. no smell of any substances. reporter has seen the father several times, his demeanour is quite colourful/varied. he has never been threatening/angry however....however concerns that he is driving under the influence and caring for her for the 2 hours. on wednesday just passed, he was completely normal, not under the influence.” the father alleges the mother has also used [illicit drugs] socially. he alleges this was when they were together and that he had been told by a third party that she had used [illicit drugs] as recently as during these proceedings. he reported that he feels that the mother should also have to undergo drug screening if he is being scrutinised for the same issue. mental health the father reported that he has been experiencing depression and anxiety. the mother denied any formal mental health diagnosis. both parties describe their mental wellbeing being significantly impacted by the circumstances associated with these proceedings. ... the report prepared by [dr o], dated 06/01/2020 at the request of the father’s legal representative prior to his sentencing was reviewed for this assessment. it states:
“based on the information provided to me and the results of psychometric testing, [mr starr] is currently suffering from symptoms consistent with dsm-5 diagnostic criteria for major depressive disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. he identified the onset of his major depressive disorder in 2019 following the offence, and the onset of his post traumatic stress disorder in his late adolescence...” his symptoms of major depressive disorder were described by [dr o] as “persistently depressed mood, loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities, and excessive feelings of guilt, worthlessness and hopelessness. [mr starr] also reports recurrent thoughts of self-harm and suicide, increasing his risk of harm to self”. she further reported “at the time of the offences, [mr starr]’s post traumatic stress disorder was characterised by re-experiencing and avoidance symptoms, along with negative emotional states and cognitions. he also reported symptoms including self-blame, a sense of disconnection from others, hypervigilance, sleep disturbance and risk taking behaviours”. the letter prepared by [mr p] (clinical psychologist), dated 31/03/2020 was also reviewed. it appears that the father was seeing [mr p] on an ongoing basis for psychotherapy and had had 6 sessions prior to [mr p] writing the letter. [mr p] stated: “in my opinion, [mr starr] reports current symptoms of adjustment disorder with mixed anxiety and depression on a background of ptsd with traits of [a mental condition].”
... the mother reported that the ongoing litigation has had a profound impact on her wellbeing, stating “it is draining in so many ways”. she described feeling as though she cannot be as present a parent as she wishes to and that impacts flow through to family members who provide support but also are worried by the proceedings. ... it is of concern that the mother had not previously reported to police, child protection authorities, or sought medical assistance, regarding her allegations about the father physically assaulting [x]. if these allegations are accurate, a failure to act in a timely manner, or with a response consistent with the allegations of harm, queries the mother’s ability to protect her at that time. it is also of concern that the mother is now raising the issue of the father’s alleged sexual assaults on child family members, however had previously allowed [x] unsupervised time with him, when she said she knew about the allegation from when they lived together. similarly, if the father was concerned that [mr m] had sexually assaulted or groomed [x], and he did not voice his concerns due to fear it would affect his time with her, he was placing his own needs above her safety. other than the family violence allegations and sexual assault allegations, the father is conceding a significant portion of the alleged behaviours that could potentially have caused harm to [x]. it is clear that he understands the impact that his criminal behaviour has had on his ability to maintain a relationship with her. while the father concedes these behaviours and expresses shame and remorse about his behaviour, it appears there has been a pattern of the father providing ‘alternate truths’ or misleading professionals undertaking assessments. with the variation in information that has been provided in this court and from other sources, it is difficult to assess the father’s capacity for insight into the actual harm or potential for harm that his behaviour has caused to [x]. ... it is also possible that the father has not been able to clearly express his understanding due to his propensity to self-blame and feel excessive guilt as identified in his psychological assessments. he referred on numerous occasions throughout his interview that he understood that the court would have concerns about his behaviour and he understands why he has to demonstrate that he no longer poses a risk to [x]. he presented genuinely emotional while presenting this information. the father reported that since his criminal proceedings, he has made significant changes in his lifestyle and maintained them, which demonstrates that he is “worthy” of reconnecting with [x]. he specifically reported that he finished his intensive corrections order, has provided 2 clean hair follicle tests, has regularly been attending sessions with 2 psychologists (one for his mental health and the other for support around engaging x), has maintained a good job and has progressed his career in the same company, has had no further police involvement, and has maintained a long term his relationship with his partner. ... the father described [x] needing have a meaningful relationship with him. he stated “i don’t want her to lose the parts of me that are in her” and went on to describe his understanding that children are made up of a little bit of everyone around them and that he wants her to have that opportunity with him. he believes that [x] needs to spend time with him to experience how much he loves her and to share experiences with him. the father believes that his proposal is in the best interests of [x] because he believes that the relationship is not progressing due to the limitations of telephone only contact, particularly the nature of the contact and concerns that [x] is not able to properly engage with him due to being in an environment where the mother is present. he also acknowledged that he is open to guidance about shaping his proposal to meet [x]’s needs and he accepts that he will need to progress at [x]’s pace. if the father’s proposal was successful then the impact on his household may be significant, especially given the geographical distance between [x] and him. he would likely need to travel and source accommodation to lessen the burden of travel on [x], and also, at least initially, engage a professional supervision service. [x] may require additional psychological and emotional support and this would need to be provided by both parents and a professional support such as a psychologist (noting that she is already engaged with a psychologist). the capacity and / or willingness of the adults to work cooperatively in matters related to the child and to facilitate the relationship of the child’s relationship with the other party is currently very poor. this is evidenced in how they have been unable to communicate and how they have engaged in problem solving in relation to the child. although this is disputed over time, and at times it appears that both have made a significant effort to facilitate a relationship between the father and the child, this has diminished since the father’s criminal charges in 2018. ... the mother reported that the relationship has always been strained. she provided examples such as the father refusing to take [x] to her scheduled activities during his time with her and refusing to contribute financially. she also reported that the father has made things difficult for her, such as refusing to allow [x] to travel to [interstate] for her wedding to [mr m] and only consenting after the mother had spent significant funds and experienced significant stress through the court process. the mother believes that the father’s continuation of court proceedings is the father’s further perpetration of control over her. the child and her relationships [x], aged 9 years [x] described close relationships with her mother, [mr m] and her siblings. she described her mum as “perfecto mum”. she described enjoying spending time with her siblings, however sometimes feeling annoyed by them. when talking about her siblings she said fondly “i’m not alone anymore”. she described [mr m] as being a “really good dad” and said that he gets her to focus on her smile when she is feeling upset. [x] refers to [mr m] as “dad”. when asked about the father, [x] was resistant and only answered “meh”. she stated that he calls every thursday to talk with her, however she finds the phone calls boring and repetitive. she stated that the father talks the whole time and asks the same questions. she reported that on occasions, the father has passed the phone to other people that she doesn’t know and referred to them as “uncle”. (the father denied this). [x] reported that a significant issue for her is that the father refers to [mr m] as [...] rather than ‘daddy’. she said that this made her sad, angry and confused and that she had cried and yelled at him to stop. she described the father raising this issue on every phone call. all of the parties described this issue. the mother alleges that the father firstly told [x] that he is her father, not [mr m], then due to [x]’s distress, he started telling her that they were both her dads. then due to [x] still be distressed about this issue, and it appearing to consume a significant part of their communication, he progressed to saying that she could refer to [mr m] as ‘dad’, however he couldn’t also refer to him as ‘dad’ because [mr m] is not his dad. the father said that he has always maintained that it was just him that could not refer to [mr m] as ‘dad’. [x] reported that she was recently told by the father that he was getting her room ready for her to come to their house to visit. she reported that she was confused, “freaked out” and was yelling at the mother because she thought that the mother hadn’t told her that she was going to visit him. she reported that [ms e] is sometimes in the background of phone calls, and that she had also said that they would like her to come and stay. [x] reported that sometimes after her phone calls with the father she feels “shaky”. she said that it’s because “he’s really scary”. when asked why, she answered “mum has told me before that dad’s been to prison”. she also said that a boy at school had told her about this prior to them knowing that he had been incarcerated. she said she had felt confused, told the mother, and they had looked it up on the news together. she said that the mother told her “dad was [committing a crime] and abandoned me”. she also said that she had been told that the father had been to jail a couple of times but she didn’t know what for. [x] then went on to offer other concerns or annoyances that she had with the father. these included that the father had sold her dog without her permission, that when she was a little girl she could remember the father not getting out of bed and she had to make her own breakfast, and that the mother had told her that the father had taken her uncles’ dog hunting and the dog had been killed. she also said that once she had looked under the bed when the father was staying in a hotel in [city d] and saw “a big tub of white dust”. she said she had told the mother about this, however she might not remember. [x] reported that the father had told her on the phone that he was going to marry [ms e]. she said that she felt like he was betraying the mother, however when asked about the mother marrying [mr m], she stated “i’ve got a really good dad now”, referring to [mr m]. when asked about phone calls and the supervised time she had with the father, she reported that the mother had told her that she “just has to do this stuff”. when asked about how she thinks the father feels about her, she would only answer “meh”. [x] made some concerning comments about experiencing fear and a sense of responsibility to protect herself and her family. she described activities that she is engaging in so that she will be ready for “whatever comes”. she listed [sports and exercises] to keep as strong as she can, keeping [weapons] close (implying that she would use them as a weapon), sneaking around the house when everyone is asleep to make sure they are alright and that the doors are locked, and having considered that if she was attacked she should lock herself in the kitchen as “it has the most weapons”. she said that she has not talked to the mother or [ms q] ([x]’s psychologist) about her thoughts around this and has sought to deceive the mother by telling her she is “just playing” when she is practicing her exercises. when asked about where her concerns came from, she stated that the mother had told her that when she was a baby the father had hit her a lot and hit the mother. she also said that there had recently been a number of break-ins in her local area, and that [decorations] which had been out the front of their house had been smashed on the road. she also said that someone had broken into their car and stolen their keys, and that the mother and [mr m] had gotten their locks replaced, installed security cameras on their home, and that a loud ding would go off on [mr m]’s phone and he would watch the camera. she reported feeling worried if windows were left open or she could see [mr m] monitoring the cameras. [x] then went on to describe frightening dreams that she had been having. she reported that “most of my dreams are about [mr starr] (the father) cutting something off my dad ([mr m]), like body parts, or of him hurting mum”. she said that she had had a dream where she had trusted the father when he told her that [mr m] was a “bad guy” and “we let him murder dad ([mr m])”. she also described a dream where the father stabbed and killed every member of her family while she watched and he then stabbed and killed her. she reported that sometimes she cannot wake up from her dreams and that she thinks she shakes and twitches in her sleep. she reported that sometimes she shakes when she is awake because she is so worried. she reported that she has told the mother and [ms q] about some of her dreams but not all of them, including the one where the father had killed her family. during [x]’s interview she made some additional concerning comments about her mental wellbeing. she stated “most of the time i look like i’m happy, but i’m not on the inside. i act happy but most of my life i’ve been sad. it’s like there are no lights on and everything is dark and grey. sometimes i just pretend i’m happy”. she reported that she has not spoken to anyone about these feelings. she said “i don’t want my family to worry at all. i don’t tell them things because i don’t want them to worry about my worrying”. she reported that the only time that she feels happy is when she is [doing her hobbies]. it appears that [x]’s perception of the alleged family violence, abuse and other misdemeanours of the father (whether accurate or not) have been formed through information that she has either been told or otherwise absorbed from exposure in the mother’s home. the extent of [x]’s reported fear is highly concerning. it does also appear though, that the mother has not always held such strong views about the value of the father’s relationship with [x]. when she was speaking with child protection services in october 2017, they recorded “child has not disclosed anything of concern about her time with her father. mother is aware of the good relationship between the child and her father and does not want to stop contact, but wants father to be clean or supervised so she is safe”. [x] wanted the judge/court to know that she does not want to have a relationship with the father. she reported that there was nothing that the father could do differently that would make her change her view on this. [x] reported that she has “already told so many people” her views about what she wants and that “no one listens”. she stated that if orders were made contrary to her wishes she would “be really angry” and “go mental” if the judge doesn’t listen. she said that she would be “out of control, yell and use my fists which i’ve never done before”. given [x]’s perception of lack of safety and previous harm that the father has allegedly caused her, her views are appropriate. it does however appear that [x]’s views have been influenced by views of the father that have been imparted to her both intentionally, and also possibly unintentionally, by the mother. the experience of worries, including nightmares and feeling that she needs to be prepared to defend herself and her family from potential serious assaults and harm are highly concerning, unusual, and not developmentally appropriate for a child of her age. combined with her description of her poor mental wellbeing, it appears that [x]’s mental wellbeing is severely compromised. while it is pleasing to know that [x] is connected to and regularly sees [ms q], who appears from the subpoenaed material to be addressing the issues around [x]’s anxieties and mental health presentation, it is also concerning that [x] reported that she has not discussed all of the aforementioned experiences and concerns with her. according to the mother, it appears that [x] has had more sessions with [ms q] than what is recorded in the subpoenaed material and further issues may have been raised and addressed than what is contained in the subpoenaed material. if they haven’t however, and [x] has raised these experiences and concerns during this interview with a stranger (rather that a counsellor that she has built a rapport with), consideration should be given to her motivation in sharing these concerns. it is noteworthy that some of the things she had expressed were in conflict with what both parents reported (for example the broken toy incident). observations of interactions formal interactions were not conducted for this assessment due to the significant period since the father has spent time with the child and the availability of the supervised contact records from the father’s four sessions of supervised time in 2022. at the first scheduled visit in april 2022, [x] did not agree to see the father and so the supervised visit did not proceed. the [r centre] records stated that [x] was “adamant” that she didn’t want to see the father and that she was “scared”, however could not tell the supervisor why this was. it was reported that she questioned the supervisor about why she was being “forced” and why no one was listening to her. at the second visit in june, [x] also reported to the supervision staff that she felt forced to be there and she didn’t want to engage with the father and would become angry at any suggestion. it appears that after some time they persuaded her to agree to allow him to come over to her and spent some time doing quiet activities. the supervisor recorded that they appeared to “talk comfortably” with each other. they recorded that [x] was “actively engaged, smiling and leaning closer to [mr starr]”. [x] ended the visit by telling the staff she was ready to leave. the supervisor recorded “while walking out to meet [ms starr], [x] was talkative with the supervisors and smiling. [ms starr] arrived and approaching [x] her first comment was “oh you look happy”, sounding surprised and in an accusatory manner. [x]’s disposition immediately changed to withdrawn/unhappy.” the other information recorded about this visit described the father as being attuned to, and respectful of, [x]’s needs and providing her with control over the interaction. at the next visit in august 2022, it appears that [x] took some time to warm up, being described as “very abrupt and short in all responses”. the father had brought some [...] presents for [x] which appears to help their engagement. the supervisor then recorded that “about an hour into the session...she appeared to be enjoying herself with laughter, initiating games and conversation”. again it was recorded that the father was attentive to and led by [x]’s cues. the mother raised with the supervisor at this session, and in her interview for this assessment, that [x] had felt forced to hug the father at the last visit and had been put out about receiving gifts, not being sure if she was allowed to accept them. at the conclusion of this session the supervisor recorded “[x] agreed to a hug when asked and initiated this with [mr starr]. she was relaxed and appeared to be having fun with laughter, and conversation. when back with her mother, her tone returned to be more subdued and as if she had not had a fun time.” at the final supervised visit in september 2022, the visit was after [x] had been upset and angry about the conversation that she had with the father about calling [mr m] “dad”. it was recorded that [x] did not want the visit and felt deceived by being previously told that if she didn’t want the visit she could go home. it was recorded that the “[x] was being unresponsive and not allowing [mr starr] to interact with her at all, [mr starr] remained respectful of this and appeared to genuinely want to understand her reasons for anger towards him”. when asked about her supervised visits with the father, [x] said they were annoying and that she had only enjoyed playing with [ms s] (the supervisor). she said that she pretended she was having fun with the father, however she was actually scared that he would hit her or yell at her. evaluation the limitations identified to this report are the lack of information from the police, and court records and counselling records pertaining to the father. [x]’s expressed views are that she does not wish to have a relationship of form with the father. these views should be given some weight due to the disruptions that have occurred in the relationship between [x] and the father due to his criminal behaviour. however, they should also be given weight cautiously in consideration of it appearing that [x] is being influenced with the views she has formed of the father. this report has identified that there are potential risks for [x] with the father in relation to alleged family violence and abuse, drug abuse and criminal behaviour. there have certainly been past risks to [x] pertaining to the father’s criminal behaviour and this has in turn severely impacted the relationship between the father and the child. the father has reported a number of positive changes that he has sustained to demonstrate that he has addressed the issues of risk to [x]. if the court can verify that these actions have been taken as the father reports, the risk of future potential harm is minimised. it is however of significant concern that there are outstanding allegations of the father sexually assaulting family members that have not been acknowledged by the father, or adequately assessed in this report due to lack of relevant collateral information. if it is found that these allegations are true, and the father is not able to acknowledge or demonstrate insight and successful engagement with intervention to address these issues, the risks related to this issue should be considered as significant. this report has also identified that there are significant mental health risks to [x] in relation to the effect the dispute is having on her. due to [x]’s limited communication with the father and from [x]’s own disclosures, it appears that much of the basis for [x]’s fears which impact her mental health are coming from discussions with or exposure to adult information from the mother. given the mother had also not acknowledged this during the assessment, this remains an ongoing issue of concern. there is no independent material available relating to family violence between the parents. however it is common ground that there has been a previous avo protecting the mother from the father, although associated charges are disputed. the father does however, have a criminal record in relation to assaults (although not on an intimate partner) where the other parties have sustained significant injuries as a result of the force used by the father. it is of concern that the father appeared to justify the behaviour and minimise his responsibility for the assaults. while there are serious allegations about the father’s assaults on both the mother and [x], these allegations are disputed. with the lack of collateral information and the historical nature of the allegations, it is difficult to ascertain whether the mother’s allegations are correct. if it was found that the mother’s version of events are accurate, it would indicate potential serious risk to [x] in the father’s care. if the father’s version of events are correct, the risk of harm to [x]’s emotional wellbeing in the context of the mother’s allegations and messaging to [x] are significant and should be considered. this issue will be discussed further below. the mother’s allegations that the father’s aggressive and/or violent behaviour is exacerbated by intoxicating substances combined with the impairment of judgement experienced by anyone while under the influence of such substances, poses significant additional risk to the child if the father was to relapse into drug use. further, children in the care of drug affected parents are at risk of a range of harmful parenting behaviours. for example, poor family functioning, inconsistent parenting (including an inability for a parent to be emotionally attuned to a child) and inadequate supervision. in this case, there appears to have been further risks associated with the child travelling in a car with an intoxicated driver, exposure to drug and gang affiliated criminals and direct exposure to significant quantities of drugs located in the father’s home. the mother is clearly concerned about the risks to [x] due to the father’s criminal involvement, drug use and the other issues of concern that she has alleged around violence and abuse. during the mother’s interview she described these concerns, however also appeared to exaggerate some of her claims (for example that drugs were found in [x]’s bedroom by the afp) which makes it difficult to assess the risks. the mother may feel that she needs to provide the ‘worst case’ for the father’s behaviour, or it is also possible that over the extensive length of this dispute, the mother has become confused about some of the details. the issue of [x]’s mental wellbeing is of high concern in this matter. [x] is clearly finding it difficult to mentally and emotionally navigate what has been an extensive and long term dispute about her parenting arrangements. the mother’s ability to understand and effectively meet the needs of [x] appears to be varied. while she provides for [x]’s practical day to day needs to a very high level, it appears from [x]’s presentation and reports that she has had difficulties separating the adult issues and her own concerns about the father from [x]. it could be seen that the mother has attempted to influence [x] in relation to her views and feelings about her relationship with the father. as previously indicated, [x]’s interview showed clear indications of this and it appears to have had a profound impact on [x]’s emotional wellbeing. the father’s ability to understand and effectively meet the needs of [x] has also been varied. the father has been able to demonstrate recently in the supervised contact sessions that he can be attuned to and effectively respond to [x]’s needs. it appears that the two separate supervision staff believed that the father had the ability to read and respond appropriately to [x]’s cues in an appropriate way to rebuild the relationship. during this assessment, the father also was able to articulate sound strategies for engaging with her, demonstrate capacity for empathy, and take responsibility for the situation that [x] is in. however, there have also been periods when the father has not considered the impact of his behaviour on [x] which is evidenced in his criminal behaviours. it is common ground that the father has also had difficulties engaging with [x] over the phone. this could be a reflection of him struggling to consistently attune to her, however could also be considered reasonable due to the limitations of the medium, which is the only way he has been able to engage with her. children of [x]’s age require a safe and secure home environment where their emotional and psychological needs are nurtured. [x] is starting to formulate a more complex sense of self and she is becoming more aware of the complexity of emotions and will be having increased awareness of the emotions of others. in high conflict matters, children in this age group struggle with issues around parental loyalty and may be found to side with one parent as a means of escaping the conflict. in addition to the information that [x] provided about the father previously harming both her and the mother, [x] also provided some additional information that does not appear to be accurate, such as seeing a tub of white powder under a hotel bed and the father breaking a wall by throwing her toy. it is possible that [x] is inventing scary details about things that she is worried or anxious about and these details could seem very real to her. it is also possible that [x] is presenting these incidents as a way for her to support the mother’s case, believing that this may elicit a sense of relief from the conflict for her. as already stated, [x] has been involved in conflict regarding her parenting arrangement for half of her life. common developmental consequences seen in children living in high conflict situations can include: manifestation of significant mental health difficulties including anxiety and depression. developmental milestones not being achieved as a result of the lack of stability in the familial environment and interjecting conflict. being forced to choose one parent over the other as a means of escaping the ongoing conflict, or alternatively premature removal from both households and living with friends. poor self-esteem as a result of trying to resolve feelings of guilt and disloyalty. if it is the case that the mother has acted in an aligning manner with [x], then the effect of ‘choosing a side’ will have been a protective one for her as it will have provided her with some respite from emotional pressure she may have experienced in the mother’s household if she did attempt to have a positive relationship with the father. while such an approach can provide a temporary relief for a child, if issues of alignment are not addressed then there will be ongoing and lasting consequences for the future social, emotional and psychological development of [x]. for example, if this is the case, she may experience feelings of self-blame, guilt, anxiety and probably remorse for how her actions have impacted on the father and her relationship with the father. if the court were to find that the father does not pose a current risk to [x] and is unlikely to pose a future risk to [x], it appears to be in [x]’s best interests to have the opportunity to meaningfully reconnect with the father in an environment where she can independently form her own views of him. given [x]’s experiences of anxiety and fear around spending time with the father, this would need to be enacted in a sensitive way, at [x]’s pace, and with the specialised support of a service such as the [t program] in conjunction with [x]’s psychologist and a supervised contact service. the court may wish to consider whether the father’s partner would be an appropriate alternative option for supervision of ongoing time with the father. for this option to effectively mitigate the risks, the court would need to feel assured that she was able to identify and act appropriately should the father’s behaviour resemble any of the aforementioned concerns. if the father were to commence time with [x] and [x] was exposed to future harm in his care, the impact on [x]’s emotional and psychological wellbeing would be significant. [x] would be likely to feel that warranted in her fears and the experience would destabilise [x]’s trust in adults. she would likely experience a trauma response that she is particularly vulnerable to, given her current fears and anxiety. should the court consider the father continuing with the telephone calls on a fortnightly basis as per the mother’s proposal, this would mitigate the risks of physical harm to [x] and provide her with the opportunity to connect with the father for identity purposes. the challenge with this however, is that the communication does not appear to meaningful, [x] finds the communication mundane and burdensome and there is the risk that she will disengage or alternatively wish to re-engage without an emotional safety framework established for her. the court may wish to consider whether the father’s partner would be an appropriate option for supervision of ongoing time with the father. for this option to effectively mitigate the risks, the court would need to feel assured that she was able to identify and act appropriately should the father’s behaviour resemble any of the aforementioned concerns. this writer views the capacity of the parties to have shared parental responsibility as limited. this is due to the concerns raised about the power dynamics in the parents’ relationship, the limits to the engagement of the father in the child’s day to day life and the ongoing impact of the long term litigation on their ability to communicate and negotiate. recommendations based on the information gathered in this assessment, the following is recommended: it is recommended that the mother have sole parental responsibility for the child, with the view to seek the father’s views on major decisions for her. it is recommended that [x] live with the mother. further investigation of the issues of the allegations of sexual assault, family violence and confirmation of the father’s capacity to have sustained the changes he alleges to have made should be undertaken to ascertain the current and future risk to [x]. additional information which would be of assistance, includes [interstate] police and court records, the father’s counselling records and a further hair strand drug test. if the court finds that the father does not pose a current or future risk to [x], it is recommended that an order is made to provide for support for the father and [x] to recommence spending time together, with the aforementioned supports of the [t program], [x]’s psychologist and a supervised contact service, with the view to spend time arrangements for one weekend per month initially supervised under the management of the [t program] and then progressing to unsupervised when [x] is ready. following this, additional time should be considered for holiday time and special occasions or if the geographical distance reduces. if the court finds that the father does pose a current or future risk to [x], it is recommended that [x] spends no time and has no communication with the father.
context of the child and family the purpose of this report is to assist the court in determining the parenting arrangements for [x] (born 2013, now aged 10 years). this addendum family report was ordered by his honour judge neville on the 07/07/2023 to review additional subpoenaed materials from the australian federal police, [state] police, the department of education, children and young people and [u psychology] and consider the joint letter of instruction provided by the independent children’s lawyer on behalf of the applicant father, respondent mother and the independent children’s lawyer. as per the letter of instruction, this addendum family report will address three key areas. do your recommendations in relation to what, if any, time [x] should spend with the father change. if so, how and why, and if not, why? no further information provided by the subpoenaed material provides definitive information regarding the risks raised in relation to the allegations of sexual assault or family violence. the recommendations remain the same, in that ultimately a determination of the court in relation to the risks is required. however, if the court finds that the father poses an unacceptable risk to [x], it is recommended that the father spend no time and have no communication with [x]. if the court finds that the father does not pose an unacceptable risk to [x], in addition to [x] and the father commencing in a specialised support services as outlined in the recommendations in the initial family report, it is recommended that the mother engage in therapeutic counselling to assist her in managing her own emotional responses to be able to support [x] to repair the fracture in her relationship with the father. has your assessment of risks that may be posed to [x] in spending time with her father change? if so, how and why, and if not, why? the subpoenaed material provided some minimal information about the allegations of sexual assault by the father on his [relatives]. the first allegation of the mother, as recorded in the initial family report, was that she had seen records pertaining to a court case in relation to the father sexually assaulting [relatives] when he was [an adolescent]. the department for education, children and young people records (subpoena 7) showed that the father had engaged in [sexualised activity] when he was [an adolescent]. the records showed that the victim in the matter “had no concerns regarding her safety and was rather unconcerned about the incident”. however, there is no indication in the report as to the age of the victim, and as a child, she would not have the capacity to protect herself, nor fully understand the dynamic of sexual assault. at the time, the father reported to the investigating child protection officer that both children would “touch each other under the clothing and would touch each other’s private parts”. the father further told them that he “would not force ... to touch his private parts”. he also told them that both children would initiate the contact. there is no information pertaining to the father’s [relative]’s account of the events, nor any reference to reports pertaining to the father’s [other relative], as alleged by the mother. the mother also alleged that the father had sexually assaulted [a relative] when he was 25 years old and she was [underage]. the afp records (subpoena 5) showed that the father’s [relative] had disclosed to a teacher that she had sexual intercourse with the father. the [relative] then withdrew her allegations and denied the initial disclosure. while there were queries noted about the [relative] being known for making false allegations, it is also common for victims of sexual assault to withdraw allegations. the historical nature of the allegations, in addition to the lack of clear information about the investigations further complicates this assessment. it is noteworthy that the father has had no allegations pertaining to sexual offending since the allegation [...], however the father has engaged in a number of other offending behaviours since that time, which have continued up until his incarceration in 2018. it appears from the afp records (subpoena 5) that the father was arrested once in 2021 for breaching his bail curfew conditions. if the court finds that the father does not pose a risk to [x], however the mother believes that the father may pose a risk of sexual, physical or other harm to her, then the most significant risk to x] may be her exposure to this parenting dynamic and the impact on her mental and emotional wellbeing, which was discussed in the previous report. [x] is approaching adolescence. it is worth noting that if [x] is denied the opportunity to have a relationship with the father in the instance that the father does not pose an unacceptable risk to her and he is able to demonstrate that he is able to provide [x] with stability and consistency within in a potential relationship, there may be adverse outcomes for [x] if this relationship is severed. for example, children who have not been able to maintain a relationship with both parents commonly experience issues such as low self-esteem, poor mental health, alcohol or substance abuse issues and problems within their own interpersonal relationships later life. children who have become aligned with one parent following a separation often find the period of adolescence particularly difficult. one of the primary developmental functions of the adolescent phase is to individuate from the family of origin and develop their own values, morals and individual identity. during the process of individuating, adolescents will generally test boundaries, rebut the authority of their parents and challenge the value system of their family unit. in cases where children have become aligned with one parent, they have often lived with an early childhood experience of identifying themself as being “good”, like the “good” parent they have aligned with, and nothing like the “bad” parent who they have removed themself from. during adolescence, children who experience this alignment with one parent may experience an identification struggle and misinterpret their normal developmental function of individuating from the “good” parent as now identifying with the “bad” parent. further, once [x] grows older and can critically examine the information provided to her by the mother and compare it with her lived experience of the father, she may reject the mother’s views and form an alliance with the father. it is for these reasons that during the adolescent phase, that young people can be found changing households and living with a parent whom they have had very little contact with. if it is the case that the father does not pose an unacceptable risk to [x], the mother may be either intentionally or unintentionally aligning [x] with her views as a result of her own anxieties around her own beliefs around the father’s potential for harm. if the court makes a determination as such, it would be of benefit for the mother to engage with psychological support to assist her to address this issue. if the court finds that the father does not pose an unacceptable risk, then it is suggested that [x] be provided with opportunities to both reality test her views of the father and be supported to re-establish a relationship with him in a therapeutic and supportive environment. it would not be supportive of [x]’s overall emotional or psychological wellbeing to support or empower [x] to maintain the view that she is unsafe with or disrespected by the father if this is the case. there would be further psychological and emotional impacts on [x] if the court orders that she is not to spend time or have communication with the father in the case that she is safe with him. these include that [x] may feel as though the father has abandoned her, she may learn that it is better to avoid rather than manage situations of conflict and she may continue to manifest unwarranted anxiety around the father. has your assessment changed in relation to the emotional or psychological impact on [x] changed if she was ordered to spend time with her father? if so, how and why, and if not, why? the court ultimately needs to make a determination about whether there is current and/or likely future risk to [x] pertaining to the father’s criminal history, the allegations of family violence and the allegations around sexual assault. on review of the [u psychology] records (subpoena 8), [x] appears to have maintained the view that the father is “not respecting her” in her sessions with her psychologist (subpoena 8). children of [x]’s age can be quite black and white in their thinking, particularly around moral judgements. when [x] refers to the father “not respecting her” in relation to the issue mentioned in the initial assessment (around the father’s discouragement/resistance of the term “dad” in relation to [mr m]), it may be developmentally appropriate that she is concrete in this thinking and unable to move past this perceived transgression of the father. if the court orders for [x] to continue to have communication and/or time with the father in the case that it is determined that he does not pose a risk to her, [x] is going to find this challenging. she will likely experience an exacerbation of emotional distress and/or anxiety at the beginning of this process, given the inflexibility in her current views and this process would require support through counselling and co-ordination from a specialised support service, such as the [t program] which was recommended in the initial family report. further, if the mother genuinely has concerns and continues to have concerns for [x]’s wellbeing in a situation where the mother is required to facilitate [x]’s spending time with the father, this will have a further effect on [x]’s emotional and psychological wellbeing. the mother has been [x]’s primary and consistent attachment figure throughout her childhood and as such [x] will be attuned to the mother’s emotional wellbeing, particularly her stress response and this will have a flow on effect to [x]. if the court orders for [x] to continue have communication and/or time with [x] in the case that he poses a risk to her and that risk eventuates into harm for her (psychological, emotional and/or physical harm), the impact on [x]’s psychological and emotional wellbeing will be severe. it will reinforce her anxieties that she has expressed and cause distrust for her in the relationships that she has sought safety, for example her relationship with the mother. implications of this could manifest by way of increased poor mental health and other trauma impacts and should therefore be considered with significant weight.
applicant’s written submissions
the rice v asplund principle the law pertaining to the application of the rule in rice v asplund is well settled: "the principles which in my view should apply in such cases are that the court should have regard to any earlier order and to the reasons for and the material on which that order was based. it should not lightly entertain an application to reverse an earlier custody order. to do so would invite endless litigation for change in an ever-present factor in human affairs. therefore, the court would need to be satisfied by the applicant that there was some changed circumstance which would justify such a serious step, some new factor arising, or, at any rate, some new factor which was not disclosed at the previous hearing which would have been material." [emphasis added] material changes in circumstances relied upon by father the father relies, inter alia, on the following material changes in circumstances. mother is no longer residing in [country v] when the matter was last before the court, one of the prominent features of the case was the uncertainty surrounding what would happen after the mother and the child had returned from the posting in [country v], which was intended to be for three years. the enquiry focused on the time and communication between the child and the father which could take place in the short time between when the mother and child left for [country v] and during the time that they were in [country v]. the court was limited by the fact that where the mother and child would be residing after that posting in [country v] had concluded was unknown. this was referred to by his honour at the hearing during which the final orders were pronounced as “one major unknown which no one can know.” as such, the court did not make contact orders between the father and the child after the posting in [country v] had concluded, although contact was ordered prior to departure. the mother and the child have returned from [country v] and are now residing in [city d]. father’s arrangements after his period of incarceration the other major unknown which the court was grappling with when considering whether it could make final orders with respect to time arrangements was the extent of the father’s sentence, including any period of incarceration, as well as where the father would be living after any period of incarceration. as it transpired the father was not incarcerated and did not leave [city j]. he intends to remain in [city j] going forward. it is a material change in circumstance that the two factors which were referred to by his honour as ‘unknowns’ when the matter was last before the court are now known. the other change in circumstance is that the relationship between the father and child which was once strong has deteriorated in the current regime and given the mother’s inappropriate influence on the child’s views of the father. notation c as can be gleaned from the transcript of the hearing on 6 december 2019, the court was grappling with having to finalise the proceedings without a ‘crystal ball’. his honour succinctly summaries the position wherein he finds “so there are two very significant unknowns....when we were last together, it was sort of left on the basis regarding those longer-term issues that when they are clarified one way or the other – and both of them need to be clarified- then the parties should arrange some form of mediation to see if longer-term issues can be resolved. and if those longer-term issues are not able to be resolved, then the parties may come back to court.” that the parties may come back to court was repeated by his honour later in the reasons. it is not suggested that this court is bound by the notation. however, the notation itself supports the submission that the court did at the time, and still should, take the view that significant change of circumstances would arise once the two issues identified in (a) and (b) of notation c were clarified which warrant a revisiting of the final orders. second limb of the test when considering the approach the court should take in considering the rice & asplund principle as a preliminary matter, the full court has found: “the primary judge's task was a two-staged process. first, to make findings of fact as to what changes there had been in circumstances since the making of the 2015 orders and secondly, to assess whether or not the father had established that these changes are sufficient to provoke a new inquiry, or put in another way, whether the father has established a prima facie case of changed circumstances that would justify embarking on a second contested parenting hearing as being in the child's best interests.” [emphasis added] here the circumstances are sufficient to provoke a new inquiry, particularly where the undisputed evidence is that the alternative to a new enquiry is that the child will be denied a meaningful relationship with her biological father. the current video phone time (which is all that the orders permit) is not working. it has not and will not promote a meaningful relationship between the child and the father. this is in circumstances where in the family report and the addendum family report recommend that, provided that the court determines the father does not pose an unacceptable risk, it would be in the best interests of the child to have the opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with the father, and it would be detrimental to her longer term well-being if she were denied this opportunity. a full hearing is required in order to determine the issue of unacceptable risk. the other matter which also requires a full enquiry is the emotional risk the mother poses to the child in attempting to influence the child’s views of the father. there is ample evidence in the family report and the supervision report to suggest that the mother is engaging in such behaviour and, ‘if the father’s versions of events are correct, the risk of harm to [x]’s emotional wellbeing in the context of the mother’s allegations and messaging to [x] are significant and should be considered’. the family report also notes “it appears that much of the basis for [x]’s fears which impact her mental health are coming from discussions with or exposure to adult information from her mother. given the mother had also not acknowledged this during the assessment, this remains on ongoing issue of concern”. when the rule in rice & asplund is considered at a preliminary hearing and if such application to re-open parenting proceedings is resisted (as in this case), then: "...when the threshold question described in rice and asplund is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination “on the merits”. where an application is dismissed at a preliminary stage, it is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of a party to appear or some lack of compliance with form and procedure but rather because, assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an insufficient change of circumstances shown to justify embarking on a hearing. though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child's welfare than to allow the application to continue". it is conceded that one of the factors to weigh up is the undesirability of further litigation. however, in the context where the alternative is a child being denied the opportunity of a meaningful relationship with her biological father, and there being an identified emotional risk in the context of the child being aligned with the mother, the factors weigh in favour of reopening. it is conceded that after a full retesting of the evidence at a final hearing, the court may ultimately find against orders for substantial time. however, the body of evidence in this case supports the court undertaking that enquiry before closing the door on the relationship. although the mother raises a number of allegations against the father which she presumably says support the court not revisiting the final orders, with respect to those matters it is submitted: (a) most of the allegations were raised in the previous proceedings, and despite the allegations, the court made orders for the child to spend time with the father, prior to her leaving for [country v], (b) the matters are in dispute, and at a preliminary enquiry, the court is to take the father’s evidence at its highest.

the relevant law – principals established in the case of rice & asplund the principles or “rule” in the case of rice & asplund [1978] famcafc 128, (1979) 6 famlr 570 was enunciated by evatt cj for the full court as follows:
“the principles, which in my view, should apply to such cases are that the court should have regard to any earlier order and to the reasons for and the material upon which it was based. it should not lightly entertain an application to reverse an earlier custody order. to do so would be to invite endless litigation.”
the court should only hear an application to vary an earlier order if satisfied that there:
“is some changed circumstance which would justify such a serious step, some new matter arising or, at any rate, some factor which was not disclosed at the previous hearing which would have been material...” “it is a question of finding that there are circumstances which require the court to consider afresh how the welfare of the child should be best served" in sps & pls the full court said at paragraph 82 and 83: (v) the application of the rule [in rice & asplund] is closely connected with the nature of and degree of change sought to the earlier order. (83) accordingly, the rule may not impede hearing an application for a small alteration, which may require only a short and narrow enquiry, but may properly prevent a hearing in respect of more far-reaching changes. in the recent decision of trewitt & brock, the appeal division stated at paragraph 29 & 30: the weight of authority and the terms of s 64b of the act itself point to the order dismissing the father’s application made by her honour as not being a parenting order within that section. that being so, the court is not obliged to have regard to the mandatory terms of s 60cc of the act. nonetheless, as the authorities make clear, the determination of whether there should be a reconsideration of existing parenting orders, is one that must be made in the best interests of the child. often that determination will focus on the nature of the change in circumstances, if any, and the detriment to the child of further litigation. considerations raised by s 60cc of the act may also, obviously, be relevant.
application of r&a principles in the present case a final hearing occurred in september 2019. parties were cross-examined and submissions were filed. the final orders made on 6 december 2019. the father filed his initiating application on 12 august 2021 seeking "spend time with" orders together with his supporting affidavit. following release of the family reports the father has filed an amended initiating application. the nature of the amended orders sought for time and parental responsibility remain of similar nature. the father seems to rely on the fact that the child is (a) now living in australia (b) he has received an intensive corrections order (ico) for his criminal matters and (c) he has provided clean urine results, as significant changes in circumstances to vary the current parenting orders. if this is correct, then it is respectfully submitted that grounds (a) and (b) are not significant changes in circumstances and (c) should be treated with caution, for reasons set out at paragraphs 7 and 8 below. when the final orders were made in december 2019, the court was aware that the child had not been living in [city j] for some time and would be living in [country v] for a defined period. the court was also aware that the father had pleaded guilty to his criminal matters and was awaiting sentencing where, importantly, incarceration was a possibility. indeed, order 5 of the final orders foreshadowed "in the event that the applicant father is incarcerated ...". as to the father's negative results for illicit substances during the ico, the father neglected to disclose that he failed to attend drug testing [in early] 2020, and [in early] 2020 tested positive to [illicit drugs] in circumstances where he had charged with [offences]. in the sentencing remarks, [his honour] found the father's explanation that he had been in the presence of others who had been using [illicit drugs] "improbable" because the pathologist advised that the level detected in the father's system was more likely due to the drug being ingested as the confirmatory result was more than twice the level of the cut-off results (page 15, paragraph 19 of annexure “a” in the affidavit filed by the mother on 29 september 2023). additionally, the father does not provide any evidence of what he has done to address his drug issues and, more importantly, what he will do to prevent future relapse in circumstances where the mother alleges that the father has a history of drug abuse. notwithstanding [the judge’s] remarks, the father, concerningly, maintained to the child inclusive conference (cic) reporter that that "he has not used illicit substances for the "past 7-8 years" and that "trace amounts of [illicit drugs] were detected in one sample, but that he believes this occurred when he consumed a friend's drink which was spiked with [illicit drugs]". the father did not appeal the final orders. perhaps the father was relying on notation c to bring the matter before the court for parenting arrangements, but if correct, there are problems with this approach. the first problem is that notation c is not an order. there is no order in the final orders that provides for the father to bring the matter back to the court if mediation was unsuccessful in relation to parenting arrangements. the second problem is that notation c states at the end, " if no agreement is reached the matter may be re-listed". it does not eliminate the necessity to consider the principles in rice & asplund in any relisted application. the court now has the benefit of both the family report and addendum report of [ms h]. notwithstanding the comprehensiveness of the reports, they do not significantly change the situation from that which existed at the conclusion of 2019 final hearing where the court had the benefit not available to the report writer of hearing direct evidence involving significant allegations regarding issues of family violence, drugs and criminal activities of the father and the risk posed to the child as a result of these activities. the recommendations of [ms h] is expressed as dependent on any findings of risk to the child. this remains identical to what was considered and decided at the final hearing. if anything, following isles & nelissen, the predicative nature of assessment of risk based on historical facts would only lead to an enhanced finding of unacceptability of risk. this is particularly the case where it is abundantly apparent from the family reports that the father continues to justify and/or deflect any person responsibility for his historical short comings as was the case during the 2019 hearings. there is no significant change is this regard. even if the court is satisfied that there has been a significant change in circumstances, that is not the end of the matter. the father must also satisfy the court that it is in the best interest of the child to recommence proceedings and engage in the process of another hearing. the child was approximately three years of age when the proceedings first commenced in 2016 for three years. the child is now ten years of age, and the father is seeking to embark upon opening another chapter of court proceedings. as the child is older and has been engaged in the court process through the cic and a new family report for the father's latest application, she is now more aware of the court proceedings, which was not a factor in the previous proceedings. the family report also notes with concern the possible impact of changing the current arrangements on the respondent mother and the child’s relationship with the mother, such that any change in arrangements is not in the best interest of the child. it is submitted that upon consideration of the principles arising from rice and asplund, the court would appropriately find that the father has failed to establish significant changes in circumstances to justify re-hearing of the matter and, therefore, it is not in the child's best interest to re-litigate the matter.

the mother reports that the impact of the father’s criminal behaviour in this matter has had a significant effect on [x]’s wellbeing. she reported that she became aware of the charges – “she” being [x] – after [x] had been told by other children at her school that her father had been arrested. she reported this was embarrassing and difficult for [x]. she further reported that [x] was being told by other children that her father is a bad person who sold poison. she had [x] had had difficulty processing this. she reported that she has told [x] that the father did a bad thing and his punishment was jail, and now he has served his punishment. ... [x] reported that sometimes after her phone calls with the father, she feels shaky. she said that that is because he is really scary. when asked why, she answered, “mum has told me before that dad has been in prison”. she also said that a boy at school had told her about this prior to her knowing that he had been incarcerated. she said she had felt confused, told her mother, and they had looked it up in the news together. she said that her mother had told her, “dad was [committing a crime] and abandoned me”. she also said that she had told her [that] her father had been left in jail a couple of times, but she did not know for what.

“... it should not lightly entertain an application to reverse an earlier custody order. to do so would be to invite endless litigation for change is an ever present factor in human affairs. therefore, the court would need to be satisfied by the applicant that, to quote barber j., there is some changed circumstances which will justify such a serious step, some new factor arising or, at any rate, some factor which was not disclosed at the previous hearing which would have been material.” the mother seeks that the rule in rice & asplund be determined on a preliminary basis. at the time of final orders being made, it was known that the child [x] would be living in [country v] for a period of approximately three years with her mother and step-father, it could not be confirmed where the family would reside after the [country v] posting. at the time of the making of the orders the father was awaiting sentencing in relation to drug-related criminal charges. it is submitted that the orders made on 6 december 2019, contemplated both the situation of the father serving a term of imprisonment or the father serving any time in the community. to the extent the father seeks to rely on notation c to the orders, the independent children’s lawyer submits that all the notation provides for is for the matter to be re-listed which has occurred. it does not and cannot have the power to overcome the rule in rice v asplund. in relation to the rule in rice and asplund, the court must consider the important decision of warrick j in sps & pls [2008] famcafc 16, (2008) flc 93-363 specifically paragraphs 48 and 81. as noted in these paragraphs irrespective of when the rule is applied, it is a manifestation of the best interests principle and when determined on a preliminary basis it is determined on the merits. as the court is aware there are a number of authorities that make clear that when considering the threshold question the court must consider whether a re-opening of the matter would be in the child’s best interests. this involves weighing the nature of any likely change to the orders against the potential detriment to the child of litigation. the father’s amended initiating application seeks final orders that:- the parents have equal shared parental responsibility in relation to the issue of “the geographic region in which [x] lives.” the father seeks spend time with orders that on their face seek that [x] go from spending no time with her father, to overnight time commencing in january 2024 in [city d], and then from february 2024 the overnight time occur in [city j]. the father also seeks from the term 1 school holidays in 2024 half of school holidays. the father’s amended initiating application seeks interim orders that vary vastly to the final orders he seeks. the interim orders sought by the father have overnight time commencing in august 2024. the father’s supporting affidavit provides no evidence that [x]’s psychologist would be prepared to facilitate any meeting between [x] and her father, in fact the evidence would suggest otherwise, or whether [r centre] would be able or willing to facilitate the time proposed by the father. the independent children’s lawyer is conscious that if the father is not successful that it may mean that there is no meaningful relationship between him and [x], at best the relationship may continue to be maintained via phone calls for identity purposes only. the reality of the circumstances in this case is that [x] has always lived with her mother who is her primary carer and [mr m], who for all purposes is [x]’s father figure. the independent children’s lawyer has considered the family report and addendum family report by [ms h]. the independent children’s lawyer has paid particular attention to paragraphs 124 to 134 of the family report dated 20 march 2023 and paragraphs 18 to 22 of the addendum family report dated 22 september 2023 that evaluate the possible risks to [x] in relation to possible outcomes in relation to spend time with orders. in balancing all the above, the independent children’s lawyer submits the father’s application should be dismissed on the basis that it is not in [x]’s best interests for there to be ongoing litigation given: - [x] has been involved in a high conflict parenting dispute most of her life. [x] has now had to participate in family report interviews and meetings with the independent children’s lawyer. [x] displays anxiety and fear around spending time with her father and remains resistant to spending anytime with her father. taking the father’s case at its highest the father is unlikely to succeed in obtaining the final orders sought by him at a final hearing. if the father is successful in overcoming the test in rice & asplund, the independent children’s lawyer submits that the matter should be set down for final hearing and estimates the matter to take 3 days.

she stated that if orders were made contrary to her wishes, she would be really angry and go mental if the judge doesn’t listen. she said she would be out of control, yell and use my fists, which i have never done before.
outline of principle ] in my view, reflection on the rule shows that: (i) what the application of the rule can achieve if dealt with as a preliminary matter is different from what it can achieve if dealt with at the end of a full hearing. (ii) in its original formulation, the rule is directed to application as a preliminary matter. yet, contemporaneously with that formulation the court in rice and asplund determined that the rule could equally be applied at the end of a full custody hearing. the consequences of that determination have received little attention. (iii) at whatever stage of a hearing the rule is applied, its application should remain merely a manifestation of the “best interests principle”. (iv) discussion in terms that the rule may be applied as a “preliminary matter” or the primary application be first heard “on the merits” may be unhelpful, particularly because of the implication that, if the rule is applied as a preliminary matter, the parenting application is not then dealt with “on the merits”. (v) the application of the rule is closely connected with the nature of, and degree of, change sought to the earlier order. (vi) “shorthand” statements of the rule may contribute to its misapplication. (vii) any application of the rule must now measure the evidence against the principles set out in part vii of the act, in particular the objects of the part, the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and the steps required by the act consequent upon an order made or to be made in that regard. [81] ...in my view when the threshold question described in rice and asplund is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination “on the merits”. where an application is dismissed at a preliminary stage, it is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of a party to appear or some lack of compliance with form and procedure but rather because, assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an insufficient change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing. though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child’s welfare than to allow the application to continue.   what the application of the rule can achieve if dealt with as a preliminary matter is different from what it can achieve if dealt with at the end of a full hearing.

it may be, however, that neither the expressions “summary dismissal” or “striking out” is the best term to describe the procedure when, in a parenting case, the rule in rice and asplund is considered at a preliminary stage. this is because, as we seek to emphasise, at whatever stage the rule in rice and asplund is applied, the court is bound to take into account best interests considerations and also because specific requirements, including legislative requirements, apply.  ] in our view, that passage [at [81] in sps & pls] need not be taken as saying that the only way in which the rule in rice and asplund can be applied at a preliminary stage is on the basis that the case of the applicant for parenting orders is taken at its highest. ... [82] ... the qualitative question of whether a change that has occurred is or is not sufficiently significant to justify a full further hearing of a parenting issue may be one much more difficult to answer in a preliminary hearing involving resolution of only some disputed facts. [83] this observation may be behind the approach that either the case of the applicant for parenting orders is, at a preliminary stage, taken at its highest, or the hearing embarked upon is an enquiry into all matters relating to the best interests of the child or children. [84] on the other hand, there is authority to suggest that these are not the only legitimate procedures....
nevertheless, there are significant changes that occur and which do require a court to reconsider decisions previously made. whether in a particular case a court should be willing to embark upon another hearing concerning the child and parent, or whether to do so would itself be demonstrably contrary to the best interests of the child, is a decision to be made in each particular case. how is that decision to be made? the court must look at: the past circumstances, including the reasons for the decision and the evidence upon which it was based. whether there is a likelihood of orders being varied in a significant way, as a result of a new hearing. if there is such a likelihood, the nature of the likely changes must be weighed against the potential detriment to the child or children caused by the litigation itself. thus, for example, small changes may not have sufficient benefit to compensate for the disruption caused by significant re-litigation.
if applied on a preliminary basis, the issue is whether the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence reveal a change of such significance that the best interests of the child require a revisiting of earlier orders.
... we are far from persuaded that the hurdles that have to be overcome to found a successful challenge on the basis of the weight afforded to the evidence have been scaled. it has consistently been held that where no error of fact or law is present, disagreement only on matters of weight cannot alone justify appellate interference....
this analysis leads us to the view that where the principle in rice & asplund is being considered, it will not be appropriate or necessary to discretely address many of the factors in section 60cc of the act in determining where the best interests of the child might lie.
in a case where the principle in rice arises for consideration, there are two circumstances which are central to the decision. first, there will already exist a parenting order and, axiomatically, the terms of that order will reflect the best interests of the child or children at the time of its making. second, the fact that an order has been made reflects that disputation between parties to a parenting dispute, such dispute being inherently contrary to the best interests of the child whilst it exists, has been brought to an end by a curial order. those twin circumstances dictate the conclusion that it cannot logically be in the best interests of the child to embark upon further litigation enquiring as to the child’s best interests unless it is first demonstrated that a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred since the parenting order was made.
thus, it is entirely understandable, and in our view, not erroneous, for his honour to address the issue of “best interests” by reference to whether it is in the interests of the child for there to be the further litigation proposed by the mother. indeed, we note that this was how the issue was framed in the mother’s outline of argument presented to his honour at the commencement of the hearing. she said this (at paragraph 3):
the central question for consideration by the court was encapsulated by warnick j in the following terms (para 81, at page 310):
“... though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought to be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child’s welfare than to allow the application to continue.” ] where the question of whether a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred is to be determined as a matter preliminary to the hearing of the application, it is accepted that the applicant’s evidence should be taken at its highest. [52] it was argued for the mother that his honour erred in finding that she had failed to demonstrate a sufficient change in circumstances to justify re-opening the parenting proceedings. [53] his honour concluded at [100] that the facts did not establish “a new and vital change in the circumstances”, and found that it was “obvious” that y had been anxious for some time and that anxiety had from time to time manifested itself in her refusing to go to school. he went on to offer what he considered to be the reasons for this, including that she had recently commenced high school. he thus found at [111] that the mother’s evidence did not establish a material change of circumstances in the necessary sense. [54] the bar to appellate intervention where the challenge is to a judge’s fact finding is set high. see edwards v noble (1971) 125 clr 296. [55] in order to succeed in challenging his honour’s finding that there had been no change in circumstances, it is necessary to demonstrate that the finding was not open to his honour on the evidence before him. [56] thus it was argued that, had his honour indeed taken the mother’s evidence at its highest it was not open to him to find that there had been no material change in circumstances. it was further argued that both his honour’s conclusion that the child had always been anxious, and that her present refusal to attend school was a manifestation of a pre-existing condition and was probably due to her attending a new school, were findings unsupported by the evidence. [57] his honour’s finding that the child’s present anxiety and refusal to attend school was unsupported by the evidence. however, it was a conclusion reasonably open to his honour given the accepted increase in her refusing to attend school and anxiety generally with the beginning of a new school regime. it could not be said that the conclusion was not open to his honour. his honour’s findings clearly accept the parties’ position that y’s anxiety and school refusal had escalated. the issue for his honour was whether these circumstances led to the conclusion that there had been a material change in circumstances. his honour found that they did not. that was a determination open to him and i find no error in his conclusion. this challenge is not made out.  ] in any event, while the arguments in support of the contention are framed as challenges to “principles” relating to the rule, they are, in essence, challenges to the weight which his honour attached to aspects of the evidence. [84] in my view, the findings made by his honour were entirely open to him on the evidence and it was entirely open to his honour to include the matters to which his honour made reference in reaching a determination that a material change in circumstances was not established. [85] in that respect, it has been held recently that:
... plainly a circumstance can only constitute a relevant 'change' if it is a circumstance which was outside or beyond the contemplation or consideration of the parties and the court at the time the original parenting orders were made. put another way, if the current circumstances were within the contemplation of the parties and were considered by the court at the time the original parenting orders were made, there is no basis upon which they can be said to constitute a change which would justify the prospect of continuing litigation with respect to parenting arrangements, given the adverse effect which uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to parenting arrangements can be assumed to have upon the interests of the child concerned...[29]  ] in my view his honour made no error as asserted on behalf of the mother.  0] the exercise of those discretions will depend, like all discretionary decisions, on a multiplicity of factors. however, the decisions will include a consideration of the nature and cogency of the evidence as to material change and the nature and extent of the orders sought to be changed. the decisions will also ordinarily involve a consideration of the notorious fact – accepted as such both by authority and by mr north in his arguments – that continued litigation and the re-agitation of contested issues about children has the potential to cause significant harm to them. [111] in some cases, those factors, and perhaps others, will persuade a court that further evidence is required before reaching a decision on the rice & asplund question. the obtaining of a family report in an appropriate case might be an example of such further evidence, although it once again needs to be pointed out that family reports do not decide cases, courts do. [112] however, the court’s decision as to the evidence necessary to decide the application of “the rule in rice & asplund” as a preliminary matter also involves the exercise of discretion. the exercise of that discretion will also have as its central question whether it is “more powerfully in the child[ren’s] welfare” to permit the obtaining of the further evidence – and what might be involved for the children in doing so – than to determine the application of the rule as a preliminary matter without that evidence. that can be seen to have particular importance when the evidence sought is a family report or the interventions of other experts that involve the participation of the children. [113] it should also be pointed out (as it was by this court in miller & harrington), that the relevant discretions must now be exercised within the mandatory principles and other provisions contained within division 12a of the act. in that respect two of the mandatory principles which must be applied by a court by reference to s 69zn of the act bear quotation:   the first principle is that the court is to consider the needs of the child concerned and the impact that the conduct of the proceedings may have on the child in determining the conduct of the proceedings. (4) the second principle is that the court is to actively direct, control and manage the conduct of the proceedings.  4] in my view, contrary to the submissions made by mr north, well settled authority is entirely consistent with his honour having the power to apply “the rule in rice & asplund” as a preliminary matter “... even where the evidence demonstrates a material change since the previous order”. [115] secondly, again contrary to mr north’s submissions, it is in my view not correct to characterise his honour’s actions or decisions as a failure or refusal to exercise jurisdiction in proceedings for parenting orders properly invoked by the mother. the refusal by his honour to contemplate the obtaining of a family report (or, perhaps, other evidence) so as to inform the rule at a preliminary stage was not a failure of judicial process but a discretionary decision performed within a mandatory statutory context and arrived at by reference to the children’s best interests for reasons which his honour gave. [116] it is not established that his honour erred in law, that he failed to take account of relevant considerations, that he took account of irrelevant considerations or committed any other discretionary error. no error in the exercise of his honour’s discretion is pleaded nor can any be seen in his honour’s reasons.
i consider any differences between the two phrases as semantic and not substantial. as the authorities make clear, the essential point in the application of the rule in rice and asplund is the balancing of the new circumstances against the undesirability of further litigation involving the child. the nature of that exercise will depend very much upon the nature of the changes relied upon. obviously enough, if there are no changes or if the changes are insignificant or unsubstantial, there will be little to justify reconsideration of the earlier orders.
these authorities make clear that a change in circumstances is not itself the answer to the question as to whether the earlier parenting orders should be reconsidered, but that those new matters, in all of the circumstances, must be sufficient to justify or to provide for such a hearing.
... we should emphasise that the magnitude of the variation of the parenting orders sought to be achieved in the fresh proceedings, necessarily informs the nature of change of circumstances sufficient to justify that re-litigation. here, the mother was seeking a complete reversal of the child’s living arrangements, rather than merely some minor tinkering or slender change to the new zealand orders. therefore, the nature of the change in circumstances needed to be of sufficient gravity to warrant the wholesale re-litigation of the child’s living arrangements. on no view did the mother’s claims come close to demonstrating a sufficient change. taking her case at its highest, it had no reasonable likelihood of success.  ] in defrey & radnor [2021] famcafc 67after considering what was said in sps and pls [2008] famcafc 16, (2008) 39 fam lr 295 at [81] and [84], miller & harrington [2008] famcafc 16, (2008) 39 fam lr 295 at [105] and marsden v winch at [58] the full court summarised the law concerning rice and asplund as follows:  ] in our view, the rice & asplund test applies to all applications which seek to revisit parenting orders. sometimes the test will be easily satisfied even though the issues to reconsider are major ones and sometimes the test will be easily satisfied even though the issues to be revisited are relatively minor in character. in both situations, the overarching test is to be applied, namely, (having regard to the best interests of the child) new events or changed circumstances have to be sufficient to provoke a new inquiry. ]20] it is also useful when considering, as a preliminary matter, what issues a parent might be permitted to re-litigate, to remember that under s.69zq(1)(a) of the family law act (cth) (“the act”), there is a mandatory requirement to decide which of these issues in the proceedings require full investigation and hearing. [21] the rule in rice & asplund involves the exercise of discretion and not merely a process of making factual findings. that is because the “rule” is a manifestation of the best interests principle. all s.60cc(2) and (3) matters, so far as they are relevant, must be considered, to the extent that they can be, based on the material before the court. the rule focuses particularly on s.60cc(3)(1) and the preference to make final orders in parenting matters that are least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child. axiomatically that is because unless other considerations are more weighty, it is not in the best interests of a child for that child to be the subject of repeated litigation between his/her parents. there is a focus in an application of this kind upon the change(s) in circumstances that outweigh the negative impact of reopening litigation. although when considering the preliminary issue, if cross-examination is not permitted, then the evidence of the father is to be taken at its highest, and it is not only the father’s evidence that is considered. [22] consequently, the challenge to the primary judge’s discretionary decision is one to which the normal principles in house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and gronow v gronow [1979] hca 63, (1979) 144 clr 513 apply. the primary judge’s task was a two-staged process. first, to make findings of fact as to what changes there had been in circumstances since the making of the 2015 orders and secondly, to assess whether or not the father had established that these changes are sufficient to provoke a new inquiry, or put in another way, whether the father has established a prima facie case of changed circumstances that would justify embarking on a second contested parenting hearing as being in the child’s best interests.
consideration and disposition
... if the court orders for [x] to continue have communication and/or time with [x] in the case that he poses a risk to her and that risk eventuates into harm for her (psychological, emotional and/or physical harm), the impact on [x]’s psychological and emotional wellbeing will be severe. it will reinforce her anxieties that she has expressed and cause distrust for her in the relationships that she has sought safety, for example her relationship with the mother. implications of this could manifest by way of increased poor mental health and other trauma impacts and should therefore be considered with significant weight.  ] the rule in rice & asplund involves the exercise of discretion and not merely a process of making factual findings. that is because the “rule” is a manifestation of the best interests principle. all s.60cc(2) and (3) matters, so far as they are relevant, must be considered, to the extent that they can be, based on the material before the court...
