such behaviour must still meet the definition as contained within s 4ab (1).
123. coerce is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as to restrain or constrain by force, law or authority, force or compel, as to do something. to compel by forcible action control is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as:
1. to exercise restraint or direction over, dominate, command the phrase “coerces or controls” is expressed disjunctively. however, it may be seen that the two concepts are closely related. together they form an expanded concept of the exercise of power, to restrain another or to cause another to act, by force, domination or command...
generally, coercive control is understood as a course of conduct aimed at dominating and controlling another person, including a family member.
the assessment of whether conduct that falls within one of the provided examples constitutes family violence as defined in s 4ab (1) of the act necessarily requires that conduct to be considered in the context in which it occurred.  ] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) – something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act – the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent.
meaningful relationship
...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...  2] ...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
family violence
the father’s firearm ownership
counsel for the mother: one reason you might have deliberately remained silent is because you know it sparks fear in [the mother] don’t you? father: no, that’s not true. counsel for the mother: you could have allayed that fear, couldn’t you, by a simple paragraph in your affidavit drawing a close to the issue of [firearms] if they’d been transferred. father: i wasn’t sure that was the best thing to do.
general findings as to the father’s behaviour
you created me and [ms salvador] and you authored our marriage. it was created under your blessing and we both committed to live by your rule. i have failed. i am sorry. i’m sorry for: losing my temper and living for myself creating an environment where [ms salvador] feels unsafe, unloved and constantly hurt. raising my voice when i want to be heard. saying hurtful words that i know will pierce [ms salvador’s] heart and gain a reaction. being irresponsible with our finances and treating your creation with contempt by being destructive with our belongings. making [ms salvador] feel inadequate (mentally, socially, physically). making promises to my wife and breaking them instantly. caring what other people think of me before i care about what is right for our family and what honours you. hiding my sin from you. treating you like you don’t exist and living for my sinful self. rejecting all the good godly people you’ve put in my life. threatening [ms salvador] with self-harm or making her feel anxious because of threats to take my life. having such a small view of the value of life and for thinking it is acceptable to dishonour you this way. cursing you and your name. shirking my responsibilities as a man, husband and leader being caught up in worldly desires and not kingdom oriented desires. manipulating situations to get my way and making [ms salvador] feel bad for not submitting to my sinful desires. all of these things point to a deep spiritual problem where i have...[8]
specific findings as to the parties’ behaviour
mother: that really scared me [mr salvador]. i’m so worried about you. father: i would never really hurt myself. i just did that to get your attention.
father: i don't care anymore! this is done! if it means i lose my christianity, i don't give a fuck! i am done! mother: please come out! i am sorry for leaving! i am sorry i didn't speak to you over the last 2 days! father: i've asked you to talk 5 times over the last 2 days and you still don't want to do it! for fucks sake! i don't want this. i'm struggling at work, i'm struggling with my marriage, i'm struggling with my family and i'm struggling at church. i do not want to live.
this baby is going to die because of your spitefulness. you have been put in charge of a baby and you're doing a horrible job of it. you are stressing for no reason, which is harming the baby. it's as if when the baby is born, you're just grabbing a knife and stabbing it. if there was the technology available to take that tiny little pea 3mm baby out of your belly. and grow it in someone elses, or grow it in a freaking petri dish, i would do that in a heartbeat.
hey [mr salvador], please call me back asap. otherwise, i’ll try [...] to get through to you. thanks ... i am applying for an avo. i’ll see you in court. ... i have nothing to lose. i don’t care anymore. i want to die, i want this baby dead, i want to disappear out of your life for good.[17]
i am on my way to abort our child and then i am going to kill myself. this is your fault ... i am going to expose you at work. i will ruin you and there will be nothing left of you when i am done. you will be burnt to a crisp.
at the above time and date the victim attended [suburb c] police station to report a verbal argument that occurred with the pn. he wished for a record to be made. the victim stated they argued due to the pn gamily getting to involved in their relationship. police spoke with the pn who agreed with the victim. nil offences disclosed. nil injuries obtained. verbal only.[19]
dear [j company], i am the wife of [mr salvador] who works as an assistant [...]. as a company that stands for just causes, it should be known that i am a victim of [mr salvador’s] physical, verbal, and sexual abuse. many times, i have been verbally abused by him during his work hours at [j company], over the phone or via text message. his work phone has also been used to perpetrate abuse. the abuse has been particularly apparent during my recent pregnancy. i am taking this case further with him. but it should be brought to the company’s attention that as a representative of [j company], the infliction of abuse caused by their staff member [mr salvador] during business hours was horrific. i will need to take this further if nothing further is done about it.[21]
please don’t make me do this if i don’t hear from you in the next 5 mins i will have to send.
that’s not what was said...the situation sounds like it’s true but that is not what i responded with.

the father’s financial dealings post separation and breach of injunctive orders
disposal of the monies held in the parties’ joint account
at the time i was trying to figure out the best way to support [x] financially, i was aware that [ms salvador] required that to support [x], i wasn’t sure of the best way to do that. i was led by previous conversations where [ms salvador] had said that she would ruin me financially and burn me to the ground and i was really challenged by - how do i ensure that the finances that are here in the account go to supporting him and my main concerns were what did i think was fair, and what did i think was best for [x].
the father’s disposal of shares and cryptocurrency
a. [f investments] account ending [#...83], and b. [g investments] account ending [#...11]. the husband be permitted to sell shares and otherwise deal with assets held in the [h investments] account ending in account number [#...09] so that: - the husband may receive monies from the sale or dealing with such shares to the total sum and value of $18,000.00.
counsel for the mother: do i have to go through the rest [of the transactions] or do you make the concession that you did- father: i just can’t make that concession, i did sell shares and crypto. counsel for the mother: notwithstanding the injunction? father: that’s right.
the father’s financial assistance post separation
on 8 november 2020, i obtained a child support administrative assessment which required [mr salvador] to pay me the sum of approximately $271 per week by way of child support. i initially sought informal financial assistance from [mr salvador], however, each time that i requested funds, he refused as he did not want to give me cash, but wanted to purchase the provisions himself. i felt that this was his way of trying to control me and how i spent money for [x]. i was also concerned that he wanted to purchase important items for [x] that were second hand.
mother: [mr salvador], i don't think you have been supporting [x] and i financially. you have taken $60,000 out of our joint account, which means i cannot afford to buy essential items to look after [x]. my mother and aunt have had to assist in purchasing nappies and wipes, as i cannot afford them since i am not working and looking after [x] full time and i cannot rely on you to help provide these things. you promised that you would repay me". father: i will not repay anything you or your family have paid for, unless you have them sit down with me and show me what they bought and how much money exactly was spent on these items".
father: are you receiving centrelink payments yet and have you applied for paid parental leave? father: you have to answer me yes or no otherwise i won't leave. you are spending my money! mother: please put [x] down in the bassinet rather than argue over the top of him. [x] needs a breastfeed soon. can i encourage you to text message me later about this instead. father: i won't give [x] back unless you answer yes or no! mother: please stop shouting. i feed him at 8pm at the end of your visit when you leave and it's past 8pm now. father: i want an extra half an hour with him and i'm entitled to that as his dad. the agreement we made is irrelevant. you've broken the agreement numerous times as well so it doesn't matter. i'm entitled to stay for as long as i want! mother: i need to feed [x]! father: no he doesn't need a feed. i'm his dad and i say that he's not ready for a feed unless he cries. mother: he needs a feed and you need to hand him back so he can have a feed. father: i'm going to close off all the accounts unless you answer my question. as of tomorrow the accounts will be shut and you won't have access to money. mother: fine. stay with [x] and i will be back at 8:30 pm.
x’s enrolment in preschool
mother: [x] is doing another orientation on friday, i will have forms and info on fees by then. father: what are the forms? mother: enrolment forms .... father: just as a heads up i’m being supporting of him being in preschool, however i’m not comfortable signing anything until we’ve finalised our agreement with court stuff. depending on the amount i’m potentially happy to pay for all the fees but i can’t make any calls with all my money tied up at the moment in legal fees and financial settlement. i suggest we wait until we have a final financial agreement before we sign his enrolment forms. mother: as far as i’ve been made aware, the enrolment forms are separate to the debit forms for fees. are you saying you’re happy for him to attend but can’t pay? he’s ready and excited to start, i don’t think it’s fair to hold him back because of court. if you can’t pay i’ll pay. father: i’m saying i like the idea of him going to preschool, but i am not comfortable signing any forms at all without progression on the financial settlement. understand that he is excited and that you are too. i believe the best thing for him at the moment is for us to reach a final agreement. it shouldn’t be too difficult. mother: i don’t see what the connection is between [x] ready to start preschool and a financial settlement. father: we could get it done by next week [thumbs up emoji]. ...... father: i don’t see what the issue here is [ms salvador]. you can infer that [x] is being dragged into this but that’s the nature of coparenting. we can’t possibly make big decisions without finalising our separation. it’s been three years i have made multiple fair offers to you.....my position won’t change: the absolute best thing for him is for us to finalise our agreement. everything else is secondary and only leaves room for more mess. mother: ...[x] is two and as far as he is concerned he’s starting preschool next week. our disputes shouldn’t have anything to do with him starting school.... father: ....the only relationship i want to benefit is the one between me and my son. i’m not comfortable signing any forms at this stage sorry. you’ve had three years to finalise everything and you’ve refused. more harm has been done to [x] in that time than holding him back from preschool until you can make an agreement.[38]
counsel: [the mother] said there is no connection between financial settlement and being ready for preschool? father: only with respect to how much i could pay. counsel: but she offered to pay? father: then no counsel: then there is no connection? father: i didn’t believe that at the time.
your actions have destroyed my reputation and out of respect for your dignity i have refrained from sharing the details with anyone. given the long term impact this is having on me, i will do this no longer. for anyone that wants to understand the reality of our situation and why my relationship with [x] is fractured, i will share the details of what is happening..... ..... your actions and attitude towards me as his father are bitter, horrible and extremely hurtful. you should be ashamed. [40]
i am writing out of concern due to your clients recent enrolment of [x] in [y school]. i received a message from your client yesterday morning at 10:30am to let me know yesterday was [x's] first day at preschool. furthermore your client did not include my details in the enrolment process, resulting in me being unable to receive updates and important information about [x] including his schedule, updates/photos of his classes, upcoming parent events, etc. i have since reached out directly to [y school] to add my details as his parent. to be clear, as i have expressed to your client, i am supportive of [x] attending preschool as i believe this has multiple benefits for him, including [x] socialising with other children, [x] engaging in an early childhood learning program, and your client increasing her capacity to work. however i expect to be part of the decisions that relate to [x's] education and for these decisions to be made jointly. outside of your client's obligation under the existing orders and legislation, her behaviour represents a lack of willingness to support a healthy co-parenting arrangement and an attempt to gain control. as i have outlined in previous emails this kind of behaviour is at odds with the orders that were agreed to and significantly increases the risk of further conflict. it is not in [x's] best interest. please also note that i no longer have the means to pay for legal representation, hence the reason why [z lawyers] are no longer representing me. this causes me great concern given the amount of resources that have already been spent in relation to my parenting matters with your client. given my inability to access legal advice for this reason, your client's recent enrolment of [x] in pre-school without my knowledge or consent, along with her recent actions relating to my time with [x], comes across as an attempt to capitalise on this. to summarise, your client seems to have zero concern for the orders that she agreed to or her obligations under the family law act. your client's most recent behaviour, including what is contained in my previous emails, is in direct contravention of the orders and represents a contradiction of the most fundamental aspects of co-parenting, access to children, promotion of healthy communication, provision of medical information, joint decision making and equal shared parental responsibility. i therefore put your client on notice that due to her continued refusal to facilitate time between [x] and myself, her non-disclosure of medical updates, her non-disclosure of [x's] new enrolment in education, along with your clients refusal to respond to my attempts to resolve these issues over the course of this year, i intend to submit a contravention application to the federal circuit and family court of australia.
hi [...], regarding the email below, just coming back on next monday. while [x] is typically at preschool for the two-hour block on mondays his attendance this coming monday 31st october will be a breach of court orders which have been in place for 14 months. i am hopeful there are other times you can facilitate school photos that [x’s] mother can agree to. i am also happy to help where i can. apologies for putting you in the middle of this, but just making sure you’re across the details in lieu of any litigation that will inevitably take place in the event of court order contraventions. since the court orders are interim only and there is plans to prepare final parenting orders, is there a best contact for whom my solicitor can talk to about your compliance framework, subpoenas, requests to witness in court, etc. moving forward? thanks, [mr salvador][41]
i’m happy to contribute, though for now the child support should cover the cost of this. you should have received an email response to get your agreement for a final financial settlement. as long as we can’t reach an agreement it’s going to be very hard for me to agree to extra costs.
given that your client has not provided financial disclosure in over 9 months, i request that she promptly send me her most recent financial disclosure as per her obligations in the orders. .... i request your client focus her attention on a final financial proposal which will not only allow me to be in a position to sharing in [x’s] education costs (over and above the child support she is receiving from me) but will also allow your client to receive a portion of the asset pool...[42]
complaints made by the father to the police, the office of the legal services commission and the church diocese
having considered the matter in accordance with clause 35 of the ministry standards ordinance 2017 the psc resolved that no further action be taken pursuant to clause 36(b) because in its view, on the balance of probabilities, the complaint was vexatious and/or lacked substance and credibility.... this matter is now concluded and i will be writing to [mr salvador] to advise him of the outcome.[45]
the father’s current wife
i believe that my relationship with [ms l] has been a great source of aggravation for [ms salvador] and has contributed to her behaviour over the last 12 months, including her attempts to limit my time with [x], and her proposal for final orders sought. [in early] 2023 [ms l] sent a message to [ms salvador] to indicate that she wanted to support [ms salvador] and i as we co-parent [x].[46]
i would love to get to a place where we can have open communication with each other. i want to do what i can to help you and [mr salvador] co-parent in the best way that we can, for [x].[47]
hi [x]. thank you for the message. i appreciate you reaching out however i would like to verify that this is really you before we communicate any further. hope you understand.
...for a number of reasons i don’t feel comfortable texting but like i said earlier i’m happy to meet up in person or chat over the phone. i understand if you’re not comfortable though (i’m sure you’ve been fed plenty of untruths about me). just know i’m happy to communicate that way and i truly do appreciate the message.
mother: despite your questionable timing i wanted to trust that your message was sincere. it is now clear that your only intention in sending it was to annex it to [mr salvador’s] affidavit the very next day. i may have considered believing some of what you said, had it not been included. disingenuous and extremely disappointing. please do not contact me again. [ms l]: hi [ms salvador], my contact is not disingenuous, but it is a part of the ongoing issue. i have been considering your request to meet up in person and determining how i feel about it. i am still in the process of thinking it through and will reach out when i’ve made a decision. mother: you have had ample time to reach out, and now the first contact is only 2 weeks before mine and [mr salvador’s] court case and gets put straight into an affidavit. if you were genuine you would have left it out. i retract my offer. i no longer feel comfortable.
harm/abuse
the additional considerations
any views expressed by x
the nature of x’s relationship with the parties and other significant persons  appears to have a close, warm relationship with [ms salvador], in which he receives emotional support, stability, and a sense of safety. it appears that [x] is developing a close and warm relationship with [mr salvador], and that [mr salvador] is developing close bond with [x]. [50]
the capacity of each party to provide for x’s needs and their demonstrated attitude to the responsibilities of parenthood
the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with the child
i put your client on notice that upon her failure to do this (alongside the dozens of previous cases of missed time in the last 6 months) i will be submitting an application of contravention.
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent's obligations to maintain the child
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances including the effect of any separation from the father
it is likely that [x] would experience a number of negative emotional states in the short-term arising from [mr salvador’s] absence from his life. although [ms salvador] could fulfil [x’s] parenting needs, [x] could grow up experiencing greater or lesser conflicted feelings, depended upon his age and development as he grows up, about [mr salvador’s] absence from his life. [x’s] understanding about [mr salvador’s] absence from his life would likely grow and change as he becomes older and moves through different stages of development. if the court orders no time, [ms salvador] may therefore wish to seek the assistance of a therapeutic or counsellor to provide [x] with an explanation about his parenting arrangements, conducive to his age and stage of development and will which support his development of a healthy sense of identity and self-worth.[66]
whether it would be preferable to make an order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
any other fact or circumstance
disposition
parental responsibility
the apparent high level of conflict, mistrust and animosity between the parents is a contraindication to equal shared parental responsibility. it is hence recommended that an order be made providing [ms salvador] with sole parental responsibility for [x].
time with orders
if the court finds [ms salvador’s] description of [mr salvador’s] family violence to have veracity however, which included threats to report [ms salvador], herself, to dcj, then it is conceivable that [mr salvador’s] actions in reporting [x] to dcj were an act of system’s abuse.[68]
...suffer insecurity, fear, unhappiness, anxiety and hypervigilance from witnessing abusive behaviour of a parent. such effects present a threat to their emotional development. probably the worst danger to children is the role model that a violent parent provides which can lead to children themselves coming to suffer the serious social disability of using violence in their dealings with other people including those they love. such a disability can destroy the most intimate relationships and bring the person into conflict with other people, the police and the law...
could result in permanent injury, disability, or lethal outcomes.
counsel for the mother: the father has agreed, after being taken through it in evidence, that over the period july 2021 through to august 2022 he disposed of all these assets in the face of an injunction. are you able to express an opinion about what that tells us about his attitude to authority? cce: well, it’s actually - if the court finds [mr salvador] to be displaying coercive and controlling behaviour - it actually highlights that his need to coerce and control is greater than his ability to comply with authority. which is quite dangerous really. counsel for the mother: any why is it quite dangerous? cce: if someone is unwilling to comply with external restraints put upon them by an authority such as the police or the legal system, it means that safety can’t be increased by using those means in terms of protecting victims.
at [x’s] age and stage of development, any exposure to family violence, including verbal abuse, whether by one or both of his parents could undermine his sense of safety and stability in his world. [x] is of the age, and stage of development, where he is reliant on his parents to meet his basic care needs, and provide him with a safe and stable care environment. if one or both of [x’s] parents are distracted by family violence, whether or not one or both parents are responsible for the family violence, each of the parents’ ability to attend to [x’s] basic care needs and ensure that [x] is safe, and feels safe, may be compromised. due to the anxiety, fear, and instability a child may experience when exposed to parental family violence, their ability to regulate their own emotional and behavioural states and engage in their environment, in ways that support healthy growth and development, may be affected. the development of self-regulation is a skill which, at [x’s] age and stage of development, forms in the context of parental relationships that are empathic, nurturing, and stable. a child’s self-regulation is a key foundational skill for other developmental domains, including the ability to focus and learn at school, develop prosocial peer relationships, and develop healthy, functional relationships into the future. [69]   salvador] did not view himself as needing to attend an anger management program, but had believed that the program he had attended would be considered acceptable as a men’s behaviour change program. he presented his experiences of attending such a program as going through the steps for the purpose of the parenting proceedings. when sharing information about what he gained from his attendance at such a program, [mr salvador] intellectualised his experience, and spoke about how he could apply the concept of self-regulation to his parenting of [x]. it can be considered beneficial that [mr salvador] gained some knowledge about the importance of assisting [x] in his emotional and behavioural regulation. however, if the court finds [ms salvador’s] claims of family violence to be accurate, then [mr salvador’s] attendance an anger management program would have appeared to have had no, or minimal effect on [mr salvador’s] belief system. parents who perpetrate family violence often have an underlying belief system, which justifies their perpetration of family violence.

she further opined that:
if the court finds [ms salvador’s] description of [mr salvador’s] family violence to be accurate, then [mr salvador’s] attitude about the applicability of an anger management program to his life would indicate a belief system underpinning the family violence that is quite entrenched and resistant to change through a group therapeutic approach. the risks to [x] associated with [mr salvador’s] alleged perpetration of family violence could undermine the positive aspects that [mr salvador] could contribute to [x’s] development. by way of example, exposure to the dynamics of family violence could undermine the stability in both of [x’s] parental relationships, undermine [x’s] sense of stability and safety in the world, and contribute to [x] developing an unhealthy, or dysfunctional, self-concept. it could also lead to [x] replicating the same belief system as [mr salvador], and contributing to the development of dysfunctional and unhealthy relationships with others as a child and an adult. [72]  ] importantly, the full court in marra held that not only is it necessary for the court to determine whether a parent has a genuine concern about the welfare of the child in the care of the other parent but it is also necessary to determine whether the concerned parent’s parenting capacity will be “discernibly impaired”. ‘discernibly’, or similar expressions that have been used in the relevant authorities to which we have referred, means no more than being an evident or detectable impairment in parenting capacity such that there is an unacceptable risk that the child’s welfare will be adversely impacted.
...the first enquiry is whether there is objectively an unacceptable risk. if there is the court must take steps proportionate to the degree of risk. if there is not, the court may then need to consider whether the residence parent has a genuinely held belief that such a risk exists and whether that will have a significant impact on that party’s capacity as the resident parent and so impinge on the best interests of the children. the court then needs to take steps proportionate to that circumstance...
should the court find that [mr salvador] is perpetrating family violence against [ms salvador] and that this family violence is creating, or increasing anxiety, for [ms salvador], [ms salvador’s] anxiety could have secondary affects for [x]. anxiety can affect a parents’ capacity to be in tune with their children’s thoughts, feelings, and needs. in this way, parental anxiety can affect the parent-child relationship in ways that impact a child’s health and development across multiple domains, including their self-concept, self-esteem, their performance at school, and their relationships with their peers. children may also be at greater risk of developing anxiety of their own.

her distress had placed her depression levels into the moderate range of severity, her anxiety within the severe range of anxiety and her stress levels appeared to remain within the normal range (severity moves on a continuum from normal to moderate, severe an finally extremely severe). [76]

injunctive orders
the costs of the independent children’s lawyer   to avoid doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children's lawyer in respect of the proceedings. (4) however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if: (a) a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,   however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if: (a) a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,   a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,   the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,
the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children's lawyer.  ] in construing the subsection it should be observed that the operative circumstance is unqualified. it does not suggest that the party must currently be in receipt of legal aid, or in receipt of legal aid for a particular portion of the proceedings. it is expressed simply in the past tense.
