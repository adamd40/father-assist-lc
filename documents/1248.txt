consideration
the financial circumstances of the parties
the court can only speculate whether the wife received an increase in her salary. whatever the quantum may be the evidence before the court is that the wife receives a salary of $62,972.00. irrespective of the potential quantum increase, i consider that the husband is in a better position than the wife in relation to future considerations. he can adjust his income to meet his needs, pay himself dividends as required, he is in a relationship with [ms z], and they are already intermingling the payment of their joint expenses.

having regard to the wife’s income i am of the view that it would have been difficult for her to pay for her and [mr h’s] living expenses and also meet the mortgage repayments for that 14 month period. from an income which the husband asserts was $3,214.00 per month, if the wife had paid the mortgage she would have had $310.00 per month left to pay for all other expenses. the wife deposes that from october 2020 until april 2021 her average weekly expenses, excluding the mortgage repayments were $833.00. this equates to approximately $3,332.00 per month. again there was insufficient income from which she could meet the mortgage payments.   there are justifying circumstances supporting that the wife should pay the husband’s costs of all three items having regard to section 117(2a)(c) and (g) as contended by the husband, and (b) there are no justifying circumstances supporting that the husband should pay the wife’s costs in relation to his application in a case.   there are no justifying circumstances supporting that the husband should pay the wife’s costs in relation to his application in a case.

whether either party has made an offer in writing to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer
...offers must be seen in the context of the case and the extent of the offeree’s knowledge of the parties’ financial circumstances while the offer is live. in the family law jurisdiction, it is not uncommon to find relationships where one party, often the wife, has significantly less grasp of the parties’ financial arrangements, or the financial circumstances are so complex that it would be premature to accept an offer. there are also cases where the contents of the offer are in themselves the subject of disputed value and legitimate subject matter for determination. these and other features of the context of offers must be taken into account when considering whether it was reasonable or not to accept an offer, no matter how close to the ultimate result the offer may be.
