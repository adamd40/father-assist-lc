annexure "a"
reasons for judgment
judge glass:
parenting
primary considerations
the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents
the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
despite this injunction, [in late] 2023, [y] returned from spending time with [mr lawrie], and advised me and [z] that [mr lawrie] had a glass of wine whilst at dinner. [y] was upset and disappointed that her father was drinking. [z] then told me that due to [y]'s comment, she is now too scared to be in [mr lawrie’s] care. the children have told me repeatedly that they are fearful of [mr lawrie] when he drinks.[4]
... the writer is aware of the burden of disloyalty that also clearly appears to overwhelm these children. the writer held the impression that these highly confused young children have been inappropriately involved in their parent’s dispute, and more worrisome, embroiled as the subject of their parent’s conflict (especially for [x])...[8]
additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to their views
... [z] does not want any pressure to spend overnight time with her father, reporting that [mr lawrie] often asks her ‘on the spot’. she feels there is little choice other than to agree with him, as she reported ‘he doesn’t take no for an answer’. [z] also expressed concern that ‘if i say yes and i mean no, because i can’t say it to him, not wanting to hurt his feelings’, as she has not expressed to him her worries and concerns (ie. ‘he would get drunk and start yelling at me, randomly, for no reason’). nevertheless, [z] was open to commence overnights next year (‘i would consider it’), seeking no change to the current arrangement, aware that her siblings remain resistant to see their father, she expressed a wish not to spend any length of time separated from them.[10] ... when the writer asked how she would feel if someone else made the decision that she is to spend overnight with the father, she became emotional reporting, ‘that would be the worst thing’.[11]   returned from these sleepovers anxious and depressed. she expressed to me that she had thoughts of self-harm and suicide. [z] has since refused to return for a sleepover at [mr lawrie]'s home.[14]   has told me that she does not wish any increase of time with her father. whilst [z] has told me that she wishes to maintain having a relationship with her father, she is uncomfortable in his company due to his unpredictability and his past behaviours.[15] (emphasis added)
the nature of the children’s relationships with each of their parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to them, to spend time with them, and to communicate with them
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of any changes in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect on them of any separation from either of their parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom they have been living
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the children’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the children’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of the children, to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of their parents, and any other relevant characteristics of the children
if the children are aboriginal child or a torres strait islander children, their right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to the children, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of their parents
any family violence involving the children or a member of their family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the children or a member of their family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the children
any other relevant fact or circumstance

current liabilities
... the court may take the view that because of the circumstances surrounding the incurring of the liability it ought in justice and equity to be wholly or partly disregarded in determining the appropriate order to make under sec. 79 as between the parties to the marriage. such a result could be reached where a spouse had incurred a liability in deliberate or reckless disregard of the other party's potential entitlement under sec. 79.[30]
... the manner in which a particular liability should be treated is, ultimately, dependent upon the nature of the liability, the circumstances surrounding the liability and the dictates of justice and equity shaped by each. the usual practice or “rule” sits comfortably and conformably within that rubric — in many cases, perhaps almost all, liabilities will be deducted from the “gross” value of the property because it will be clear (and even if not expressly stated, determined) that the justice and equity of the case demands that the liabilities should be met by the parties in the proportions in which the court determines the property is to be divided. liabilities that are vague, uncertain, unlikely to be enforced and the like might be treated differently because those circumstances might, in the circumstances of the particular case, render it unjust and inequitable for liabilities to be deducted in that manner. those so-called “exceptional cases” are but instances of the broader consideration of the justice and equity of the particular case.[31]
in the financial year ending 30 june 2022, i derived income from my work with [f pty ltd] totalling approximately $918,533 gross, before tax. this resulted in a shortfall of approximately $120,000 of our total expenses, without allowing for tax. the shortfall was approximately $400,000 once the tax obligations of me, [ms lawrie] and the [lawrie group] are accounted for, which total about $260,000. in the financial year ending 30 june 2023 my income declined for various reasons. i derived income totalling $626,923 gross, before tax. this has resulted in a shortfall of approximately $400,000 between my gross income, and the family's expenses i have had to meet. again, when the tax obligations of me, [ms lawrie] and the [lawrie group] are accounted for, being as estimated at about $200,000, the shortfall is approximately $600,000. the shortfalls between my income, family expenses and our financial commitments over the last 18 months since our separation have been met by borrowings, a part property settlement i received in march 2023 being a loan of $150,000 from nab, drawings on credit cards, and the sale of shares. we have also accumulated arrears in respect of tax, land tax, mortgage repayments and school fees.[37]

if the court orders the sale of an asset, or is satisfied that a sale of it is inevitable, or would probably occur in the near future, or if the asset is one which was acquired solely as an investment and with a view to its ultimate sale for profit, then, generally, allowance should be made for any capital gains tax payable upon such a sale in determining the value of that asset for the purpose of the proceedings.[47]
