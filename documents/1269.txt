reasons for judgment
judge glass:
primary considerations
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both of her parents
the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence   euclid]: there are two significant ones that have been confirmed by the police history. .... [ms euclid]: [mr brantley] and [ms g] were drinking. [x] counted five cans for dad and five cans for [ms g]. she showed me distinctively how far apart they were, that they screaming at each other and why they were screaming. coz [ms g] was on dad’s phone. [ms g] was on dad’s phone. and then [x] told me she can’t tell me anything anymore because dad will get into trouble. now that is concerning for me. .... [ms euclid]: dad kicked [ms g] out, because they were fighting, and [indistinct] late at night with their door open. he hid [ms g]’s keys and [ms g]’s phone. and they were fighting and screaming at each other. [x] came out of her room [indistinct]. she’s just recently told me more. that they’re still fighting and drinking. he’s not showing any regard to not drinking.
five to six cans, [each]... on one occasion... the last occasion i think she said ten.   spoke about being with her father and [ms g]. the writer asked [x] if they ever argue while she is with them. [x] then described an occasion of family violence that she witnessed between them. [x]’s description indicated that her father instigated the violence. [x] denied that she was scared but she observed that [ms g] was crying. [x] was not able to say when this occurred.[9]   late] 2023 police have been notified by a neighbour, that male and female are having a verbal argument inside [...]. on police arrival, police members could hear from outside [...] a verbal dispute. police separated both parties and spoke to the male, where he stated that he is going through a difficult time financially, however he is about to start a new job in the coming weeks. he didn’t realise his voice was loud for the neighbours to hear. the female has stated that they just had a verbal about life and the cost of living and there is nothing for police to worry about. the female was not supportive of any intervention orders and wanted no further police involvement. the female stated that her partner had been living away [...] and this was putting a strain on the relationship.[11]   late 2023], [ms g] was watching [tv] on her phone in her room. both [mr brantley] and [ms g] had been drinking all night. [mr brantley] entered the room and spoke with [ms g], taking the phone from her and inviting her to watch [tv] in the loungeroom with him and his daughter [x]. [ms g] agreed before yelling at [mr brantley] for taking her phone. [ms g] continued to yell and swear at [mr brantley] for his past mistakes and told him she was going to leave and drive home. [mr brantley] grabbed her keys, telling her that she has been drinking all night and that she was in no state to drive. [ms g] continued to yell at [mr brantley]. two of [mr brantley]’s neighbours knocked on the door to check on both parties, concerned over the noise and constant yelling. [mr brantley] stepped outside to talk with one of the neighbours, and [ms g] remained inside. the second neighbour entered the house and talked with [ms g]. police were notified and attended the address [in the evening in late] 2023. police spoke with both parties separately. [mr brantley] stated that he had called a taxi for him and [x] wanting to get away for the night to let [ms g] sleep off the alcohol. [mr brantley] informed police that [ms g] had recently lost a family member and had been struggling with the loss.[12]
while [mr brantley]’s recent significant alcohol use result may represent a setback in his recovery from significant alcohol use, it may also be indicative that [mr brantley] can maintain a low to moderate level of alcohol use while being monitored, but return to excessive alcohol use when not expecting to be assessed.[15]
while it is hoped that [mr brantley] will engage with services to support his recovery from alcohol misuse it is likely to take at least 12 months for any form of recovery to be considered somewhat reliable. having reportedly attended [services] in the past, [mr brantley] should have developed reflective capacity and insight about when his alcohol use is becoming problematic and be able act on it. he had reportedly completed relapse prevention counselling in 2019, but did not appear to have been able to implement whatever he learned.[16]
additional considerations
any views expressed by x and any factors (such as her maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to her views
about any changes to the current arrangements such as who might be upset or not like it if she were to live with her mother mostly and see her father on alternate weekends, [x] did not think she should live with her mother primarily because her father loves her. this was said as a statement but without any affect or sense that [x] was speaking about her own reasons or feelings. there was no body language from [x] that suggested she would be upset herself if she were to live primarily with her mother.[17]
while [x] impressed as at or above expected maturity she is not capable of making decisions about with whom she should live or which school she should attend .... [x] did not indicate her wishes at interview. she spoke only about her father’s wishes. there should be little weight placed on [x]’s response because she appeared to be acting as her father’s messenger. [18]
the nature of x’s relationships with each of her parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative  is likely to have formed an attachment with her father and/or the paternal grandmother within the context of her early childhood history. however, the quality of the attachment is unknown save to say that [x]’s response with her father when she was transitioning to another family member was likely to be indicative of a trauma response or alternatively some degree of coaching.”[19]
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to her, to spend time with her, and to communicate with her
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain her
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances, including the likely effect on her of any separation from either of her parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom she has been living
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect her right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of x’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of x, to provide for her needs, including emotional and intellectual needs  brantley] impressed overall as determining [x]’s needs based on his own needs. in other words, he appeared to struggle to perceive [x] as a separate being to him. minor behaviours from [x] such as determining where the doll would sleep are indicative that she will try to assert herself as a separate individual at some point, albeit she is likely to be confused about her identity because of influence from her father about his pre-eminence in her life.[20] ... [mr brantley] appeared to confuse his feelings about not being with [x] with [x]’s feelings and to project and interpret that [x] feels the same as he does. whether this manipulation is intentional seemed unlikely because [mr brantley] spoke about what he says to [x] and he demonstrated what he says and does during the observations and while [x] was transitioning between the parents. [mr brantley] seemed oblivious to the writer’s observation that he cues [x] to give him a response he wants to hear from her. it was apparent that [mr brantley] has difficulties remaining separate from [x] and therefore in attunement to her as a separate person. [mr brantley] did not appear to understand how that degree of fusion he has with [x] will negatively impact her confidence as she develops. it is likely to create in [x] a need to express a wish to be with her father without understanding why and without being able to develop appropriate independence as she matures. at a minimum this would lead to difficulties in relationships for [x] in her adult life. it may prime her to be vulnerable to family violence towards her.[21]
seemed to be unable to identify that [x]’s behaviours when transitioning from him to other family members were indicative of possible trauma, are not what would be expected from a child aged 5 with a secure attachment with him, and may be indicative of an attachment likely to have been negatively impacted by having been suddenly removed from her mother’s primary care at the age of 18 months and/or alternatively by having her needs met inconsistently.”[23]
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of either of her parents, and any other relevant characteristics of x
if x is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child, her right to enjoy her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to x, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of her parents
any family violence involving x or a member of her family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of her family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility
the parents agree they have been unable to communicate about [x]’s needs. [ms euclid] reported that she tries to contact and speak with [mr brantley] but he refuses to communicate.[30]
conclusions
the current risks of concern to [x] are currently her father’s reportedly high-level use of alcohol and reported family violence with [ms g]. if accepted these reports add support to [ms euclid]’s allegations of a pattern of family violence instigated by [mr brantley] towards her. there are concerns that [x] did not express fear about the family violence she reportedly witnessed and that she may be normalised to family violence.[34]
