joinder of third parties
where the orders sought, establish or recognise a proprietary or security interest in land, chattels or a monetary fund, all persons who have a claim or interest in the subject matter are necessary parties. this is because an order in favour of the claimant will, to a corresponding extent, be detrimental to all others who have or claim an interest.
necessary parties a person whose rights may be directly affected by an issue in a proceeding, and whose participation as a party is necessary for the court to determine all issues in dispute in the proceeding, must be included as a party to the proceeding.
example: if a party seeks an order of a kind referred to in section 90ae or 90af of the family law act, a third party who will be bound by the order must be joined as a respondent to the proceeding.

proposed third respondent’s submissions
“...there was certainly therefore sufficient funds to enable the wife to meet [mr gull]’s claim and there are clearly sufficient funds for the husband to read just whatever arrangements he wished to make if he were to wish to put the title of [suburb h] into his name and substitute his name for the wife’s name.” (transcript, 18 september 2023, page 20).
wife’s submissions
“[the husband] can’t have it both ways. if the money has been advanced to purchase the property, it’s a matrimonial property with a matrimonial debt or neither of them are and that’s why your honour wouldn’t consider joining [mr gull] at this stage or making any of those consequential orders because of those deficiencies in the husband’s present application.” (transcript, 18 september 2023, pages 22 and 23).
