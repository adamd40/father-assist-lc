reasons for judgment
judge taglieri  there were numerous contraventions, and his affidavit material established the relevant non-compliance. because of the number of non-compliances, it was a serious case, (b) there are no simple, clear or predictable principles demonstrative of when breaches of orders and those relating to obligations to make disclosure would constitute a flagrant challenge of the authority of the court, and he considers he has a constitutional duty to pursue the application to clarify the law, and (c) the criteria for a flagrant challenge to the authority of the court should be more stringent than the criteria for the flagrant challenge of a friendship, stating:[3]   there are no simple, clear or predictable principles demonstrative of when breaches of orders and those relating to obligations to make disclosure would constitute a flagrant challenge of the authority of the court, and he considers he has a constitutional duty to pursue the application to clarify the law, and (c) the criteria for a flagrant challenge to the authority of the court should be more stringent than the criteria for the flagrant challenge of a friendship, stating:[3]   the criteria for a flagrant challenge to the authority of the court should be more stringent than the criteria for the flagrant challenge of a friendship, stating:[3]
...ignoring an order once constitutes a challenge to the authority of the court, but ignoring the same order or extension of time for the second time, that should really constitute a flagrant challenge to the authority of the court. also, if various court orders are contravened three times in any six months, or if one order is contravened in an exceptional or striking manner, then a flagrant challenge of the court has been demonstrated.  the respondent did not perceive she had transgressed and was still pleading not guilty, (2) a finding was made that the respondent continued contravening after the contempt application had been filed,[4] (3) the evidence in his affidavit filed 25 may 2023 establishes the alleged contraventions beyond reasonable doubt, and that the court does not need to be satisfied that there was intent to contravene in quasi-criminal cases such as a contempt case, and (4) the fourth element of causation is present in two forms. first, wasting the court’s time and making the court repeat the same order multiple times, and second, frustration and stress to him by spending time and writing repeatedly about the same need to disclose relevant information regarding the property proceedings.   a finding was made that the respondent continued contravening after the contempt application had been filed,[4] (3) the evidence in his affidavit filed 25 may 2023 establishes the alleged contraventions beyond reasonable doubt, and that the court does not need to be satisfied that there was intent to contravene in quasi-criminal cases such as a contempt case, and (4) the fourth element of causation is present in two forms. first, wasting the court’s time and making the court repeat the same order multiple times, and second, frustration and stress to him by spending time and writing repeatedly about the same need to disclose relevant information regarding the property proceedings.   the evidence in his affidavit filed 25 may 2023 establishes the alleged contraventions beyond reasonable doubt, and that the court does not need to be satisfied that there was intent to contravene in quasi-criminal cases such as a contempt case, and (4) the fourth element of causation is present in two forms. first, wasting the court’s time and making the court repeat the same order multiple times, and second, frustration and stress to him by spending time and writing repeatedly about the same need to disclose relevant information regarding the property proceedings.   the fourth element of causation is present in two forms. first, wasting the court’s time and making the court repeat the same order multiple times, and second, frustration and stress to him by spending time and writing repeatedly about the same need to disclose relevant information regarding the property proceedings.
the respondent’s position  a person shall be taken, for the purposes of this part, to have contravened if, and only if:   where a person who is bound by the order—he or she has:  intentionally failed to comply with the order, or (ii) made no reasonable attempt to comply with the order, or .]
... this court has consistently declined to make a finding of a flagrant challenge in cases involving what i would describe as a mere or run-of-the-mill type of contravention that would, otherwise, be dealt with by the contravention provisions of the act.
some orders say that the order dated x, the time to comply at paragraph (a) of order (x) is extended. i think the inference can be drawn there.
i would say that there simply isn’t evidence that could support a finding to the requisite standard that the respondent has intentionally failed to comply in relation to these disclosure orders, or made no reasonable attempt to comply with the order. and we say that each relevant document was eventually produced, and the production of those relevant documents was – demonstrates that any alleged failure to comply was not intentional, and it was just – it just took time. and, in any event, none of the charges can be – have been proved beyond a reasonable doubt.
