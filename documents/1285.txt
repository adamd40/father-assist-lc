meaningful relationship
...that desirability only operates where there is a chance of a meaningful relationship which is beneficial to the child. it is not, in other words, a question of contact for contact’s sake. if there is a situation where contact with a parent is on balance likely to cause more harm to the child than good, or even is not likely to confer any benefit, then little purpose is served by this court making orders for such contact. that does not detract from the desirability for the child to have a meaningful relationship, but the possibility of a meaningful relationship must first exist.
risk issues
additional considerations
any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give those views
the nature of the child’s relationships with each of his parents and other persons including grandparents or other relatives
the extent to which the child’s parents have taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in long-term decision making in relation to the child and to spend time and communicate with him
the extent to which each of the child’s parents have fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the child
the likely effect of a change in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect of a separation from a parent or other person including grandparent with whom they have been living
the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other significant persons to provide for their needs, including their emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant
the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which it was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, and any findings made by the court in proceedings for the order and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to further proceedings
any other fact or circumstance the court thinks is relevant
x’s knowledge of his identity
parental responsibility
time and communication with father
plainly it is a serious matter to order that a child neither spend time with nor communicate with a parent. such orders properly ought be restricted to cases where that outcome is plainly mandated in the best interests of the child, and no other regime of orders is appropriate or workable. such orders are commonly employed where the court is satisfied that a parent poses an unacceptable risk of harm to a child, which cannot be ameliorated by supervision of time and communication between that parent and the child. ...
unacceptable risk
thus, the essential importance of the unacceptable risk question as i see it is in its direction to judges to give real and substantial consideration to the facts of the case, and to decide whether or not, and why or why not, those facts could be said to raise an unacceptable risk of harm to the child. thus, the value of the expression is not in a magical provision of an appropriate standard, but in its direction to judges to consider deeply where the facts of a particular case fall, and explain adequately their findings in this regard.   what harmful outcome is potentially present in this situation? (2) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (3) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (4) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (5) what measures are available whose deployment could mitigate the risks that are probable?   what is the probability of this outcome coming about?

46. ... in cross-examination, the single expert discussed the deleterious psychological consequences for children of their exposure to family violence, which evidence was hardly a revelation. this court has long-recognised its destructive effect on the immediate victim and those who are exposed to the violence including, most relevantly in this case, the child (blanch v blanch and crawford [1998] famca 1908, (1999) flc 92-837 at 85,745-85,748, b & k [2001] famca 880 at [32], b & b [2003] famca 274 at [32]- [36], amador v amador [2009] famcafc 196, (2009) 43 fam lr 268 at [95], khalil & tahir-ahmadi [2012] famcafc 68, (2012) flc 93-506 at [189]).
