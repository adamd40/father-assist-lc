the court notes that:
reasons for judgment
judge turnbull
overview
facts and chronology
evidence
standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
parenting orders: the law
children’s best interests: the s 60cc factors
section 60cc(2)(a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents
what these definitions convey is that "meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[24]
it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[25]
section 60cc(2)(b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
on 05/12/2023, [ms spring] wrote: to: [mr spring] (first viewed: 05/12/2023) subject: handover 04/12/23 hi [mr spring], re: handover for [x] and [y] 04/12/23 (following 7 nights with me at [k street, suburb l]), health and wellbeing: [y] became snotty and a little feverish wednesday evening. needed some nurofen thurs and fri, better over the weekend, still a tad snotty but no temp or complaints so went off to school today. [x] having lots of trouble with faecal incontinence, had an accident between one and four occasions per day, mostly just the once. poor little man had a big accident at the party. i've been taking wipes and a change of clothes everywhere. he is very embarrased understandably and only wants my assistance to clean him up. [x] went to the dentist and [mr m] reported the following: avoid water cordial at all costs and only have milo before teeth brushing avoid excess lolly drinks, lollies and sweet biscuits - he has an impacted molar - very likely to need braces, will readdress this at 9 or 10 years of age, maybe sooner - two front teeth almost out, needs help to brush them carefully. two nights with the boys in my bed, one night each. eating well. behavioural: a little less swearing from [y] this week which was nice. both boys getting tired towards the end of the year. very excited about the elves and christmas/santa coming. great playing with all of their [n] cousins both saturday and sunday. [x] upset during [games] after he lost yet another game!! school: exciting day for [x] tomorrow. [ms o] will likely have been in touch to inform you he needs to wear his full formal summer uniform. extracurricular: no [sports] for [y]. great play therapy sessions. [mr p] very firm with them at [sports] and basically disappointed that they are mucking around a lot. he was great with them. i am still hoping you might find [x]'s newly made [toy]. he thinks he may be under his bed. please also return his plain clothes shorts from two weeks ago- the next ones, plus his pe polo, it didn't come back last week- think we got a new size 6 instead which i'm happy to return if we can grab the 8 please. i'll chat to them wednesday, i hope they have a lovely week. kind regards, [ms spring] sent: 27/11/2023 from: [mr spring] to: [ms spring] (first viewed: 27/11/2023) subject: re: handover 20/11/2023 boys have had a great week! good week at school, [x] loved the [sports] he was knackered most days. said he fell asleep on the bus one day and was lying on the couch at school when i got there friday afternoon. he wasn't sick, he still wanted to go and get [a] present then he came home and played in the water for a couple of hours.

section 60cc(3)(a): any views expressed by the child, and the weight to be accorded to those views given their age and level of maturity
the terms of s 60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child’s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child’s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child’s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court to these matters.[30]
section 60cc(3)(b): the nature of the relationship of the child with each of their parents  and [y] are delightful children, who have the benefit of two caring attentive parents and access to high quality education, activities, and therapy...[33]
.... ultimately the effects of this parental dispute and the boys disjointed experiences in their early years are unlikely to be fully evident until the boys are older, and they will need strong connected relationships with both parents to assist them through any challenges arise. such relationships will be built through quality time with each parent, rather than the quantity of time spend in each parent’s care.[35]
where the kids have attachment issues – developmentally misaligned arrangements – they can act out physically, have difficult friendships, have problems paying attention, lower self-esteem, and a loss of sense of who they are - not seeing a parent along time leads confusion and a feeling of abandonment which leads to trust issues - they might feel that a parent has disappeared and become less trusting that the parents are consistent are going to be there.[36]
section 60cc(3)(c): the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child
section 60cc(3)(ca): the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child
section 60cc(3)(d): the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect to the child from any separation from either of their parents
... children benefit more from equal time arrangements when they have developed the capacity to cognitively understand the transitions, when they have begun to emotionally regulate and are beginning to experience a level of emotional and physical independence. children who are not developmentally ready for such an arrangement may become overburdened and become so preoccupied by managing their transitions that they are unable to complete basic developmental tasks. also indicated within the cir, they are likely to experience less security and as such be at risk of persistent feelings of insecurity that will undermine their emotional and social development.[40]
... [y] is transitioning to prep and that’s quite taxing and he needs to be out of the house 5 days per week all day - learning a lot of rules - so i wouldn’t want it to increase to the end of 2024 – then 6/8 and then a year later or 6 months later go to equal time maybe after his birthday or the end of year – 2025.[42]   is young - i think full time school is really difficult - a lot of changes and relationships you have to maintain - so i think that it needs to be pushed out to full time school - so look at 18 months - so look at start of term 3 in 2025 and then add the next additional day after the 6th birthday in 2026 - after the 6 nights has consolidated.[43]
section 60cc(3)(e): the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time and communicating with a parent
section 60cc(3)(f): the capacity of each of the child’s parents to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
i. liaising with his [sports] coach to ensure his abilities are in line with lesson structures to build his self-confidence and improve his gross motor skills, ii. regular facilitation of participation in his physiotherapy prescribed home exercise program, and iii. participation in his classroom 'word of the week' sharing opportunities to provide the necessary scaffolding for intrapersonal and interpersonal growth and development. [mr spring] has never assisted [x] with these sharing opportunities, instead reporting he lets him 'be a kid'.
.... i consider denying [x] and [y] of the readily available supports in our community and not wanting them 'to be labelled' is a form of emotional and psychological neglect. although [mr spring] will physically assist in having the children at a physical location at a set time, he has never initiated an activity or opportunity directly related to the observations he makes. i have initiated the following as a result of my observations of the children's needs:
i. play therapy with [ms q] fortnightly for both boys, ii. assessment of [x]’s gross motor delays with a paediatric physiotherapist, iii. [sports] lessons weekly for both boys, iv. [music] lessons weekly and classroom sharing fortnightly for [x], v. the [r program] for [x] to address his bed wetting, vi. the 123 magic program to address [y]’s emotional !ability and aggression, vii. the circle of security program at [s centre] to further understand the children's needs, viii. 1:1 sessions with play therapist [ms q], psychologist [ms t], [u company] counsellor [ms v], and private counsellor [ms w] for coparenting guidance and addressing family violence impacts. ix. liaison with gp regarding [x]'s toileting regression and vomiting, with referral to a paediatrician, x. purchase and implementation of the our family wizard app for improved coparenting and communication. plus the weekly handover via this same communication platform.[47]
section 60cc(3)(g): the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background of the child and each of the child’s parents
section 60cc(3)(h)): if the child is aboriginal or torres strait islander
section 60cc(3)(i): the attitude to the child and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the parents
section 60cc(3)(j): any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family
section 60cc(3)(k): if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter
section 60cc(3)(l): whether it would be preferable to make orders that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
section 60cc(3)(m): any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
parental responsibility
presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
the presumption — legal principles and operation  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
...   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   family violence.   the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
equal time or substantial and significant time?  how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[61]   the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[61]   the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[61]   the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[61]   such other matters as the court considers relevant.[61]
consideration — equal or substantial and significant time?
optimal conditions for an equal time arrangement are broadly seen to include that parents can co-operate and support children’s relationships with each other across households.[63]
