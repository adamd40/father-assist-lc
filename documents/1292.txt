introduction
background
the father’s submissions  explained that when her parents first separated, she and her brother had moved into refuge accommodation with their mother and had not been able to communicate or spend time with their father or any other paternal relatives. [x] said that this had been “a very hard time” for both her and [y]. [x] said, “she took us away from our schools, our home and we couldn’t talk to dad for like 2 months and then only under supervision.” [x] said that visiting her father at the contact centre had not been a good experience.
i just want to live with dad for the moment, it is a good environment and he is supportive of us and helps us with our homework and takes us to sports. when we are with mum it doesn’t feel like a family. we just stay in our separate rooms and we don’t talk much.
hi last night mum was really telling us off and distracting us when we were talking to you – idk why she is like that and even said she wouldn’t give me dinner. i wish she would just leave us alone and let us talk to u in the barely any time we get hi
we are so bored – [y] just plays computer games all day, mum doenst care about what we are doing these holidays and is leaving us home alone all week and most of rest of holidays – christmas will be awful. we are scared of mum calling the police against us again as she has threatened but we thinking of run away today again and keep doing cos we don’t know what else to do.
staff member: it’s very messy because he’s a toxic abuser so do you know the worst type of narcissistic abusers are the ones that are lawyers, doctors, police officers or people like in my field because they know the system and they know the knowledge and the on the outside are so charming because i’m a doctor. caller: yeah staff member: they abuse their power so you’ve got probably one of the worst combinations and i’m so sorry to say this to you but i need you to hear me. caller: for my future, your honest advice would be the best thing would be to leave? staff member: okay, i’m not going to lie to you. this is what i’m going to say. ... staff member: intimate partner violence. you’ll go, oh my god, that’s me. so it’s 100 percent family violence. it’s very extreme and i think what you’re dealing with is one of the more dangerous presentations because i think he can go into very extreme physical violence if needed. caller: he’s much bigger than me. he’s much, much bigger than me staff member: he’s got so much – you’re probably one of the worst cases in the narcissistic abuse. if yours is pretty bad because you work together, you live together, he’s got cameras – i think he’s got cameras and apps stalking you so much more than you even know.

the mother’s submissions
‘risk assessment involves the identification of risk factors and an estimation of the likelihood and nature of a negative outcome, while risk management puts in place strategies to prevent these negative outcomes from occurring or to minimise their impact. qualitative risk analysis is the process of rating or scoring risk based on an assessor’s perception of the severity and likelihood of its consequences. quantitative risk analysis is the process of calculating risk based on data gathered. family violence screening tools do not provide a definitive measure of risk. risk factors may change over time and further assessment will need to be undertaken, should new information be presented. risk assessment is thus not a precise art and it is considered best practice to err on the side of caution when discussing how best to protect children and vulnerable adults.’[38]
‘the classification of family violence that seems to fit best, given the history of the relationship, is that of coercive controlling violence which is an ongoing pattern of use of threat, force, emotional abuse, and other coercive means to unilaterally dominate a person and induce fear, submission, and compliance in them. its focus is on control and does not always involve physical harm. according to the screening tool, the primary perpetrator of the abuse in this matter is identified as the father. [note: the report writer again acknowledges that the allegations are yet to be tested in both the criminal and family law proceedings.]’[39]
‘in this matter, where the stakes are extremely high and the conflict has polarised the extended families, it would be unwise to discount the outcome of the risk assessment. the mother and children are assessed as being at significant risk of harm, particularly if the criminal proceedings should result in a negative outcome for the father.’[40]
the independent children’s lawyers (‘the icl’) submissions
the law
as has frequently been emphasised interim parenting proceedings, and orders made as a consequence, are a necessary but temporary measure until all the evidence can be tested, evaluated and weighed at a final hearing by the making of final parenting orders. decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires, or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing (s 61db).[41]
in our view, findings made at an interim hearing should be couched with great circumspection, no matter how firmly a judge’s intuition may suggest that the finding will be borne out after a full testing of the evidence.[42]
the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.[43]
as would be immediately apparent, this approach enables the court to appropriately and carefully deal with contentious issues relevant to the welfare of the child, and for those issues to not be ignored.[44]
unacceptable risk
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[52]
the children’s best interests: the s 60cc factors
section 60cc(2)(a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents
what these definitions convey is that "meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[55]
it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[56]
section 60cc(2)(b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
‘the court child expert has significant concerns regarding the emotional wellbeing of both of the children due to their exposure to parental conflict and potential family violence. exposure to conflict and family violence can have serious implications on the mental health of children and young people and it seems that the children have already suffered due to separation and various changes in their lives. it is of further concern that the children’s attitudes and behaviour towards their mother seems to have significantly changed recently and [ms veda] feels that she has no authority in the home. the change in the children’s behaviour could be due to a number of factors including their resentment for the changes that they have experienced. however, it needs to also be considered that there is a possibility that this is the result of the children’s exposure to family violence and there is a potential that they are mimicking behaviours towards their mother that they have been exposed to.’[60]
the ppp risk assessment raised a significant number of red flags, indicating that a lethality assessment was warranted. this finding was commensurate with the dvsat tool completed [in early] 2023, identifying 17 high risk dfv indicators. the checklist was utilised by the report writer to identify lethality indicators, with information obtained from the parents during the interviews. information provided by the father did not raise concerns in regard to lethality, however, information provided by the mother scored a possible 25 out of 39, indicating a very high risk of lethality, falling into the ‘serious threat’ category.[61]
the single expert would not recommend or support a change of residency to the father at this point in the proceedings for the following reasons: while the evidence is yet to be tested, risk assessments undertaken by a variety of professionals over an extended period of time have identified the father as posing a significant risk of harm to the children and to their mother. information provided by the mother during the current assessment scored a possible 25 out of 39 on the checklist, indicating a very high risk of lethality. falling into the ‘serious threat’ category. there is a small window of opportunity to repair and restore the relationship between [x] and her mother, however, this is unlikely to occur if the child remains living with the father, given the issues identified in the single expert report. at this point in time, they still have a loving relationship, however, there is a good chance that the mother-daughter relationship will fracture if the current situation is allowed to continue. [x] would then become estranged from both her mother and her extended maternal family. this would come at a significant cost to the child’s emotional and psychological well-being and to her future development. the relationship between [y] and his mother is likely to deteriorate should primary care be awarded to the father on an interim basis, given the issues identified in the single expert report. it is predicted that this will come at a significant cost to the child’s emotional and psychological well-being, at a time when [y] is already struggling.[62]

section 60cc(3)(a): any views expressed by the child, and the weight to be accorded to those views given their age and level of maturity
the terms of s 60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child’s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child’s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child’s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court to these matters.[65]
in situations where a parent is assessed as posing a significant risk of harm (emotional, psychological or physical harm) to a child, then steps should be taken to address that risk, even in cases where a child may articulate a preference to live with the abusive parent. this is not something that the court takes lightly and it will be important to balance the child’s wishes with the need to protect the child from harm.[66]
... there is significant concern that the children have knowledge of court dispute and are denigrating their mother and using terms that are not indicative of their age and stage of development. if the children are in fact exposed to inappropriate conversations during their time with their father, it may be more appropriate for time to be supervised by a professional agency. however, it also is considered that the children would experience emotional distress if their time with their father was decreased or altered significantly, given their expressed close relationships with him.[67]
at 13 years of age, [x] is ill-equipped to make major decisions that will have last lasting consequences for her, including in regard to her relationships with her parents. although her father and grandmother were quick to describe her as ‘very mature’, this is best explained as pseudo-maturity. this is a term used to describe children who act more mature than they are in order to gain peer approval or to cope with family problems. this may interfere with the development of real maturity, especially in cases where abuse is present or when children take over adult roles, leading them to experience role confusion.[68]
whilst [x] has expressed clear views in regards to her father, there is concern that the narrative she provided was very similar to the narrative that [mr harendra] and [ms d] provided, and [x] recalled the same incidents as her father. it is acknowledged that [x] likely does have a close relationship with her father however she seemed very aligned to him and keen to dispute allegations against him, that she really should have no knowledge of... the significant changes that the children have experienced may be leading them to view [mr harendra] as the preferred parent given that he can provide them with the lifestyle that they are longing for.[69]
it seems that the power imbalance needs to be considered between the parents when taking into consideration the views of the children as it is noted that the children are longing to live in their family home and go back to their previous lifestyle, which is understandable as these things are important to them at their young ages.[70]
the children are currently in a very difficult position, having aligned themselves with the father, to the point that they now risk becoming estranged from the mother. at this point in time, neither child is well-equipped to make considered decisions regarding the parenting arrangements and it is suggested that this should be taken into account when deciding how much weight should be accorded to their views.[71]
section 60cc(3)(b): the nature of the relationship of the child with each of their parents
section 60cc(3)(d): the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect to the child from any separation from either of their parents
it seems that both [y] and [x] have struggled significantly with the various changes in their lives since the time of separation. both of the children have had to move out of the family home and have had significant changes to their lifestyle, which seems to have been a significant disruption and has had an impact on their emotional wellbeing. furthermore, the children have been exposed to police involvement, which has likely exacerbated their emotional distress.[72]
given the risks raised in this matter, it seems that caution should be taken in changing the arrangement to unsupervised time until the level of risk to the children could be ascertained.[73]
section 60cc(3)(f): the capacity of each of the child’s parents to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
section 60cc(3)(i): the attitude to the child and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the parents
section 60cc(3)(j): any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family
section 60cc(3)(k): if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter.
section 60cc(3)(l): whether it would be preferable to make orders that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
section 60cc(3)(m): any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.
