dr m - paediatrician  is a 5 y.o boy who has significant behavioural and emotional problems following exposure to domestic violence at father's place ... he has problems with anger management which usually leading to physical aggression towards himself and other people at home and at kindy. there is lots of swearing from him as well. i have seen him already and he has not got any features of asd, adhd or other developmental problems. i believed his behaviours is related to the trauma from exposure to domestic violence, copying inappropriate adult behaviours. (as per the original)
camhs
his [father] used to hit him (nil details where he was hit/how hard) his [father] used to yell at him his [father] would go to bed at night and leave him alone in the dark to put himself to bed [x] spoke of being in the car with [father] driving really fast and was not listening if [x] asked him to slow down. [x] felt really scared [x] has spoken often of feeling scared when in his [father’s] care.
ms n - provisional psychologist  presents with a high number of mental health problems and behaviours of concern which are consistent with exposure to a significant about of early trauma. [x]'s posttraumatic stress symptoms relating to arousal are clinically significant and in the 99th percentile for his age group, indicating that it is likely that his neurodevelopment has been affected. [x] has extremely high levels of anxiety compared to other children of the same age and has difficulty regulating his emotions. from the information provided regarding [the father’s] behaviour and [x]'s reactions the relevant literature suggest that contact with [the father] at this stage is likely to be detrimental to [x]'s mental wellbeing and may hinder progress of him healing from his past trauma. re-traumatision is highly likely to occur with longer term risk for mental health and behavioural problems increasing.
the courts approach at interim hearings
28 july 2022 [x] was engaged in play whilst [the grandmother], clinician and [x] all spoke to share stories. [the grandmother] introduced the idea that [x] has witnessed scary things by his [father], [x] then willingly shared that [father] has hit him, yelled at him, would go to bed and leave [x] in the dark to put himself to sleep. [x] commented that he never wanted to go to the father’s house, and the clinician aided the development of a narrative. [the grandmother] had a tendency to provide lots of information regarding the timeline of events with the clinician attempting to slow [the grandmother] down to come back and refocus on [x]'s experience of events she had raised. [x] played throughout and offered his comments or thoughts, experiences to the story. 20 october 2022 [x] engaged in craft activities with the clinician while [the grandmother] and clinician spoke to continue [x]'s story with a focus today, on the storyline of how [x] may have been feeling around the time the visits to his father stopped. [x] did not offer much in this discussion.   then asked the cce “do you know my dad”. [x]'s question appeared to be from a place of curiosity and wanting to gather information as he told the cce it had been a long time since he had seen him. [x] could remember going to his father’s home, and he reported that it was “boring he was on the phone” and that at times he “yelled at me” and “he got angry.” when this is further explored, [x] told the cce he did not want to talk about it anymore. when asked if he wanted to see his father [x] responded, “yes, i would like to see him again.” he stated it made him feel “sad” that he is not seeing him anymore. [x] was not aware of the reason why he does not see his father anymore.
children exposed to family violence can display emotionally dysregulated behaviour, angry outbursts, regression in their behaviour and be vulnerable to mental health issues in the future. it is possible, that [x]'s past and/or current behaviour, particularly in relation to his emotional dysregulation, may in part be related to exposure to alleged family violence in the formative years of his development. it is also possible that [x]'s past or current behaviour is a result of the conflict between the parties, the abrupt nature of his time spending ending with his father and/or his reported sadness and confusion about not spending time with his father.
...attributed all of [x]'s psychological, cognitive and emotional difficulties to his experiences in his father’s care and their narrative was fixed and rigid around the only way to protect the child was to deny this relationship in its entirety.
...he was told by his mum, “daddy was mean to all of us.” ... [x] then looked down as he told the writer his grandparents talk about his father sometimes say his “daddy is rude.” [x] was clearly upset by the thought of his father being characterised in this manner and appeared to be questioning the validity of these opinions in the context of his own views.
children grow, develop and thrive best when they have access to both parents if this is a physically and psychologically safe environment. parents provide them with the building blocks from which they build their identity, sense of self and belonging. when not provided with these fundamental foundations children are at risk of their own mental health issues. they can blame themselves for the fractured relationship and experience a sense of loss that they attribute to their own behaviour all resulting in the possibility of childhood trauma. [x]’s interview would suggest he has not been given a narrative regarding his extended absence from his father’s and siblings life and this may lead him to question his own behaviour and cause feelings of abandonment as he internalises the reasons. these all have significant consequences on a young child’s emotional development and may impact his relationships as an adult in the future.
additional considerations
any views expressed by the child   told the cce again he was not sure about why he did not see his father anymore, expressing “i don’t know my dad” and giving a sense of missing that relationship stating he wished to see him “a lot more”. while he described living with his grandparents as “not that good but ok” and seemed somewhat resigned to this arrangement, he then went on to say, “i kinda want a dad”. he would like his father to “be nice to me and show that he loves me”.
the nature of the relationship of the child with parents/others  identified his mum ([ms barrow]) and grandma as the most important people in his life and he said he talks to them about things that upset him.
when [x] was interviewed, he spoke about his young sister [f] with a sense of responsibility and fondness, while it is not known whether the sense of responsibility comes from a place of wanting to protect her or a feeling of having abandoned her it was noted to have caused a sense of loss for him. sibling relationships are some of the most strong and enduring a child can have, they are life long and unconditional, it would be important that [x] is not denied from experiencing this relationship.
