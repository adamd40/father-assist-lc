at about [2.00am] the poi was witnessed by attending police to be street fighting with another poi. the poi was throwing punches toward the other poi and when spoken to he said “he touched my girlfriend.” the poi stated he had about 5 standard drinks at [a bar]... small cut on head... ambos delivered... in company of girlfriend and another male.[2]
as a result of their broken-down relationship, there is constant verbal arguments which occur on a regular basis. whether it be in personal, or via text message. sometime during [early] 2019, the vic and poi engaged in a conversation via text message. the vic said, “you need help”. the poi replied, "i'm going to kill you". the vic said, "good". the poi said, "come here now and i'll show you". the vic said, “pft i'm going to sleep'. the poi replied, "yea pussy ... i fucking hate you". it is also at an unknown time the poi has stated to the poi, "i'm not happy i want to die". the vic replied, "kill yourself then". the poi at some stage has made reference to her relationship with her child saying to the vic, "i don't want to do this anymore ok .... u can have him ... idc [i don't care] just take him ... i don't want to be a mum ... he is never pleasant ... fucking sick of this shit". at about 5.30am [in early] 2018, the poi dropped her child to the vic at [redacted]. after about 30 minutes, the poi received a message from the vic stating she would not get her child back. the poi left work in [suburb j] returning to the poi's location. the poi began banging on the door, "give my fucking child back". the poi kicked the bottom of the door causing footprints to the door however nil damage. due to the child beginning to cry, the vic took the child out the back, placing him into a vehicle before leaving the location to avoid confrontation. the vic contacted facs and they advised that this was a good thing to have done for the child. ... police believe that the most appropriate action is to apply for a provisional apprehended violence order to protect the vic. that mandatory conditions only and an exclusion order be applied for. poi and vic will still be able to exchange child, however not at the vic's loc enabling vic protection and child to be safe.[4]   late] 2020, i was rostered on day shift in full police uniform attached to [region l] metropolitan operations support group. about 1pm i attended [m venue] in relation to a planned unlawful protest. when i attended i was given a briefing in relation our response as police. during that briefing i was given the role as a section leader as part of one of the police support units. about 2pm we attended [n venue] which is located within [m venue] where there was a large crowd gathering. during the large crowd gathering a move on direction was given by the forward commander [...]. once the move on direction was given a member of my section moved in and peacefully removed protesters from the crowd. i then saw [a senior officer] approach a male who i know as the accused [mr asterios]. whilst [the officer] was having a conversation with the accused. i saw the accused pull out his licence and refused to give the licence to [the officer]. at this point a struggle has occurred and the accused was arrested. during the arrest i have grabbed the accused and assisted in taking him to the ground. whilst on the ground the accused was resisting by refusing to put his hands behind his back. with assistance from other police the accused was handcuffed to the rear. once the accused was handcuffed, he was then escorted to the command post where his details were obtained and was issued with a notice.[5]
about [11:00am] [in early] 2021 the accused attended [suburb r] police to report a minor motor vehicle accident. [redacted] approached the accused and began to have a conversation with him about the accident. the accused explained to [redacted] that details had been exchanged however the other driver displayed an [overseas] licence. the accused didn't think this was appropriate and began to argue, speak over and yell at [redacted]. due to the accused intimidating behaviour, [redacted] has walked away and left the room. the accused continued to yell, demand police attention and demand that police speak with him and take his report. the accused was stating words to the effect of "come arrest me, what do i have to do to get arrested". as police were asking him to stop yelling and calm down, the accused has then punched the perspex safety screen at the front counter. when this occurred another member of the public within the foyer of the police station stepped back from the accused and sat on the only available seat. the irate, yelling and intimidating behaviour and punching the safety glass, this brought the attention of [the] chief inspector [...]. c/insp [...] approached the accused and offered his assistance, the accused was still irate, continuously yelling and demanding police to take a report. c/insp [...] tried to get the accused to calm down in order to take a report from the accused however the accused became irate demanding "arrest me then, arrest me". due to the behaviour of the accused, c/insp [...] told the accused to go outside for 5 minutes and start again. the accused did not comply and instead refused stating "no i'm not leaving until someone takes my report and gives me an event number". c/insp [...] continued asked the accused to leave [suburb r] police station, the accused declined stating that he would call the police assistance line. c/incp [...] said to the accused "call the police assistance line, but you can go out and do it." the accused again refused and at this time [a senior officer], c/insp [...] and multiple other police exited the front counter to the foyer area. at this time one of the two members of public within the foyer left out the doors. the accused was directed to leave by [the senior officer] who then attempted to escort him out. at this time the accused threw his hands in the air and began yelling "don't touch me." simultaneously c/insp [...] has placed the accused under arrest and a struggle has ensued. the accused held his hands to his front of his body refusing to place his hands behind his back. police forcefully put the accused hands to the rear and handcuffed him to prevent further violent and quarrelsome behaviour. the accused continued to struggle, yelling and attempting to antagonise c/insp [...]. the accused was walked to the left of the foyer and continued to talk with c/insp [...]. c/insp [...] began to walk away, and the accused took one step towards him. the accused was pulled back by [the senior officer] and placed against a wall. he attempted to pull away from [the senior officer]. police attempted to have the accused sit on the ground by directing him down. while doing so he kicked at [the senior officer] with his right leg and then again with his left. the first kick by the accused connected with the pants of [the senior officer] and touched the front of the shin as she pulled her leg away. multiple police approached the accused placing him in the recovery position to gain control of his violent kicking and prevent any further assaults. as police placed the accused in the recovery position, he has grabbed [another officer’s] hand. the accused was told to let go of the [officer’s] hands. multiple times and [the senior officer] has slapped the wrist of the accused in an effort to have the accused release his grip. as she done so the accused has released his grip of [the officer]. the accused was held until eventually calmed down and he was sat up against the wall. the accused was conveyed to [suburb j] police station..... the accused was still argumentative towards police..... given the level of aggression the accused was still displaying, a [senior officer] independent to the investigation was also present during the interview to prevent any further outbursts. during the interview the accused agreed that he failed to listen to police after being asked to leave on multiple occasions and stated that he was never going to leave the police station. all allegations were put to the accused which he denied.[6]
the accused attended the residence of the victims in aim to evict them as the house is under his name and he wishes to rent it out... the accused and victims started having a heated argument where the accused has grabbed his phone and stood up close to victim 1 and has placed his phone camera near victims 1’s face where victim 1 has pushed the phone away from her face. at that point, the accused has grabbed victim 1’s neck and has used his other hand to punch victim 1 on her face which caused pain to her left cheek area. victim 2 has then attempted to intervene and separate the accused from victim 1, when the accused has gone into a shuffle with both victims attempting to push and punch them both. the accused got a hold of victim 1’s hair, has pushed her to the ground and dragged her across the living room floor where she has hit her knee [on a table] causing her [an injury]. victim 2 has then intervened again and the accused has pushed victim 2 to the ground where he has also hurt himself which has given him red marks and caused him pain.[7]
i said “who has been assaulted?” [ms w] said “myself and my father” pointing at [mr q] who nodded. i observed injuries – red marks on [mr q’s body]. i said “what are these injuries from?” [ms w] said “they are from my brother it all happened during the fight and he injured my father too.” i said “[mr q] do you have any injuries?” [mr q] said “yes” and showed me [the body] area where i observed red marks. i then used a camera and took photographs of that area.[8]
the accused was followed by police onto [t street] were he was directed to stop for the purpose of random testing for alcohol and drug in his system while operating a motor vehicle. this was done activating the warning red and blue lights attached to the police vehicle and wailing the police siren. the accused did not move to the left and pull over as required, he continued for a short distance in the right lane. the accused stopped in the right lane in the flow of traffic. he exited his car and became abusive towards police swearing about a place to stop. the accused got back in his car and was directed by police to stop and not move. his intentions to drive and not comply with the direction to stop was clear. seeing this [an officer] has attempted to remove the keys from the ignition. as he reached into the vehicle to take the keys the accused has lashed out with his right arm, assaulting him by making contact with [his] arm and torso of [the officer]. due to the assault [the officer] suffered soreness to his arm. after being assaulted [the officer] tried again to remove the keys by reaching into the vehicle, as he was doing this the accused accelerated away from police for a short distance before stationary traffic at a red light has effectively blocked him from proceeding any further. police have again approached the vehicle and told the accused to stop and get out of the car. the accused wound down his window approximately 5cm and refused police directions again. a short burst of oc spray was delivered to the accused at this point before the accused has driven away from police again. the traffic was now flowing due to a green phasing, the accused drove along [t street] and turned right into [u street], police following with lights and sirens still indicating for him to stop. the accused has came to a stop on [u street], reversed alongside the police vehicle and stopped. police approached the drivers side and told the accused to get out. the accused has forcefully opened the drivers side door on the front near side panel of the police car and was immediately aggressive towards police. the action of opening the door onto the police vehicle caused the front guard above the wheel arch to become dislodged and a small scratch in the paint. he stood up between the open door and the body of the car and continued to be aggressive. he was informed he was under arrest and instructed to place his hands out in order to be handcuffed. each of the accused's hands were taken hold of by police, he tensed and pulled his hands away from police, using force to counter police efforts to arrest him. the accused has broken free and got back in his vehicle. police used a baton [...] in order to effect the arrest. the accused attempted to move to the passenger side of the vehicle, police had hold of the accused's belt stopping him from getting to the other side of the vehicle. police on the passenger side of the vehicle broke the [...] glass in order to access the vehicle and arrest the accused. once access was gained the accused was placed in handcuffs and removed from the vehicle. the accused was conveyed to [suburb v] police station, introduced to the custody manager and entered into custody. whilst in custody the accused has requested medical assistance, was attended to by ambulance officers and was conveyed to [z hospital]. before the accused was transported it was explained to him police had intention to breath and drug test him however he was conveyed without testing being done. while at the hospital the accused was informed of his requirement to provide blood to be tested for alcohol as he was unable to submit to a breath analysis. he refused this requirement. the accused was discharged from hospital, returned to custody, and is now before the court.[12]  he june 2022 interim orders”).

the family report
the legal principles  ] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) – something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act – the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent.
the parties’ current circumstances
the primary considerations
meaningful relationship
...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests. [20]
risk of harm
the father’s criminal antecedence
the mother’s allegations as to family violence
father: u angry at me cos i told her to shut up? i didnt mean it mother: it’s ok u just need to relax a bit sometimes. i knew she wasn’t crying for no reason but next time u will know father: yeh i’m sorry i didnt mean to snap at her just really thought my hand was covering her.[21]
mother: and i would like it if u stop talking about me to [ms d]. u said some nasty things which i believe i don’t deserve. father: too late for that...ur lucky i’m not giving her ur address...i hate that u always run to spread shit mother: don’t threaten me....[22]
hard to ignore her...really presses my buttons...ill try control myself but i can feel it inside me that i want to hurt her i just want her dead ill just get [e] and then ill block and ignore her really feel sorry for him she should never have become a mother.[23]
would u want to run away with me if i took [e]? like i mean ill literally save up and quit my job take [e] and get a place away from everything claim child support and live off it.[24]
now i am not allowed to see him anymore [ms asterios] im about to go to jail i wana beat the shit out of her.[25]
u got plans tomorrow during the day? no..plans ok i wont be high either lol ok lol.[26]
the father’s allegations
the additional considerations
my relationship with [x] is strong enough for her to remember who i am and for her to be comfortable with me. i noticed that from when the court first ordered for me to be reintroduced into their lives and when [x] saw me after some time, she still remembered me and said, “i know who you are, you’re my daddy.”
i can’t stand babysitting [e] i don’t know why but i can’t f’kn stand it.[28]
i don’t want to be [x]’s dad anymore, go and find her a new one.
frustration due to the two women i was alternating between, i was torn in trying to figure out how to go forward in the position i was in.   d]: can i ask why u were with [mr asterios] yesterday? i don’t care. u do the drop off amd fuk off... [mr asterios] is not ur man. we are together. dont message him unless it’s about [x] or you’ll have to start going through me. and if u don’t like that he can easily go through court again. we have a family now and are having another baby. your lonely pathetic ass has come in between my family too many times. fukn dirty slut. i’ve let it slide that u thought u could be around my son before, but if this happens again, you won’t like what follows.[29]
discussion and disposition
the children’s care arrangements
i reluctantly agree that supervised contact time is appropriate in the children’s long term interests, however i believe that adequate and appropriate safeguards need to be put into place, namely that the report writer’s recommendations are implemented (being the parenting orders courses, and drug testing) before supervised time can occur.
