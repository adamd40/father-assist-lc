the hearing
the legal principles
the children’s best interests - primary considerations  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
meaningful relationship
...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...
...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
protection from harm
...appears reluctant to acknowledge personal limitations and will tend to repress or deny distress or other internal consequences that might arise from such limitations. this tendency will lead him to minimise, or perhaps even be unaware of, problems or other areas where functioning might be less than optimal...these areas that could indicate problems that merit further enquiry are: impact of traumatic events, stress in the environment, failures in close relationships, suspiciousness, impaired empathy, and inflated self-esteem.[15]
asd is a developmental condition that affects the way individuals relate to their environment and interact with other people. [the father] appears to find understanding other people and the more complex aspects of social interaction challenging. he appears to find it hard to translate some of this knowledge into interactions with others, particularly when there is a need to mentalise...he, at times, appears to be self‑focussed as a result.

late 2018   late] 2018 i spent the day at [town ee] club for my dad’s birthday. i was with my 3 kids. [c], [d] and [x]. we got home about 3:30pm and [c] did not get out of the car. we had an argument in the car coming back up the hill. [c] was very tired from staying at his friends place and not going to bed until 3am. [mr cole] my partner come out and asked me what was wrong. i just shook my head. [mr cole] said. "get out of the car." [c] got out and went to walk between [mr cole] and i. [mr cole] asked [c] what was going on. [c] did not answer him and tried to walk away. [mr cole] grabbed his jumper and again asked him what was going on. [c] pulled away and [mr cole] let go. [c] walked out to the driveway and [mr cole] said, "fine then just go and don 't come back." [c] stayed near the road on the driveway. i sent [d] back inside the house. i spoke to [mr cole] about grabbing [c] but i don't remember the words. [c] then started walking up the street. [mr cole] walked back towards the house. i said, "great i don't really need this." i ran down after [c]. by this stage he was 2 houses away. i spoke to [c] and tried to get him to stop but [c] would just walk past me. i ran back to the house and got the car. when i was there i put [x] in the car. [mr cole] and i had a verbal argument in the driveway. i got in the car and drove down the road to [c]. i stopped and got out and spoke to [c] and asked him to get in the car and go home. he just refused and ran down the road further away from the house. i followed in the car. i parked ahead of him and pulled up. i waited for [c] to get to me. [c] said, "i want to go home." ... [mr cole] turned up in his car. he got out of the car as i let go of [c]. [c] went to walk out i grabbed him and gave him another hug. [mr cole] had walked over to us. [mr cole] said, "[d] told me that your cousin had coloured in your page and that's why your upset." [c] said, 'that's not why i'm upset." i said, "[c] is upset because i yelled at him.' [c] went to push away from me. [mr cole] grabbed [c]'s legs and lifted him. i still had hold of [c]'s top half. [c] grabbed onto the tree which is on the footpath to get away. [mr cole] tried to pull him off the tree. i asked [mr cole] why he had grabbed [c]'s legs because i nearly dropped him. [mr cole] put his legs back down and i let [c] go so he was standing. [c] turned to walk away. [mr cole] grabbed [c's] left arm and [c] tried to pull away and told him to let him go. [mr cole] started saying, “if you just told me what was going on we could have just worked it out” and [c] just kept trying to pull away. [mr cole] grabbed [c]'s left wrist with both hands. [c] was trying to pull away and he was crying. [c] told [mr cole] that he was hurting him and told [mr cole] to let him go. [mr cole] said, "i will stop when you stop pulling away." [mr cole] was pretty angry. [c] tried to pull away and was crying more. [mr cole]'s fingers were going white from holding so tight. i grabbed [mr cole]'s hands to try to get him to let go. i said, "let go your hurting him." i managed to get one of [mr cole]'s hand off [c] and [c] was trying to pull away and get away from him. i said, "you're hurting him let go." [mr cole] let go. [c] started running up the road. [mr cole] chased after him and pushed [c] to the back with an open hand causing [c] to fall to the ground. [c] landed on his front. [mr cole] then put his right knee in [c]'s back. [mr cole] then pushed [c]'s head into the ground. [c] face hit the grassy ground. [mr cole] then got out his phone and said, "i'm going to call the police.” it all happened so quickly and i ran over to [c] and told [mr cole] to get off him. [mr cole] then got off. [c] just lay on the grass. i sat next to [c] and hugged him as much as he would let me. [mr cole] then called the police. [c] and i sat talking waiting for the police. [mr cole] said to [c], "i hope your happy. the police will arrest me.” [mr cole] said he would wait in his car and walked back to his car. [mr cole] got into his car. [c] and i sat together for a while. [c] said that his back hurt. ... [mr cole] said, "i hope your happy. you got what you wanted. i'm going to be arrested. i'm going to go to prison. this is all your fault." i said to [c], "just stay quiet." the police turned up just as we were going back to the car to return home. i went to [town t] police to provide a statement. after the statement i had a good look at [c]'s arm, face and back and didn't see any injuries or red marks.[30]

discussion and disposition
parental responsibility
time with orders
i’m sure at the time of receiving those messages that would have been very upsetting and disturbing and if it was proven that it was the father sending them that would be concerning because my sense of the father is that he was perhaps more benign. if you’re saying there is an allegation of inappropriate messages being sent, that puts a different light on it. the mother lives quite a distance from the father who doesn’t have her address and i don’t think there have been any allegations of stalking or anything similar, so i would imagine that the mother probably has put those things behind her and is getting on with her life. i think as things stand at the moment it probably doesn’t impact on her parenting capacity.   cole] appeared to demonstrate a lack of insight into the impact of his offending behaviour, nor did he demonstrate any remorse for the victim.
