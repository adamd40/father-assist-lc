reasons for judgment
judge murdoch
introduction
evidence
background  the children will live with each parent in sydney, australia during school term periods as set out in the following paragraph. [6] the children will live with each parent in sydney, australia during school holiday periods as set out in the following paragraph.
my family and i will contribute what we can to their activists, [sic] schooling and care. all you need to do is say all payments we make are in lieu of child support pretty simple.”[5]
the father: “i spoke to my lawyer today. i am not legally obligated to pay anything outside of child support. any additional expenses you would like to add need to be submitted to the courts. that includes medical, daycare or co-curricular activities.”
father: please send me an email saying it’s in lieu of child support and i can buy it. mother: no. [x] misses out again. father: ok. mother: this is so terrible that you don’t care and it’s her first day of school father: almost as terrible as you spending money with lawyers to try and take them away from me... ask your parents for the money. it’s your responsibility as primary carer ... do not contact me again about money
no it’s your responsibility mother: ... i have no money! i tried but i don’t have any money. they need to eat [mr timms]. father: you’ll need to ask your parents ... if you need help paying things, send us the bill and an email saying it’s in lieu of child support... they have the best food and experiences with me. if you can’t provide for them, we will need to discuss with lawyers.[6]
the legal principles
the principles recognise the damage which may be caused to children by endless litigation which may, directly or indirectly, expose them to conflict, and the potential abuse of a child by subjecting the child to repeat expert interviews.
the full court has cautioned that: “as a generality, the interests of the parties and the court are better served by there being one final hearing of s79 proceedings.”[14]
discussion and determinaton
the summary application of the father
....paid 100% of day care and/or school fees for the children, paid all of the medical costs for the children, paid the majority of all the children’s extra-curricular activities (including [music] and [language] lessons), paid for all the children’s excursions, paid for all the children’s clothing and allowed her to keep $104,000 worth of furniture.[17]
the application to relocate   spontaneously expressed in a sad tone of voice that “i miss mummy when i’m with daddy, and i miss daddy when i’m with mummy.”[23]
if relocation occurred, it would be of utmost importance to maintain, as far as possible, the children's frequent contact with the father and other familiar family members. yet it is difficult to see how that would occur, apart from online communication.[27]
partial property settlement
interim spousal maintenance
i am satisfied, using the language of the high court in hall v hall [2016] hca 23, (2016) 257 clr 490 that the father is capable of “drawing” funds and a reasonable expectation that he will receive them. thus, in all the circumstances i broadly find that the father does have the capacity to contribute a lump sum and, on that being exhausted, periodic spousal maintenance to the mother.
