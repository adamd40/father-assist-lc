reasons for judgment(ex tempore reasons settled from transcript)
judge dickson:
introduction
background  6] the evidence adduced by the respondent is insufficient to allow a finding that there is an unacceptable level of risk that the applicant plans to murder her or have an agent do so on his behalf. there is insufficient evidence to establish that the applicant’s muslim and [country e] characteristics mean that he poses a greater risk of harm to the respondent then if he was a man of non-muslim and non-[country e] background. the focus needs to be more upon the particular individual concerned in a particular case, rather that the religion he practices or the part of the world in which he is born. [117] the evidence establishes that the applicant has committed acts of family violence against the respondent and the children and that they have been traumatised as a result thereof and remain traumatised. although the respondent honestly believes that the applicant intends to kill her, and it is true that the murder of a woman is often preceded by non-lethal acts of violence against her by her killer, it is difficult to see a basis for concluding that the applicant is more likely to intend murder than any of the many other family violence perpetrators who come before the courts exercising family law jurisdictions. [118] there is also insufficient evidence to establish that the applicant has any links to any [crime] organisation or that his service in [country e] many years ago, which involved him bearing arms, creates any additional risk that the respondent will be the subject of an “honour killing”. similarly, the evidence that the applicant views speeches on [social media] made by various [preachers] does not prove that he is radicalised or that he practices any extreme forms of islam. the applicant views these speeches as part of what he described as the usual practice of islam, in much the same way as, say, practicing christians will listen to sermons from priests or other religious leaders. ... [190] the single expert is clear that the children have been traumatised by the actions of the applicant and that they require and are receiving counselling to help them to heal. to abruptly re-introduce the applicant directly into the lives of the children would be to risk the children regressing to the psychological place from which they have departed. the single expert, quite properly, expressed reservations about the morality of any court simply “trialling” a set of arrangements for children in the hope that no further damage is done to them and their mother. ... [192] the respondent’s fears of the applicant are genuinely held. the evidence indicates that the impact upon the respondent of the making of orders of the type proposed by the applicant would be highly negative and likely to impact negatively on her capacity to meet all of the needs of the children, including their emotional needs. that outcome could not possibly serve to advance the best interests of the children.[3]
parenting orders are never final in the sense that some financial orders are final. if circumstances change, that is, if there is a genuine change in the mindset of the applicant, then it is open to the applicant to apply in the future for orders providing for the children to spend time with him. however, as the single expert points out at paragraph 156 of his report, unfortunately, the applicant is not a good candidate for change.[4]
a) insufficient evidence to persuade the court to make the commonwealth information order, and b) that the father needed to provide further evidence.
b) that the father needed to provide further evidence.
for the purpose of determining whether the location order should be made, the father read into evidence his affidavits filed on 1 march 2023 which annexes various documents outlining steps that he had taken to address the family violence finding made in 2019, and sought to re-establish a relationship with his children.
shortly prior to delivery of the judgment, the father had filed an application in proceeding on 20 june, seeking to reopen his case for a location order, based on events subsequent to the hearing. the father affirmed that, [in] 2023, he had received an international phone call from the mother’s siblings which alleged various things in relation to the mother’s health.
the seriousness of this information and the prospect of the children being at risk of harm from neglect warrants conducting the hearing of the application in the proceedings on the papers, due to there being urgency. in my view, i have determined in chambers on the papers that leave should be given to the father to reopen his case on the location order.

evaluation
court child experts are qualified psychologists or social workers who have specialist knowledge in child and family issues after separation and divorce. court child experts are employees of the federal circuit and family court of australia and work in an area of the court called the court children’s services. court child experts hold a statutory appointment as a family consultant and an authorisation as a family counsellor. these appointments and authorisations are issued by the court’s chief executive officer. under their family consultant appointment, court child experts conduct assessments and prepare reports that have been ordered by the court. under their family counsellor authorisation, court child experts undertake other duties including: a) providing advice about children in court, and b) conducting triage interviews as part of the court’s lighthouse project.
a) providing advice about children in court, and b) conducting triage interviews as part of the court’s lighthouse project.
b) conducting triage interviews as part of the court’s lighthouse project.
like so many matters in this court, it will ... be a matter of considering the evidence presented on each application for the discharge of an independent children’s lawyer to determine if the evidence demonstrates sufficient lack of objectivity and professionalism on the part of the independent children’s lawyer such as to justify his or her discharge. the mere appearance of partiality to a particular ... position will not necessarily suffice to warrant the independent children’s lawyer’s removal. further, and perhaps indicative of this case, parents who are involved in litigation in this court about their children need to understand that, as part of his or her role, the independent children’s lawyer may legitimately and responsibly say things that are challenging and confronting to the parent in respect of his or her views about parenting and the best interests of his or her children in the particular circumstances of the case, but that does not necessarily mean that the independent children’s lawyer is not acting in accordance with his or her duties in the case.
