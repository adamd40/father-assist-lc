evidence relating to the husband’s application to set aside two binding financial agreements
application to set aside the financial agreements
legal principles
when financial agreements are binding   subject to subsection (1a), a financial agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement if, and only if:   the agreement is signed by all parties, and (b) before signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner about the effect of the agreement on the rights of that party and about the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to that party of making the agreement, and (c) either before or after signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that the advice referred to in paragraph (b) was provided to that party (whether or not the statement is annexed to the agreement), and (ca) a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (c) that was provided to a spouse party is given to the other spouse party or to a legal practitioner for the other spouse party, and (d) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   before signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with independent legal advice from a legal practitioner about the effect of the agreement on the rights of that party and about the advantages and disadvantages, at the time that the advice was provided, to that party of making the agreement, and (c) either before or after signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that the advice referred to in paragraph (b) was provided to that party (whether or not the statement is annexed to the agreement), and (ca) a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (c) that was provided to a spouse party is given to the other spouse party or to a legal practitioner for the other spouse party, and (d) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   either before or after signing the agreement, each spouse party was provided with a signed statement by the legal practitioner stating that the advice referred to in paragraph (b) was provided to that party (whether or not the statement is annexed to the agreement), and (ca) a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (c) that was provided to a spouse party is given to the other spouse party or to a legal practitioner for the other spouse party, and (d) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.  ) a copy of the statement referred to in paragraph (c) that was provided to a spouse party is given to the other spouse party or to a legal practitioner for the other spouse party, and (d) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.  ) a financial agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement if: (a) the agreement is signed by all parties, and (b) one or more of paragraphs (1)(b), (c) and (ca) are not satisfied in relation to the agreement, and (c) a court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made), and (d) the court makes an order under subsection (1b) declaring that the agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, and (e) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court. (1b) for the purposes of paragraph (1a)(d), a court may make an order declaring that a financial agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, upon application (the enforcement application ) by a spouse party seeking to enforce the agreement. (1c) to avoid doubt, section 90ka applies in relation to the enforcement application.   the agreement is signed by all parties, and (b) one or more of paragraphs (1)(b), (c) and (ca) are not satisfied in relation to the agreement, and (c) a court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made), and (d) the court makes an order under subsection (1b) declaring that the agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, and (e) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   one or more of paragraphs (1)(b), (c) and (ca) are not satisfied in relation to the agreement, and (c) a court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made), and (d) the court makes an order under subsection (1b) declaring that the agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, and (e) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   a court is satisfied that it would be unjust and inequitable if the agreement were not binding on the spouse parties to the agreement (disregarding any changes in circumstances from the time the agreement was made), and (d) the court makes an order under subsection (1b) declaring that the agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, and (e) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   the court makes an order under subsection (1b) declaring that the agreement is binding on the parties to the agreement, and (e) the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court.   a court may make such orders for the enforcement of a financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement as it thinks necessary.
this forensic obligation is properly conceptualised as the burden of introducing evidence and should not be confused with the burden of proof as a matter of law and pleading. for a discussion of the difference see purkess v crittenden [1965] hca 34, (1965) 114 clr 164 especially at 167-168 per barwick cj, kitto and taylor jj and 170-171 per windeyer j.
... how such a certificate is to be treated was also the subject of the decision of the full court in hoult. their honours were ad idem that the certificate given by the solicitor must be treated at least as prima facie evidence of compliance with the requirement to provide legal advice. further, that is bolstered by the presence in a financial agreement of recitals such as appeared in the agreement in this case, namely in recitals o, p, q and r, which in effect confirmed that the requisite legal advice was given. applying the principles emanating from hoult, what the reliance by the husband on the certificate, and the recitals, does is satisfy the initial onus on the husband, and passes the evidentiary burden to the wife. the certificate gave rise to “an inference, a presumption of fact or a presumptio hominis” (paragraph 97) that the requisite advice has been. the question then becomes whether the wife has adduced sufficient evidence to displace that inference. as was explained in hoult in paragraphs 101 and 279, that does not then require an inquiry into the content of the legal advice, but just as to whether the advice was given.
... there are different ways to prove the existence of undue influence. one method of proof is by direct evidence of the circumstances of the particular transaction...another way in which undue influence can be proved is by presumption.... a presumption, in the sense used here, arises where common experience is that the existence of one fact means that another fact also exists. common experience gives rise to a presumption that a transaction was not the exercise of a person’s free will if (i) the person is proved to be in a particular relationship, and (ii) the transaction is one, commonly involving a “substantial benefit” to another, which cannot be explained by “ordinary motives”, or “is not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties”. although the classes are not closed, in johnson v buttress latham cj described the relationships that could give rise to the presumption as including parent and child, guardian and ward, trustee and beneficiary, solicitor and client, physician and patient, and cases of religious influence. (footnotes omitted)   whether the agreement was offered on a basis that it was not subject to negotiation, (ii) the emotional circumstances in which the agreement was entered including any explicit or implicit threat to end a marriage or to end an engagement, (iii) whether there was any time for careful reflection, (iv) the nature of the parties’ relationship, (v) the relative financial positions of the parties, and (vi) the independent advice that was received and whether there was time to reflect on that advice.  ) the emotional circumstances in which the agreement was entered including any explicit or implicit threat to end a marriage or to end an engagement, (iii) whether there was any time for careful reflection, (iv) the nature of the parties’ relationship, (v) the relative financial positions of the parties, and (vi) the independent advice that was received and whether there was time to reflect on that advice.  i) whether there was any time for careful reflection, (iv) the nature of the parties’ relationship, (v) the relative financial positions of the parties, and (vi) the independent advice that was received and whether there was time to reflect on that advice.  ) the nature of the parties’ relationship, (v) the relative financial positions of the parties, and (vi) the independent advice that was received and whether there was time to reflect on that advice.   the relative financial positions of the parties, and (vi) the independent advice that was received and whether there was time to reflect on that advice.  ) the independent advice that was received and whether there was time to reflect on that advice.  otnotes omitted)
“in the latter the will of the innocent party is not independent and voluntary because it is overborne. in the former the will of the innocent party, even if independent and voluntary, is the result of the disadvantageous position in which he is placed and of the other party unconscientiously taking advantage of that position.” otnote omitted)
