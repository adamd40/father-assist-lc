the husband’s submissions
setting aside of orders altering property interests (1) where, on application by a person affected by an order made by a court under section 79 in property settlement proceedings, the court is satisfied that:   there has been a miscarriage of justice by reason of fraud, duress, suppression of evidence (including failure to disclose relevant information), the giving of false evidence or any other circumstance, or (b) in the circumstances that have arisen since the order was made it is impracticable for the order to be carried out or impracticable for a part of the order to be carried out, or (c) a person has defaulted in carrying out an obligation imposed on the person by the order and, in the circumstances that have arisen as a result of that default, it is just and equitable to vary the order or to set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order, or (d) in the circumstances that have arisen since the making of the order, being circumstances of an exceptional nature relating to the care, welfare and development of a child of the marriage, the child or, where the applicant has caring responsibility for the child (as defined in subsection (1aa)), the applicant, will suffer hardship if the court does not vary the order or set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order, or (e) a proceeds of crime order has been made covering property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or a proceeds of crime order has been made against a party to the marriage,
the court may, in its discretion, vary the order or set the order aside and, if it considers appropriate, make another order under section 79 in substitution for the order so set aside. (1a) a court may, on application by a person affected by an order made by a court under section 79 in property settlement proceedings, and with the consent of all the parties to the proceedings in which the order was made, vary the order or set the order aside and, if it considers appropriate, make another order under section 79 in substitution for the order so set aside. (1aa) for the purposes of paragraph (1)(d), a person has caring responsibility for a child if:   the person is a parent of the child with whom the child lives, or (b) a parenting order provides that:  the child is to live with the person, or (ii) the person has parental responsibility for the child.
.... at the time of the making of the orders there were a number of serious financial issues that were unknown and not disclosed by [mr farrant]. these included: (a) [mr farrant]’s failure to inform me and our workers compensation insurer of his systematic harassment of a family friend, [ms l], who had in a year or so prior to the separation became an employee of ours and which resulted in a large workers compensation payments after the orders and ongoing insurance premium hikes for years following, (b) taxation issues with poor or deficient record keeping and payment history which was concealed by him and which led to a winding up application against [j pty ltd] following the orders, placing me under enormous stress and financial difficulties as i had to find funds that did not exist in order to keep the business solvent and incorporated. this in turn destroyed my credit rating and that of the business and caused lasting losses with high interest payments and inability to raise finances to develop the business for several years.[12]   [mr farrant]’s failure to inform me and our workers compensation insurer of his systematic harassment of a family friend, [ms l], who had in a year or so prior to the separation became an employee of ours and which resulted in a large workers compensation payments after the orders and ongoing insurance premium hikes for years following, (b) taxation issues with poor or deficient record keeping and payment history which was concealed by him and which led to a winding up application against [j pty ltd] following the orders, placing me under enormous stress and financial difficulties as i had to find funds that did not exist in order to keep the business solvent and incorporated. this in turn destroyed my credit rating and that of the business and caused lasting losses with high interest payments and inability to raise finances to develop the business for several years.[12]   taxation issues with poor or deficient record keeping and payment history which was concealed by him and which led to a winding up application against [j pty ltd] following the orders, placing me under enormous stress and financial difficulties as i had to find funds that did not exist in order to keep the business solvent and incorporated. this in turn destroyed my credit rating and that of the business and caused lasting losses with high interest payments and inability to raise finances to develop the business for several years.[12]
a. at paragraph 63 the family report writer states: “...his difficulties include physical ones such as visual problems and motor problems affecting coordination and intellectual limitations. she commented that he has difficulties communicating verbally. she explains that he needs structured routines and will learn best in these situations when concepts and skills are modelled practised and augmented by prompting cueing and visual means. b. at paragraph 64: "[x]'s long term prospects for employment or independent living are unknown however like [mr n], [mr farrant]’s brother, it is likely that he will require some family support and involvement all of his life. " c. at paragraph 66: "...there is a strong likelihood that his prospects for employment and independent living in the future will be impacted by his disabilities ...parents of children with intellectual and physical disabilities often need to provide substantial and significant support not only when their children are young but throughout their lives... " i acknowledged his difficulties and took steps to put myself in a better position to assist [x]. for example, as deposed in my previous affidavit filed during the proceedings, on or about 25 august 2015, i did a key word signing course in melbourne to assist me in my communication endeavours with [x]. children's orders were made on 28 august 2015. under those orders it was anticipated that [ms farrant] would remain the primary care giver my time with [x] was limited, primarily as i lived interstate. it was ordered i would spend time with [x] one weekend a month during term time and additional time of a week in the term school holidays and two weeks over the summer school holidays. there are obligations on [ms farrant] to inform me of significant medical appointments.[14]
... [ms farrant] reported that [x] was not a child you could leave "with anyone" and that if he gets anxious or upset he starts biting and spitting. she leaves him with a friend [ms p] who can sign to communicate with him. she expressed concern that [mr farrant] might leave [x]with other people in an irresponsible fashion. she expressed no faith in his ability to care for [x], and considered that [mr farrant] has spent little time with [x] since separation and the time that he has had with him has been "supervised" time at school/child care. hence the step he proposes of taking what she described as "full responsibility" (meaning unsupervised overnight time) for [x] is opposed by her. [ms farrant] further expressed concern in relation to [x] travelling by car with his father to [town g] saying that it would be too much travel for a day visit, [x] is very tired anyway by the weekend, and that [x] often undoes his seatbelt and you have to pull over all the time to do it up again. she reported that it is great when she has her older children in the car as well as they entertain [x] so that he is less likely to undo his seatbelt. [ms farrant] provided information about [x] in relation to his allergy assessments, his hearing difficulties and what is and will be required for these issues. [ms farrant] said that she would not have a problem if [mr farrant] was present for any of [x]'s appointments. [ms farrant] spoke of the commitment involved for her when [x] had surgery ( in 2014 and needed some months of assistance afterwards. she said that the specialists had been very surprised at how soon [x] had begun to walk after the operations and she attributed his progress to twice daily [exercises] each day with [x]. she spoke of the expense of providing for [x]'s special needs and said that [mr farrant]’s financial contribution was "insulting". ... [x]'s needs to be reminded about going to the toilet and taken by an adult. he still has "accidents'. at school/child care [x] is on timed reminders in relation to toileting and apparently needs assistance to pull down his trousers and underpants, and supervision to stay on the toilet so that he can complete what needs to be done.[16]
28. i pay child support as assessed of approximately $200 per week. i have offered to pay further funds towards his medical expenses but this was declined by [ms farrant]. the information provided in these proceedings is the first time that i am able to obtain detailed information as to the current treatment direction. i acknowledge that providing care for someone with severe disability can be emotionally and physically draining. i know this because i am the carer for my disabled brother. i want to be part of [x]'s life and would be willing and able to live in tasmania to assist with his care or be his primary care giver. as stated above, i pay child support as assessed. i financially support my other children. other than being asked to pay the fees for 2 private schools, [ms farrant] has not asked for me to contribute to [x]'s medical costs. the pool of assets at the time that this matter was before the court in 2015/2016 was estimated to be $2,045,785. 36. i received about 18.8% of the pool of assets. under the orders i was to receive:
a. my superannuation worth approximately $54,000 b. [motor vehicle 4] $10,000 c. [motor vehicle 1] $18,000 d. [tools] $20,000 e. tool locker $750 f. [motor vehicle 2] and [motor vehicle 3] $23,000 g. sale proceeds from [town g] property $160,000. i started again and my financial position as set out in my financial statement is as a result of my work and acquisition of assets post separation. i have structured my financial position so that my company owns my assets and liabilities. i do so because of my past experiences of property divisions following a break down of relationships. i understand that this does not change how the law would apply, but structuring my assets and liabilities this way is what provides me with piece of mind. as stated above, i am willing and able to contribute to [x]'s medical needs but i have not been asked or informed about what these expenses are that are not covered by his ndis funding. [ms farrant] retained the income earning assets of the relationship. i agreed to this percentage division including the business because the [k pty ltd] was profitable and [ms farrant] would continue to be the primary caregiver of [x] who had higher needs, enabling her the flexibility that comes from running your own business. [ms farrant]'s current application has me receiving approximately 11% of the pool of assets as they were at the time.

hi [ms farrant] i’ve just read through all the reports you sent – i had the school psych report already but reviewed it again i’m wondering if a medication review would be helpful for [x]? he is currently on dexamphetamine ) long acting amphetamine, but there is some evidence that methylphenidate may be more effective in reducing the symptoms of odd (but not all studies agree with this conclusion). how tricky is it to get [x] to take his meds? i am wondering if short acting methylphenidate (ritalin) will be more effective at getting him up and out the door as well as giving him a second boost at 11am and potentially a third (maybe smaller) boost at 2pm? this way you still have “coverage” till about 6pm after which time you are preparing for bed. there is another adhd med which is not a stimulant. some people with adhd take this at night time as a way of dealing with the busyness in their heads that prevents sleep onset and restless sleep. it has a long half life of 17 hours (time it takes for ½ the dose to be processed out of your system) so an evening dose continues to work the following day. since i am not a doctor i am not able to advise whether this is suitable for [x], i’m just sharing what i understand to be the case for other clients. it is worth talking to your paed about though as it can take some time to find the sweet spot where adhd meds are concerned. i m not sure that reassessing [x]'s cognitive function will tell us anything useful – generally people’s iq’s don’t change much over time. a sensory assessment would be useful for day to day life and i note [ms s] has just completed a functional assessment. in terms of pathological demand avoidance, there are definite similarities and if you caught the presentation at last weekend’s conference you may have already been reading up on it some more ??. i’d be interested to see the response from nss regarding [x]'s enrolment refusal.
afternoon [ms r] the year certainly didn't get off to a smooth start for us, i can't emphasis enough, the dramatic changes that [x] has experienced since last christmas until now. the intensity of [x]'s care needs and the constant changes have been profound which impacts on my ability to stay on top of everything since our last visit in february i can't believe it's now the end of september. the unprecedented effects of puberty for [x] and transitioning him to high school has been a tiring struggle however the support and care along with the learning plan provided to [x] from [t school] has been amazing and better than i could have hoped for i feel so incredibly lucky. even with such a positive school environment [x] is almost every day running late as he is always so hard to get up and going often lost time in being distracted and its getting hard to transition from house to car then to school, [x] is so tried upon collection at 3 pm from and becomes so upset if we don't go straight, [ms u] has said that [x] is pretty much done from after lunch and requires mostly rest in the afternoons. once he arrives home, he is not interested in anything is becoming quite aggressive, currently i have stated using the visual posting and timers again with not a huge amount of success his behaviour is much better with male support workers and mostly enjoys doing some active after school actives. [t school] should be recognised for this as it was such a huge process to find the right high school, i will also send through the email chain that we are currently working through regarding [x]'s enrolment at [v school], which again has been denied. [ms u] from [t school] and [mr w] from [y organisation] and myself are currently working through. i have had a phone meeting this afternoon with [ms u] just going over [...] along with any other information that will help you. [ms u] has offered if you need to reach out to her directly please do so for our appointment on wednesday, at 3 p.m. i would like to review /plan including any assessments that you recommend for [x]. i will also require a current report from you for school, [...] and ( ndis ) change of assessment. i have and are considering the below along with any other recommendations from you. cognitive assessment see attached last one dated late 2020 anxiety and mood disorder assessment sensory assessment behaviour assessment including oppositional defiant and conduct disorder adaptive functioning assessment i have also attached a chew invoice as [x] has been biting through serval tops and he recently bitten and broke a phone so i was advised to use these and they have been very successful, however this will be a new ongoing cost as i am just about to order the second lot as he is using them every day. i have also attached his current medication, school psychologists report 2020 ot access report for the school [ms s] has completed a draft report also attached in a word document as i need to confirm / add in any other information.[22] (emphasis added)
the current results are based on [x]'s parents' rating of his behaviour using the basc-3 parent rating scales form and his current schoolteacher's rating using the basc-3 teacher rating scale form. scale scores in the clinically significant range suggest a high level of maladjustment. scores in the at­ risk range may identify a significant problem that may not be severe enough to require formal treatment or may identify the potential of developing a problem that needs careful monitoring. [x]'s scores on the basc-3 are provided below.[24] (emphasis added)
summary dismissal – the law
... no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting proceedings   the court may make a decree for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of a proceedings if:  the first party is defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings, and (b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings.
when there is no reasonable prospect of success   for the purposes of this section, a defence or proceedings or part of proceedings need not be:  hopeless, or (b) bound to fail,
to have no reasonable prospect of success.
proceedings that are frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process   the court may dismiss all or part of proceedings at any stage if it is satisfied that the proceedings or part is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process. (5) to avoid doubt, proceedings or a part of proceedings are not frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process merely because an application relating to the proceedings or the part is made and later withdrawn.   a party may apply for summary orders after a response has been filed if the party claims, in relation to the application or response, that:   the court has no jurisdiction, or (b) the other party has no legal capacity to apply for the orders sought, or (c) it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process, or (d) there is no reasonable likelihood of success.
16. further, the plurality said: the determination of the issue must only take into account the material on which the respondent seeks to make out the case, or as often expressed takes the respondent’s case “at its highest” unless the respondent’s version is inherently incredible or unreliable (see munnings v australian government solicitor [1994] hca 65, (1994) 68 aljr 169 at 171, bigg & suzi [1998] famca 14, (1998) flc 92-799, webster v lampard [1993] hca 57, (1993) 177 clr 598 at 608). ... the primary judge at [53] also correctly referred to and cited from the judgment of kirby j in lindon v commonwealth (no 2) [1996] hca 14, (1996) 136 alr 251 at 255–256, where his honour set out the approach to be taken in applications for summary relief, namely: it is a serious matter to deprive a person of access to the courts of law for it is there that the rule of law is upheld, including against government and other powerful interests. this is why relief, whether under o 26, r 18 or in the inherent jurisdiction of the court, is rarely and sparingly provided. to secure such relief, the party seeking it must show that it is clear, on the face of the opponent's documents, that the opponent lacks a reasonable cause of action or is advancing a claim that is clearly frivolous or vexatious. an opinion of the court that a case appears weak and such that it is unlikely to succeed is not, alone, sufficient to warrant summary termination. even a weak case is entitled to the time of a court. experience teaches that the concentration of attention, elaborated evidence and argument and extended time for reflection will sometimes turn an apparently unpromising cause into a successful judgment. summary relief of the kind provided for by o 26, r 18, for absence of a reasonable cause of action, is not a substitute for proceeding by way of demurrer. if there is a serious legal question to be determined, it should ordinarily be determined at a trial for the proof of facts may sometimes assist the judicial mind to understand and apply the law that is invoked and to do so in circumstances more conducive to deciding a real case involving actual litigants rather than one determined on imagined or assumed facts. if, notwithstanding the defects of pleadings, it appears that a party may have a reasonable cause of action which it has failed to put in proper form, a court will ordinarily allow that party to reframe its pleading. a question has arisen as to whether o 26, r 18 applies to part only of a pleading. however, it is unnecessary in this case to consider that question because the commonwealth's attack was upon the entirety of mr lindon's statement of claim. the guiding principle is, as stated in o 26, r 18(2), doing what is just. if it is clear that proceedings within the concept of the pleading under scrutiny are doomed to fail, the court should dismiss the action to protect the defendant from being further troubled, to save the plaintiff from further costs and disappointment and to relieve the court of the burden of further wasted time which could be devoted to the determination of claims which have legal merit. (footnotes omitted) (emphasis added) ... in wood v glaxo australia pty ltd [1993] qca 114, [1994] 2 qd r 431, an appeal against a refusal to order an extension of the period of limitation within which an action might be instituted, macrossan cj relevantly said at 434:
...it is nevertheless recognised as wrong to place potential plaintiffs in anything like a situation where they must on the probabilities show that it is likely they will succeed in their actions. a judge may harbour a feeling that there is a strong chance that particular applicants will fail at trial but, in my opinion, he should not act on the basis of this impression both because that is a question reserved for another occasion and because he cannot know and should not insist on being able to see in all of its ramifications the full strength of the case which will eventually be presented at trial. ... a similar approach is to be taken in applications for summary dismissal. the court does not undertake a preliminary trial, nor is a detailed hearing of the case on its merits required.[29] (emphasis added)
section 79a(1)(d) – the law  where, on application by a person affected by an order made by a court under section 79 in property settlement proceedings, the court is satisfied that:
... (d) in the circumstances that have arisen since the making of the order, being circumstances of an exceptional nature relating to the care, welfare and development of a child of the marriage, the child or, where the applicant has caring responsibility for the child (as defined in subsection (1aa)), the applicant, will suffer hardship if the court does not vary the order or set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order, ... the court may, in its discretion, vary the order or set the order aside and, if it considers appropriate, make another order under section 79 in substitution for the order so set aside.   in the circumstances that have arisen since the making of the order, being circumstances of an exceptional nature relating to the care, welfare and development of a child of the marriage, the child or, where the applicant has caring responsibility for the child (as defined in subsection (1aa)), the applicant, will suffer hardship if the court does not vary the order or set the order aside and make another order in substitution for the order,
it is clear that three elements must be satisfied before an order can be made setting aside property orders pursuant to s 79a(1)(d). first, there must be circumstances that have arisen since the making of the order, being circumstances of an exceptional nature relating to the care, welfare and development of a child. secondly, it must be demonstrated that the applicant (not the child) will suffer hardship if the court does not vary the order or set the order aside and make another order in substitution of the order. thirdly, what might be described as a further discretionary element, that is, the court may vary the order if it considers appropriate and make another order under s 79 in substitution for the order so set aside.[30]
the husband had to establish “circumstances of an exceptional nature” for his case pursuant to s 79a(1)(d) to succeed. her honour needed to be satisfied, as a matter of law, that he had done so. only after being satisfied as to “exceptional circumstances” and “hardship” could her honour proceed to exercise the discretion to grant the relief which the husband sought. in simpson & hamlin (supra) the full court held that the moving of children to the other parent, after the making of orders, “could not of itself be held to be an unusual circumstance”. their honours quoted with approval the remarks of the trial judge (at 79,657):
... the ordinary vicissitudes of life coupled with the difficulties that parties to a marriage often experience in the task of restructuring their lives following the dissolution of their marriage and their assets, and their obligations to the support of each other and the support, care and control of their children, frequently create situations where it is desirable having regard to the children’s welfare that such a change occurs.
the full court considered that in these conclusions the trial judge was correct (p 79,657) and said:
the question therefore was whether the change which occurred in this case was such as to “take it out of and beyond the ordinary circumstances in which such change might be reasonably expected to occur’’. he saw that feature in the present case in “the fact that the change occurred unexpectedly and so quickly after the making of the property order’’. ... his honour in our view stated correctly the law applicable on this point. what amounts to “exceptional circumstances’’ is very much a question of fact and degree. with findings on such matters an appellate tribunal is reluctant to interfere. whilst we might have had some hesitation ourselves as to whether or not in the light of the history of these parties and their admitted future intention, the change of custodial arrangements was so exceptional as to take it out of the normal vicissitudes of life, it was in our view a finding which his honour was entitled to make on the evidence and which we cannot disturb.
the decision of the full court in simpson & hamlin (supra) did not put any additional gloss on the words of s 79a(1)(d). the judgment reiterated that the legislature has placed a relatively high onus on an applicant who seeks relief pursuant to s 79a(1)(d). the plain words of the sub-section indicate that it was not intended to cover, per se, a situation where children leave a parent who has received the benefit of an adjustment pursuant to s 75(2) on account of their future care. the successful applicant must establish “exceptional circumstances” relating to the care, welfare and development of a child of the marriage.[31]
the importance of bringing an end to litigation remains an important consideration and the remarks of mason j remain applicable to para (d) mutatis mutandis. to paraphrase his honour’s remarks: it is not sufficient that it appears that circumstances have arisen of an exceptional nature resulting in hardship to the applicant, the court must consider in the exercise of its discretion whether that hardship is of such a serious nature and results in such inequity that it can only be rectified by the extreme step of setting aside or varying an existing order of the court.[33]
“the fact that since the parties entered into the agreement the younger child has been diagnosed with autism, adding significantly to what is required of the parties for his care physically and emotionally and to some extent financially, is a material change relating to his care welfare and development”. i note however that in fewster & drake [2016] famcafc 214 the full court noted at paragraph 48 that the test required to establish “material change” is a lower threshold than which applies to circumstances of an “exceptional nature”.[34]
albeit that at the time of the orders, b suffered some ill-health, on the unchallenged evidence of the mother, eds and it’s sequelae for b and necessarily for the mother, amounted to circumstances of an exceptional nature. there is no suggestion that eds was a foreseeable development of a condition suffered by b before the orders were made. there is no suggestion that b was as debilitated prior to the making of the orders as she was at any time after she was found to be suffering from eds. similarly, there is no suggestion that the parenting load and the practical impost on the wife of b’s care when the orders were made was as significant and time consuming as has been the case since b was found to be suffering from eds. i accept that the consequences of the deterioration in b’s health since the 2014 orders are circumstances of an exceptional nature.[35] (emphasis added)
consideration
the year certainly didn't get off to a smooth start for us, i can't emphasis enough, the dramatic changes that [x] has experienced since last christmas until now. the intensity of [x]'s care needs and the constant changes have been profound which impacts on my ability to stay on top of everything since our last visit in february i can't believe it's now the end of september. the unprecedented effects of puberty for [x] and transitioning him to high school has been a tiring struggle however the support and care along with the learning plan provided to [x] from [t school] has been amazing and better than i could have hoped for i feel so incredibly lucky...[36]
"[x]'s long-term prospects for employment or independent living are unknown however like [mr n], [mr farrant]’s brother, it is likely that he will require some family support and involvement all of his life." (emphasis added)
the word ‘some’ arguably turned out to be an understatement.
