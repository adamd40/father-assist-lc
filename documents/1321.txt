overview
short history
5. whether our client’s earning capacity is affected when he is suffering the symptoms of his condition and how his capacity is affected. i assume that [mr roth]’s earning capacity has been affected during the time-periods where he has taken some time away from work. it is my understanding that he is self-employed, and that there are no ‘leave entitlements’ for him to rely on. it would seem that [mr roth]’s capacity to work has been improving over the past 18 months, and i would imagine that this would continue to be the trend, barring any further incidents that would exacerbate his symptoms, such as may occur during settlement processes. there is always possibility for [mr roth] to potentially experience a relapse of his symptoms in the future, particularly if there are further incidents between him and his ex-wife. however, i am hopeful that should these not occur, then [mr roth] would likely not relapse.[4]
the wife’s interim property proceedings
.... the applicant has the funds available for use in [country d] and it is not reasonable for her to quarantine those funds in a hope that the value grows in the current circumstances.[17]
funds, assets and financial resources currently available to meet the wife's request for $200,000. the respondent states although the [country d] funds are in the applicant's name there were gifted jointly (see the respondent's affidavit paragraphs 21, 22 and 49). any sale of assets to fund a part property settlement crystallises loss. the respondent cannot access the [o company] as stated as the account has been locked. to provide funds to pay the applicant's legal costs is not just and equitable in all the circumstances given the funds the applicant has had since separation and the funds she has access to make the payment in any event. the applicant has prioritised international travel and should have used those funds to pay legal fees.[19] (original emphasis)
the law — interim property proceedings  identify “the parties’ property and of their interests in it” (medlow & medlow (2016) flc 93-692 at [69]), and   consider and apply the provisions of s 79 (strahan at [135]). any interim property order should not exhaust the discretion in s 79 of the act. in strahan at [136] the full court said: as to the third matter identified at 79,930 by the full court in harris, in discussion before us it was described as the “adjustment issue” or “claw-back issue”. it was submitted by senior counsel for the wife that it is relevant to consider whether an order would give the applicant “more than they would be indubitably entitled to on a final hearing” or alternatively “would it give them so much that it could not be adjusted on a final hearing?”. as we have observed the full court in zschokke at 83,220-221 stressed the importance of consideration of the “adjustment issue” if the power in s 80(1)(h) of the act is being exercised. we accept the submission and observe that this matter is relevant because the discretion conferred by the power in s 79 is to make such order as the court considers appropriate provided it is just and equitable to make the order in circumstances where the power will not be exhausted by the interim order. as bryant cj and coleman j observed in gabel v yardley at [69] and [72] the interim order must be capable of variation or reversal without resort to s 79a of the act or appeal. as finn j said at [126] the interim order must be “capable of alteration at any time prior to, or as part of, the final exercise of the s 79 power”. in osferatu & osferatu [2012] famca 408, watts j at [41] made clear a detailed inquiry is not required: as was discussed in harris and confirmed in strahan, the second step in making an interim property order is to have regard to the usual matters in a section 79 order (ss 79(2) and 79(4) fla). a detailed inquiry is not required, but there must be some assessment of section 79 factors. given it is an imprecise exercise, the interim property order has to be “conservative” so that the final outcome of property settlement will not be compromised by the interim property order. either the remaining property needs to be sufficient to meet the legitimate expectations of both parties at the final hearing, or the order that is contemplated needs to be capable of being reversed or adjusted if it is subsequently considered necessary to do so.
consideration
interim distribution to the wife
‘[209] the court may use this power [section 79] to “require the party who controls most of the assets of the parties to provide the other party with funds to conduct his or her case, with the provision of such funds then being a matter to be taken into account in the final settlement of property between the parties”: zschokke at 83,215 ... [226] ... once the court has determined that the interests of justice require it to exercise the power, the condition on which the power is to be exercised are governed only by the obligation to make an order that is “appropriate” and to ensure that the proposed order is “just and equitable” by reference to the matters set out in s 79(4).’ since separation, the husband has received all income from the parties’ joint assets. the husband has been able to support himself without selling capital assets but has also been able to save a significant amount of money in accounts he has opened post separation in his sole name. furthermore, the husband holds the resources of [e pty ltd], and salary and/or dividends which result from the operation of the husband’s business. the extent of these earnings is significant, and the husband has complete discretion as to amount in which he is to receive.[22] (emphasis added)   identify “the parties’ property and of their interests in it” (medlow & medlow (2016) flc 93-692 at [69]), and (b) consider and apply the provisions of s 79 strahan at [135].   consider and apply the provisions of s 79 strahan at [135].   will the payment of $200,000 to the wife defeat the husband’s claim for an equal division of the net non-superannuation assets, at trial? (b) are there funds available to pay the wife $200,000, outside of the monies invested in country d? (c) should the wife use some or all her country d investment to meet some part of her stated expenses?   are there funds available to pay the wife $200,000, outside of the monies invested in country d? (c) should the wife use some or all her country d investment to meet some part of her stated expenses?   should the wife use some or all her country d investment to meet some part of her stated expenses?
that is, he is content for her to receive $200,000, but from the country d fund.
conclusion regarding an interim property distribution
the wife’s claim for spousal maintenance
... as per the wife’s financial statement filed 8 may 2023, she has a total average weekly income of $115 before tax. this consists of the $500 which the husband pays the wife each month. as for the wife’s total average weekly expenditure, such is estimated to be $2,425. therefore, there exists an offset of $2,310. the applicant has a range of needs and expenses all of which are reasonable and made apparent in her financial statement filed 8 may 2023. importantly, the wife has exhausted her entitlement to medicare funded surgeries. as recognised above the wife has multiple complex health issues in which require regular scans, specialist attention, and further surgeries. without an order for spouse maintenance, the wife will be unable to afford private health insurance.[46]
to what extent can the applicant support herself? 42. the affidavit of [dr l] is untested, disputed and cannot be relied upon. the respondent's affidavit refers to applicant's [work] qualifications and the applicant's ability to return to such a career. the respondent has health issues as outlined in paragraph 65 of his affidavit however continues to work.[49] (original emphasis)
the law — spousal maintenance
a party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first-mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately... (a) by reason of having the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, (b) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment, or (c) for any other adequate reason,
these considerations are to be assessed with regard to any of the relevant matters under s75(2).
that threshold is whether the applicant “is unable to support herself or himself adequately” by reason of the matters set out in (a), (b), or (c) of that section, but having regard to any relevant matter referred to in sub-section 75(2). thus, the question of whether the applicant can support herself “adequately” is not to be determined by reference to any fixed or absolute standard but having regard to the matters referred to in s 75(2) and more specifically the paragraphs of that sub-section identified above. nor is that question to be determined upon a “subsistence” level, as earlier cases under state maintenance legislation suggested. in nutting and nutting (1978) flc 90-410 at 77, 094 lindenmayer j said:
“by sec. 72 of the act, the respondent is liable to maintain the applicant only to the extent that she is incapable of supporting herself adequately, and again ‘adequately’ imports a standard of living which is reasonable in the circumstances, including the circumstances that the parties are no longer husband and wife and that the assets and resources which were formerly available to them both in common have now been divided between them.” (emphasis added)   to what extent is the wife unable to support herself, (b) what are the wife’s reasonable needs, (c) what capacity does the husband have to meet a spousal maintenance order if such an order was to be made, and (d) if the wife’s circumstances favour an order for spousal maintenance to be made, then what order is reasonable having regard to s75(2) of the act.   what are the wife’s reasonable needs, (c) what capacity does the husband have to meet a spousal maintenance order if such an order was to be made, and (d) if the wife’s circumstances favour an order for spousal maintenance to be made, then what order is reasonable having regard to s75(2) of the act.   what capacity does the husband have to meet a spousal maintenance order if such an order was to be made, and (d) if the wife’s circumstances favour an order for spousal maintenance to be made, then what order is reasonable having regard to s75(2) of the act.   if the wife’s circumstances favour an order for spousal maintenance to be made, then what order is reasonable having regard to s75(2) of the act.
whilst adequate needs can often be inferred from a person’s expenses, such expenses may not extend to reasonable needs. a person with no income and who cannot pay any expenses, still has needs. thirdly, what are assessed to be ‘reasonable needs’ are to be assessed having regard to the parties’ previous standard of living. this was confirmed in brown and brown [2007] famca 151, (2007) flc 93-316 where the court said (at 81,455):
where possible both spouses should continue to live after separation at the level which they previously enjoyed if this is reasonable.
... reasonable means reasonable in all of the circumstances, not subsistence (evans and evans [1978] famca 23, (1978) flc 90-435, bevan and bevan [1995] famca 95, (1995) flc 92-600 and mitchell and mitchell (1995) flc 92-601).[56]
a claim for maintenance is not limited by reference to current expenses because an applicant applying for maintenance may not have the ability to pay for commitments necessary to support themselves (s 75(2)(d) of the act) and thus avoid incurring what otherwise would be a reasonable expense. therefore, the focus is on what is necessary for support. often, and conveniently, the identification of reasonable needs may be done by reference to expenses that are currently being incurred but obviously, that will not be possible or lead to adequate support in all cases. it is reasonable to claim that you need more money than you are currently spending (seitzinger & seitzinger [2014] famcafc 244, (2014) flc 93-626 at [53]).[57]
the “capacity” to meet an order for interim spousal maintenance is not confined to income. once a party, such as the wife in this case, establishes an entitlement to interim spousal maintenance, and such entitlement is quantified in accordance with that spouse’s reasonable needs, an order may be made notwithstanding that the liable spouse could only satisfy the order out of capital or borrowings against capital assets.
another consequence is that on an application for interim maintenance the court conducts “not as final or exhaustive a hearing as would be the case if one were hearing the matter finally”: williamson and williamson [1978] famca 57, (1978) flc 190-505, (1978) 4 fam. l.r. 355 at flc p.77,650, fam. l.r. p. 359 per fogarty j. the evidence need not be so extensive and the findings not so precise. having regard to those factors, and the general injunction of sec. 97(3), the court should in such matters have a greater degree of flexibility than it possesses in applications for maintenance which are intended to last for an indefinite period and can only be varied under sec.83.[61]
it would seem that [mr roth]’s capacity to work has been improving over the past 18 months, and i would imagine that this would continue to be the trend, barring any further incidents that would exacerbate his symptoms, such as may occur during settlement processes. there is always possibility for [mr roth] to potentially experience a relapse of his symptoms in the future, particularly if there are further incidents between him and his ex-wife. however, i am hopeful that should these not occur, then [mr roth] would likely not relapse.[69]
