reasons for judgment
judge glass:
sorry i am in sickbay, i am not we’ll need medical attention i can’t proceed i’m so sorry i don’t know where my support worker is, not sure what to do or how else to inform the court regards [ms racine]
primary considerations
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both of her parents
the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
each made significant claims of family violence from the other during the relationship, and despite the protective order for the mother, the type of seemingly highly immature and self-serving lifestyles led by the parties during their drug-addled days, makes it almost impossible to discern who bore greater responsibility for the undoubted family violence between them. nevertheless, now that they live so far apart and seemingly rarely even speak to one another, this suggests the risk of further family violence to likely be quite minimal.[4]
additional considerations
...[the father’s] apparent commitment to the child and his obvious intense involvement in all aspects of her special needs.[5]
...the mother did not present as well, and specifically she did not refer to her organising or being involved in any specific special needs programs for the child when in her care around her home at [suburb h] as complementary to those seemingly centrally involved by the father in [town e].[6]
she seemed to lack balanced thinking or insight about her role as a parent under separated conditions, as well as her former behaviour. and most critically, she seemed to not have any priority to always understand and to try and implement her shared responsibilities to the child in a cooperative and civil way.[7]
...she did not appear to have the willingness or insight sufficient to take substantial if any real responsibility for her former lifestyle and related behaviour, rather it was very clear that she had an almost fixated view that she was the so unfairly treated victim and a good parent, and others, especially her different partners, including the father in this matter, were much more responsible for her poor parenting than she was.[8]
given the writer’s understanding of the child, especially considering that her disabilities and delayed development has meant that she has qualified for ndis support at such a very young age, it seems unusual for such a child to spend so much time at daycare when she is in the mother’s care, surely, a mother genuinely aware of the child’s apparent profound developmental delays, and genuinely committed to her would want to protect her child, and not in any way potentially expose her to emotional or social distress, as could quite reasonably happen when she is attending daycare so often.[9]
it has been identified that the funds have not been utilised to support [x] and have instead been used for carpet cleaning, house cleaning, uber and ipad that is not supported or recommended by the speech pathologist. ... ...therapy providers are out of pocket as they have not been paid for services to [j company] a registered provider.[10]
parental responsibility
...[the parties] showed absolutely no trust or respect for one another and each evidenced strong doubts about either the other’s parenting capacity or commitment to a child who seemingly now has very significant everyday developmental issues, and is likely to possibly have long-term, if not even possibly lifelong special needs issues.[14]
conclusions
...if the father’s overall strong allegations against the mother’s lack of commitment to the child were to be substantially proven, it suggests that the child with such high level needs, and especially the need for unconditional love and close personal physical contact from either parent, as well as everyday close monitoring, guidance and encouragement from each parent, would be better off living with the father and spending less and only alternate weekend time with the mother, with all her education and special developmental supports resting with the father and his family.[16]
