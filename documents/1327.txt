legal principles
25 in whitford & whitford [1979] famca 3, (1979) flc 90-612 at 78,145, the full court said:
in ordinary parlance, hardship means something more burdensome than “any appreciable detriment”. we consider that in subsec. 44(4) the word should have its usual, though not necessarily its most stringent, connotations. it is impossible to lay down in advance what particular facts may or may not amount to hardship in the relevant sense. we observe that in family law (2022, 7th ed) at [36.120], riethmuller and smith note that what constitutes appreciable detriment necessarily depends upon the circumstances of each case, stating that: in many cases the substantial detriment is the inability of a spouse to pursue a claim for maintenance or an alteration or property interests where the resulting loss is significant in the light of his or her financial circumstances. the applicant for relief’s prospects of success in the proceedings, if leave is granted, is relevant to both the question of hardship and the second task undertaken by the court, which is to consider matters going to the exercise of discretion generally. this is because “[if] the probable result of the hearing on the merits is that hardship is not likely to be alleviated, then the court cannot be satisfied that the applicant would suffer hardship if leave were not granted”: v and s [2006] fcwa 2 (“v and s”), per thackray j at [6]. as recently noted by austin j in skelton and lindop [2022] fedcfamc1a 47, (2022) 64 fam lr 617 (“skelton and lindop”) at [16]–[21], there is differing authority as to the test to be applied in determining the prospects of success. those tests range from the need to establish “prima facie claim” to the need to establish “a real probability of success.” we respectfully acknowledge and adopt the reasoning of austin j that the appropriate test to apply is whether the applicant for relief had “sufficient likelihood of success” to prove hardship. in the event of the trial judge finding that the applicant for relief would suffer hardship if an extension of time was not granted, it is then necessary for the trial judge to consider those matters going to the exercise of discretion. in v and s, thackray j noted at [7] that, in addition to prospects of success, other potentially relevant considerations to the exercise of discretion may include the following: the extent of the delay and the reasons (or absence of reasons) for the delay: althaus & althaus (1982) flc 91-233, the extent of the hardship the applicant would experience if leave were not granted: carlon & carlon [1982] famca 60, (1982) flc 91-272, and the extent of the prejudice that would be caused to the respondent if leave were granted. in frost & nicholson [1981] famca 45, (1981) flc 91-051 (“frost & nicholson”) at 76,425, nygh j said that prejudice, in this context, “means that a party is faced with an action which he or she had no reason to expect or had been led to believe would not be brought”. however, in atwill & atwill [1981] famca 72, (1981) flc 91-107 (“atwill & atwill”) at 76,794, nygh j stated that the relevant prejudice would need to be “distinctly observable hardship, such as financial commitments made on the basis that no liability existed”. it appears to us that the extent of any prejudice is simply one of the relevant factors to consider and that nygh j’s comments in these two cases should be read as descriptive of circumstances where prejudice is likely to be a weighty factor, not a test for the relevance of evidence of prejudice. additionally, in atwill & atwill, his honour also pointed out that the fact that the respondent will suffer prejudice does not necessarily mean that the discretion will be exercised in their favour.
... applications seeking an interlocutory order under s 44(3) of the act are generally dealt with on the basis that the applicant’s evidence is presumed to be correct “unless it is inherently unbelievable or contradictory” (jacenko & jacenko [1986] famca 25, (1986) flc 91-776 at [14], skelton & lindop at [36]). it is important to appreciate that it is only in the event of leave being granted that the court, at final hearing, will make a determination in respect to the accuracy or otherwise of the parties’ competing factual contentions.
... it is true the appellant did not lead evidence to explain why she omitted to bring her claim with the two-year limitation period, which is of course usually an influential factor, but it is not of itself necessarily fatal (emerald & emerald [2018] famcafc 217, (2018) flc 93-870 at [128], carlon & carlon [1982] famca 60, (1982) flc 91-272 at 77,533). significantly, the appellant sent a letter to the respondent in march 2018 (just before the limitation period expired) foreshadowing her intention to bring a claim, so he was on notice. the primary judge was satisfied the further eight months which then elapsed before the claim was actually filed in november 2018 was “not substantial” (at [94]). moreover, the primary judge found the only prejudice the respondent would suffer if the appellant’s claim was allowed to proceed out of time would be the legal costs he would bear in defending her claim – but he would have been put to that expense anyway if the appellant’s claim was brought within time.
