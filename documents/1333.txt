reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
the consent orders of 30 august 2023 do resume noting the father is next due to spend time with the child on 15 december 2023.
we confirm that this matter was before his honour judge brown yesterday 14 december 2023. while we are mindful of the position taken by his honour, we are instructed that the department for child protection have opened a file and been investigating the matter as of the 7 december 2023. our client maintains her position that she will not provide the child to you as she has considerable concern about the child's welfare in your care.   if, in proceedings under this act: (a) a party (the examining party) intends to cross‑examine another party (the witness party), and (b) there is an allegation of family violence between the examining party and the witness party, and (c) any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   a party (the examining party) intends to cross‑examine another party (the witness party), and (b) there is an allegation of family violence between the examining party and the witness party, and (c) any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   there is an allegation of family violence between the examining party and the witness party, and (c) any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   any of the following are satisfied: (i) either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,   either party has been convicted of, or is charged with, an offence involving violence, or a threat of violence, to the other party, (ii) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,  ) a family violence order (other than an interim order) applies to both parties, (iii) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,  i) an injunction under section 68b or 114 for the personal protection of either party is directed against the other party, (iv) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,  ) the court makes an order that the requirements of subsection (2) are to apply to the cross-examination,
then the requirements of subsection (2) apply to the cross-examination.
this section applies both in the case where the examining party is the alleged perpetrator of the family violence and the witness party is the alleged victim, and in the case where the examining party is the alleged victim and the witness party is the alleged perpetrator.
accordingly, if a banning notice is made the ban applies to each party.
the department do not have an open case in relation to the child, [x]. since the department provided information to the court on 14 december 2023, the department have received an excessive amount of child protection notifications in relation to [x]. this reported information pertains to allegations that [x] may have been sexually abused by her father, this has been previously reported to the department. in 2024 the department received further child protection information in relation to [x] on over 25 occasions. the reported information concerns relating to [x] disclosing her father has touched her on her private parts, [x] is distressed with having contact with her father again. reported concerns [x] alleged that her father and his partner [ms d] "hit her". reported concerns that the father allegedly "drugged" [x] on one occasion. the most recent child protection concerns were received on 25 january 2024. the reported information pertained to the mother employing a private investigator in relation to the concerns for [x]. the information reported to the department was assessed as not requiring departmental intervention. departmental records to (sic) not reflect there is a current sapol investigation at this time.[1]
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.[3]
this is the standard which i must apply to the allegation that x has been subject to sexual abuse as well as the issue of the level of risk mr faulkner poses because he is alleged to have recently assaulted mr e.
...courts must be aware that not all allegations of sexual abuse are true. false allegations may be made either by parents acting in good faith, as a result of a misperception of information about their child, or by parents deliberately fabricating allegations in order to gain an advantage in proceedings. ambiguous events often have an innocent explanation.[4]
the legal context
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
background
chronology of proceedings
the family report
it was evident that [ms mottram] has lost trust in [mr faulkner] whereby she finds it difficult to communicate with him. [ms mottram] said that she values routine and consistency for [x]. with the history of alleged time and date changes for the care of [x] by [mr faulkner], the mother likely does not feel that the father sees consistency as a similar priority... it was evident that [mr faulkner] has a bitterness toward [ms mottram] for proceeding to court. at several points, the respondent stated that he does not feel the legal process and ongoing dispute is in [x’s] best interest. [mr faulkner] described feelings of manipulation, helplessness and an “uphill battle” to continue to care for [x]. it was evident that [mr faulkner] feels communication with [ms mottram] is not affective as he has concerns that what he says will be used against him by [ms mottram’s] lawyers.[6]   faulkner] had positive interactions with [x] whereby he encouraged her to seek toys to play with as she desired. [x] chose a book with confidence and [mr faulkner] read the story to [x]. [mr faulkner] was able to stop and start the book as [x] was engaged with various toys. [mr faulkner] and [x] were observed to be sitting on the floor together during the entire observation. [x] and [mr faulkner] were observed to share laughter. at one point, [x] hit [mr faulkner] with a hammer. [mr faulkner] provided [x] education about not hitting others, [x] appeared to understand and stopped easily. [mr faulkner] was complimentary of [x] whereby he remarked on her outfit and told [x] she was clever. the father engaged with the child about her home life with her mother in a positive way. [mr faulkner] was not aware that [x] would be present at the interviews and was visibly excited when he learnt he would see her. the father provided the child learning opportunities and engaged about her mother’s family and home in a positive way.[7]   faulkner] and [ms mottram] were observed to cross paths a couple of times throughout the interview. except for a brief hello, neither party enquired nor made small talk with the other. there appeared to be no warmth or respect between the parties whereby it is very likely [x] would notice this and perhaps feel split in her loyalty between her parents. it is unclear if either parent understands how they have contributed to the parenting dispute given they both asserted throughout the interview that their actions were in [x’s] interests. it cannot be determined by the family consultant as to how open either parents are to hearing [x’s] views or expert advice about their child.[8]
events after the release of the family report  early] 2023, the department received allegations that [x] disclosed on [the previous day], step father [mr e] hit her on the hand/arm when she was naughty. it was alleged that the step father [mr e] often made comments to her such as "your daddy does not love you" and "you don't need your (paternal) grandmother as you have my grandmother now". [in early] 2023, the department received allegations that associates of the father [mr faulkner] went to the father [mr faulkner’s] residence and threatened "you have till the morning to drop the case and if you don't i will come back tomorrow night to beat the shit out of you and your kids and your missus, i don't give a fuck, i will make your kids watch". it was alleged that [ms d] was extremely fearful that the men would return and assault her, [mr faulkner] and the children.[9]
by consent it is ordered: that paragraph 2c of the order of 28 july 2023 be varied such that the child spend time with the father in week 2 of 2, from the conclusion of kindergarten (or 3pm if a non-kindergarten day) until 6.30pm on friday, commencing 8 september 2023. that the time referred to in paragraph 2a of the order of 28 july 2023 be extended to conclude at 9am. that for christmas in 2023, the child spends time with the mother from 3pm on christmas eve to 3pm on christmas day and with the father from 3pm christmas day to 3pm boxing day. any handovers that do not occur at the child’s school, kindergarten or oshc/childcare do occur at the entrance of kmart, [suburb b] or at such other place as may be agreed between the parties in writing. that the child’s clothing worn to kindergarten on such friday, including shoes, are to be returned to the mother at handover that evening in the event it being necessary to change the child in the father’s care. that the mother be at liberty to enrol the child at [m school] to commence reception from term 1 of 2024. that the father be at liberty to obtain school reports, photographs, newsletters and the like from the child’s school and kindergarten at his sole expense and a copy of this order stand as authority for the same. that the parties be at liberty to attend all extracurricular activities and kindergarten/school function and events which parents are usually invited to attend. that the parties communicate via email for all communication relating to the care, development and welfare of the child including the topic of handovers.
the present proceedings  late] 2023 [c] was having some nappy free time, i was cooking and [x] and [c] were within my hearing. [x] asked if she could be nakey like [c] and i said yes as they were about to get ready for bed. [x] began touching [c’s] genitals. i told her it's [c’s] body and his space she is not to touch it or anyone else's. i asked if anybody is touching her private parts, and she began crying and said "daddy." she then said she is touched inside her shorts but later said on top of her shorts. [x] did not give clear details about what she meant by this at that time as she was very upset. i did not press her, i comforted her and listened. she mentioned an argument at the father's house and that it had happened in "her other room, her bedroom and [h’s] bedroom. ([h] is the father's partner's son, his partner is [ms d]). [the next day], i told [x] that i would have to speak with someone about what she said daddy did. [x] asked who i was going to tell and i responded, "probably a doctor." she replied, "well what about the police?" i said that i might tell the police and she nodded. i asked her if she felt safe with her daddy and she said, "yes but not when he touches my private parts." on the same day, in the evening, i asked [x] how she was feeling after telling me about dad. she replied, "good." i mentioned she wasn't going to see her dad for a little bit while we figure out how she can be safe and happy. she smiled and said, "that's okay." she appeared relieved. i asked her if there was anything else she wanted to tell me or speak to me about and she gave me her soft [toy] that she named '[...]'. she said, "maybe ask [the toy] if her daddy touches" while pointing to her bottom and vagina area. after that conversation [x] returned to the lounge room where the maternal grandmother was. i went to put my younger son to bed. the following morning [x] was acting like a completely different child. prior to this she had been showing anger and aggression toward all family members.
as for the alleged sexual abuse, i have not had direct reports form [x]. when these concerns were brought to me i had a long discussion with [x] about the people in her life and the things she likes doing. following on from her report of the wetting through the night i asked if her father had ever touched her in the private area. she then got under the chair and said “i don’t know, i don’t know.[12]  s] relationship with her father has been severed because he poses an unreasonable risk of serious harm to her. her mood has significantly improved and her physical expressions of anxiety have disappeared since time spending with the father ceased. [x] is now a much happier and relaxed child. she does not ask for her father.
on [the previous day], [x], [c] and i stayed at my mum's house as i had been afraid to return home in case the father came to my house. the following morning [...] i left [x] with my mum and returned home with my son [c] to organise our things for a holiday [...] for the weekend. [c’s] father [mr e] came over to spend some time with [c] before we went away. [mr e] and i left my house in separate cars at roughly 2 pm. both [mr e] and i drove towards [the same street]. [mr e] was turning left and i was turning right to go pick up [x] from my mums home. as [mr e] turned, i saw the father driving behind him. i received a phone call from [mr e] at 2.07 pm telling me i needed to be careful because the father had just attacked him whilst sitting in his car. the father has [assaulted mr e] and [injured him]. [mr e] made a report to the police... [mr e] told me the police were investigating, that they has cctv footage of the incident and that multiple witnesses had seen the attack and reported it. the father is currently facing serious assault charges.  iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.   an assault, including a sexual assault, of the child, or   a person (the first person ) involving the child in a sexual activity with the first person or another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly, as a sexual object by the first person or the other person, and where there is unequal power in the relationship between the child and the first person, or (c) causing the child to suffer serious psychological harm, including (but not limited to) when that harm is caused by the child being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, or   causing the child to suffer serious psychological harm, including (but not limited to) when that harm is caused by the child being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, or   serious neglect of the child.
...it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children’s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children’s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s ability to care for the children.
the assessment of risk is one of the many burdens placed on family law decision makers. risk assessment comprises two elements – the first requires prediction of the likelihood of the occurrence of harmful events, and the second requires consideration of the severity of the impact caused by those events. in our view, the assessment of risk in cases involving the welfare of children cannot be postponed until the last piece of evidence is given and tested, and the last submission is made. we accept, however, that it is always a question of degree depending on the evidence that is before the court.  part from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing.
