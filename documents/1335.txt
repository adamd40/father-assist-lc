standard of proof  without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.
respondent’s no case to answer submission  the evidence adduced by the applicant, taken at its highest and drawing all available inferences in favour of the applicant, is sufficient to demonstrate that on each relevant occasion, he placed a call to speak with the children and that call was not answered or returned, with the result that telephone communication therefore did not take place in accordance with the orders. (b) the evidence adduced by the father with respect to these remaining counts is supported by contemporaneous evidence in the form of text messages between the parties, which, taken at its highest, also tends to demonstrate that the mother failed to comply with her obligations pursuant to the orders. (c) although the father is self-represented and the documents prepared by him are not prepared in the exact manner that would be expected had they been prepared by a legal representative, the evidence adduced by the father, in conjunction with the counts as pleaded in the contravention application, set out with sufficient clarity and precision to the respondent the allegation made by the father and the case which she is required to meet, such that no prejudice to the respondent arises.   the evidence adduced by the father with respect to these remaining counts is supported by contemporaneous evidence in the form of text messages between the parties, which, taken at its highest, also tends to demonstrate that the mother failed to comply with her obligations pursuant to the orders.
