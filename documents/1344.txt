at the contested plea hearing in court no. [...] scheduled [in early] 2024, in which she is a party.
where one party to litigation is compelled, either by reason of a rule of court, or by reason of a specific order of the court, or otherwise, to disclose documents or information, the party obtaining the disclosure cannot, without the leave of the court, use it for any purpose other than that for which it was given unless it is received into evidence. the plurality in hearne v street explained, at [97] and [102], that while the obligation has been described as an “implied undertaking”, the use of the word “undertaking” is misleading, since the obligation is one of substantive law arising from the circumstances in which the material was generated.
