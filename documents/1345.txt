the father’s position
...the right way to do things, such as catching, kicking. we do fun little drills and i will be helping out this year and hope that my children will be enrolled.[8]
...always envisaged that when i had children, i would be at their events supporting them like my parents were for me. i have great memories and such a great relationship with my parents and grandparents because of it. i knew i was always loved and supported. i fear that my children will miss out on this experience if i am not allowed to be there and this is something i do not want for them.[9]

child impact report dated 6 september 2023
children are exquisitely attuned to the feelings of their ‘primary focus’ parent irrespective of whether or not these are verbally expressed. [ms ragusa] conveyed palpable feelings of anxiety, mistrust and fear in respect of [mr danvers]. she also conveyed she his highly protective of the children. this is to some extent understandable given their (the children’s) respective anxiety based and developmental changes but major note her general disposition and/or her unresolved feelings/experiences from her and [mr danvers]’ relationship.[34]
...it is unlikely [ms ragusa] will be able to engage with [mr danvers] in a more cooperative, collaborative and information sharing manner until she resolves her feelings/experiences in respect of him. however, [mr danvers] may also be required to develop a greater understanding/awareness of [ms ragusa]’s experiences during their relationship so as to better understand her responses (then and now) and engage more sensitively/constructively with her in the future.[36]
legal principles  the benefit to the child having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (2) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.[41]   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.[41]  any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views, the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and any other persons the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child and to spend time with the child and to communicate with the child, the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents or any other child or other person with whom he or she has been living, the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with the parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs, the maturity sex lifestyle and background of the child in either of the child’s parents and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant, the attitude to the child, and the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents, any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family, whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child,
injunctions sought by the mother
conclusion  the parties co-parenting relationship remains fragile following the recent making of final consent orders. i consider that the children and the parties will benefit from a period of time for the orders to ‘bed down’ before any further changes are contemplated, (2) it is unrealistic to think that making an order permitting enrolment in sports unilaterally by one parent won’t potentially have a possible negative effect on the other parent and their household. if the children love playing a particular sport when with the father there is the potential for knock on consequences in the mother’s home. it is agreed that the mother does not drive, relies on her mother for transport and currently the parties are restrained from attending at each other’s homes. how attendance at future sports matches is to be facilitated requires careful management to ensure that it does not become a point of contention between the parents which could also embroil the children, (3) the children are still very young and have many more years ahead of them to enjoy sporting pursuits with the involvement of their parents, and (4) whilst the father may see the recent sports club inquiry as benign, it reinforced the mother’s point that the father is keen to get the children involved in sport and activities and that he will do so without reference to her. it may also set up expectations for the children which the mother simply cannot uphold.   it is unrealistic to think that making an order permitting enrolment in sports unilaterally by one parent won’t potentially have a possible negative effect on the other parent and their household. if the children love playing a particular sport when with the father there is the potential for knock on consequences in the mother’s home. it is agreed that the mother does not drive, relies on her mother for transport and currently the parties are restrained from attending at each other’s homes. how attendance at future sports matches is to be facilitated requires careful management to ensure that it does not become a point of contention between the parents which could also embroil the children, (3) the children are still very young and have many more years ahead of them to enjoy sporting pursuits with the involvement of their parents, and (4) whilst the father may see the recent sports club inquiry as benign, it reinforced the mother’s point that the father is keen to get the children involved in sport and activities and that he will do so without reference to her. it may also set up expectations for the children which the mother simply cannot uphold.   the children are still very young and have many more years ahead of them to enjoy sporting pursuits with the involvement of their parents, and (4) whilst the father may see the recent sports club inquiry as benign, it reinforced the mother’s point that the father is keen to get the children involved in sport and activities and that he will do so without reference to her. it may also set up expectations for the children which the mother simply cannot uphold.   whilst the father may see the recent sports club inquiry as benign, it reinforced the mother’s point that the father is keen to get the children involved in sport and activities and that he will do so without reference to her. it may also set up expectations for the children which the mother simply cannot uphold.
