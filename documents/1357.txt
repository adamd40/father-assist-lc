as a general proposition an order cannot be made under s 79 requiring a party to create property where no property exists, to satisfy the order (for example by borrowing). however, it is well settled that an order can permissibly be made under s 79 which provides one party pay the other a lump sum cash amount even though property in that form does not currently exist. it is not permissible for that lump sum order to exceed identified, identifiable or quantified assets (or assets that would have existed had it not been for the actions of one of the parties) unless that inability to identify or quantify assets is brought about by a party’s non-disclosure.
