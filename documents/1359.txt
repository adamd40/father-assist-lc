principles in relation to parenting law
the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
best interests of the child
...no doubt in the majority of cases, there will be a positive benefit for the child having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent, if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
... having a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.
there is no legislative definition of “meaningful relationship” but for there to be a meaningful relationship, it must be healthy, worthwhile and advantageous to the child. (emphasis added)
and that desirability only operates when there is a chance of a meaningful relationship, which is beneficial to the child. it is not, in other words, a question of contact for contact sake. if there is a situation where contact with a parent is, on balance, likely to cause more harm to the child than good, or even is not likely to confer any benefit, then little purpose is served by this court making orders for such contact. that does not detract from the desirability of the child having a meaningful relationship, but the possibility of a meaningful relationship must first exist. (emphasis added)
issue of risk
138. the assessment of risk is a predictive exercise and while it is, naturally enough, liable to be influenced by factual findings about past events, the contemplation of risk entails the foresight of possible harm. it is an oddity to expect that the mere possibility of future harm can or should be proven as a probability, as has been implied before (potter and potter [2007] famca 350, (2007) flc 93-326 at [110], [129]). risks of harm must be heeded even if they are improbable eventualities. 139. speaking of the risk of some future occurrence is just another way of expressing the chance of it happening. the concept of chance lies along a continuum, encompassing all outcomes which lie in the range between highly probable and remotely possible, assuming the polar extremes of certainty are ignored. in the current context, the higher the chance of the children’s sexual abuse, the greater the risk of their physical or psychological harm. at some point on the continuum the risk of such harm becomes so potent it cannot be tolerated: it is unacceptable. ... 142. as was recognised by hale lj (as her ladyship then was) in re c and b (children) (care order: future harm) [2001] 1 f.l.r 611 at [28], in child-related proceedings, a comparatively small risk of really serious harm can justify action, while even the virtual certainty of slight harm might not. it could hardly be otherwise, because no prudent adult would willingly expose a child to the risk of sexual abuse when there is an unacceptably high chance of its occurrence, even though the chance is not proven by the evidence to be probable. requiring the proof of any possible future child abuse as a probability would pervert the law as settled by the high court in m v m and malec.   it is now well established that “unacceptable risk” includes not merely physical harm but also includes an assessment of the risk of emotional harm: see a v a [1998] famca 25, (1998) flc 92-800 at 84,996, m v m (1988) 166 clr 69 at 77. (2) such an unacceptable risk can include any or all matters that compromise the safety, welfare and well-being of a child, and is examined in light of an accumulation of factors proved: see director general, department of family and community services (nsw) and the colt children [2013] nswchc 5 at [146]–[148]. (3) the components which lead to a conclusion that an unacceptable risk exists need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of “unacceptable risk” from the accumulation of factors, none or only some of which are proved to that standard: see johnson & page [2007] famca 1235, (2007) flc 93-344 at [68], endorsing and applying the principles set out in a paper prepared by the hon john fogarty am, “unacceptable risk: a return to basics” (2006) 20 australian journal of family law 249. (4) while each factor establishing risk need not be proved to the standard of s 140 of the evidence act 1995 (cth), insofar as determining whether an unacceptable risk exists involves a prediction of the future, based on findings of fact: “the confidence one will have in the prediction will be, in part, a reflection of the confidence one has in the factual findings that base the prediction”.   such an unacceptable risk can include any or all matters that compromise the safety, welfare and well-being of a child, and is examined in light of an accumulation of factors proved: see director general, department of family and community services (nsw) and the colt children [2013] nswchc 5 at [146]–[148].

the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application brought pursuant to the provisions of s 79. that approach involves four inter-related steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing. secondly, the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of ss.79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly, the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in ss.79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), (“the other factors”) including, because of s.79(4)(e), the matters referred to in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case. (citations omitted)
these three aspects echo three of the four steps or stages developed in [hickey]. adherence to those four steps is not mandatory, and the approach “merely illuminates the path to the ultimate result” (see norman & norman [2010] famcafc 66 at [60]). indeed in martin & newton [2011] famcafc 233, (2011) flc 93-490 at 86,127, it was said of the four step calculus: 305. ... [t]hat approach is not legislatively mandated, and as the full court [in hickey] said, is simply the preferred approach. this is because it will be sufficient, in most cases, to have regard to the overall justice and equity of the orders after determination of the asset pool, consideration of contributions and assessment of the relevant s75(2) matters.
the finding of not being satisfied that the plaintiff lived on a full-time basis with the deceased in the relevant period is of central importance to whether a de facto relationship existed. it should be recalled that the list of “circumstances” in section 4(2) are reminders of matters that possibly might be relevant in deciding whether two people are in a de facto relationship, but do not state its essence. the essence is to be found in the definition in section 4(1). if two people do not “live together as a couple” they do not satisfy the definition of being in a de facto relationship, regardless of what might be the situation concerning the various “circumstances” listed in section 4(2).
principles in relation to binding financial agreements and setting aside of binding financial agreements

(1c) to avoid doubt, section 90un applies in relation to the enforcement application.   a part viiiab financial agreement covered by section 90ue is binding on the parties to the agreement if, and only if, the agreement has not been terminated and has not been set aside by a court. (3) a part viiiab financial agreement ceases to be binding if, after making the agreement, the parties to the agreement marry each other. (4) a court may make such orders for the enforcement of a part viiiab financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the agreement as it thinks necessary.   a part viiiab financial agreement ceases to be binding if, after making the agreement, the parties to the agreement marry each other.

the court may make any order that it could have made under subsection (1) or (6), and (c) an order under paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.   an order under paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.   the court must not make an order under this section if the order would: (a) result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, and   result in the acquisition of property from a person otherwise than on just terms, and   be invalid because of paragraph 51(xxxi) of the constitution. for this purpose, acquisition of property and just terms have the same meanings as in paragraph 51(xxxi) of the constitution.
