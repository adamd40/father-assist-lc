overview
the final hearing
how we got here – a detailed chronology of events
the parents
the relationship:
post-separation:
the consent orders of 4 december 2018:
early 2019 – the unravelling begins:
april 2019:
the incident was captured on the security camera [ms walstrom] had installed out the front of the house. when [ms walstrom] returned home later that day, i showed her the recording and [ms walstrom] reported the incident to the police. the police attended our home and viewed the cctv footage and requested i provide a statement however i refused for fear of retaliation from [mr dupont]. the footage is still available should it be requested.
a toxic dynamic has emerged:
i have questions. how was your week? how many farts and burps did you do? how did it make you feel?
may 2019:
phone communication with the father becomes more difficult:
august / september 2019:
will only promote arguments and i’m not interested in fabricated bullshit. [7]
late 2019:
these are pretty serious friction burns. your lack of attention and explanation has been noted.
the father was not genuinely concerned about the burns. in his mind, he was simply making a point.
boxing day 2019:
“i will not allow the children to run freely within the foyer of a licensed premises so you will have to collect them in person rather than coax them to run from a distance. failure to do so will be considered breaching of orders.”
january 2020:  x told the mother that while the father was asleep, he had jumped off a chest of drawers, hitting his leg on the bedframe, (b) y, who had returned with a band-aid on his finger, told the mother that he had injured himself while trying to cut fruit with a knife at a time when the father was not supervising him, (c) y also told the mother that he had “cut my foot in the mud and had to go find dad to help”.   y, who had returned with a band-aid on his finger, told the mother that he had injured himself while trying to cut fruit with a knife at a time when the father was not supervising him, (c) y also told the mother that he had “cut my foot in the mud and had to go find dad to help”.   y also told the mother that he had “cut my foot in the mud and had to go find dad to help”.
march / april / may 2020:
father re-partners with “ms w” – more disclosures in early 2021:
the ‘wedgie’:
the april 2021 phone call:
the consent orders finally break down:
the father and the boys become estranged:
‘ab service’:
in reference to the ‘ok’ sign that [ms ad] interpreted it is in fact a punch game, where if you look at someone making that sign below their hip they get to punch you. i have attached a picture off the internet showing my search regarding this. i find this gesture troubling given that [mr dupont] has recently faced allegations of hitting the children.
child impact report:
supervised visits break down entirely:
y’s medical diagnoses:
