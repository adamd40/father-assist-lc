reasons for judgment
judge glass:
primary considerations
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both of his parents
i’m saying that if you could remove the effect on me, and you can ensure it’s a safe environment, and – and [x] is well and happy, then of course there’s positive in him playing with him, and interacting with him, and building a relationship.
the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence   ulrich] was furious, and he had that look in his eye that he just – it just, like – it’s like he transformed, and there’s just this look of naked rage, and murder in his face. it’s horrible. it’s just so frightening. he looked at [x] like that, and he just started shouting at him for hitting him.
additional considerations
any views expressed by x and any factors (such as his maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to his views
the nature of x’s relationships with each of his parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to him, to spend time with him, and to communicate with him
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain him
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances, including the likely effect on him of any separation from either of his parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom he has been living
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect x’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of x’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of x, to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
during the familiarisation visit with [n contact service] which occurred [in mid] 2022, i felt frightened, anxious and nauseous when the [n contact service] staff member [...] begun discussing where [mr ulrich] would be with [x] in the centre and where he would arrive. i did my best to conceal my feelings from [x] by distracting him with toys, however once we returned home, [x] went to read books with his grandfather, i began to feel extremely unwell, as if i was about to vomit. i went into the bathroom and began retching and hyperventilating. i experienced a panic attack and the cycle of retching and hyperventilating continued for some time. i was unable to eat lunch that day and struggled to eat normally for about five days afterwards due to the stress response and anxiety i was experiencing. [in late] 2022, three days prior to the first scheduled visit at [n contact service] i called [the service] during a five-minute break between meetings to confirm the saturday visit. immediately after this call i connected to a work meeting. as i began talking i had to stop mid-sentence as felt i was about to vomit - a reaction to the confirmation that the contact centre visit was going ahead the coming weekend. i had to excuse myself from the meeting and rush to the bathroom where i retched. i had stomach cramps that continued all day and next day, along with nausea. i was unable to work the remainder of the morning. i couldn’t eat lunch, ate three teaspoons of [food] for dinner and couldn’t manage more. i woke frequently throughout the night, disturbed by vivid nightmares. the following two days were public holidays so there was no work. the morning of [late] 2022 i was so stressed by the upcoming visit that i could only eat 1 tbsp porridge for breakfast and then a few crackers for lunch. i found it so hard to concentrate on basic tasks that it took me almost an hour to make [x]’s porridge for breakfast. i had stomach pain and nausea and was less patient than usual. at dinner i was able to eat less than [x]. [on the] morning of the visit, i was unable to eat any porridge without gagging. i had had vivid nightmares the nights prior. prior to leaving home for the supervised visit i had a panic attack and my hands were trembling. my father drove [x] and i to [n contact service] as i felt it would be unwise for me to drive and he agreed. i broke down after [x] went through to where [mr ulrich] was but held it together for [x] while he could see me. after [x] left i cried and struggled to control my breathing. after exiting the centre i had a panic attack in the car, and cried. i was unable to concentrate on anything while [x] was in [n contact service] and just sat in the car for two hours. i was so relieved to go inside to collect [x] after the visit but still feeling nauseous and was completely drained. that evening i was able to eat less dinner than [x]. the following monday i tried but was unable to work, finding myself unable to concentrate, completely depleted and feeling nauseous. i struggled to work productively the following [day], still feeling nauseous and depleted. it took approximately seven days after the visit for me to be able to eat normally and my normal appetite to resume. i have, for every single visit in 2022, 2023 and 2024, experienced the same cycle of nausea, anxiety, panic attacks, lack of appetite and inability to concentrate prior to each of the supervised visits, as well as prior to the visits which were subsequently cancelled due to [x]’s sickness [in late] 2022. i experience chest and jaw pain from the stress, along with tension headaches. i have noticed that my stress levels start increasing markedly five to six days prior to the scheduled visit and i have a constant feeling of panic and of being on the edge of a panic attack. the mornings of the visits i have diarrhoea. after leaving [x] each time i have panic attacks and am unable to do anything except for sit and wait in my car for the two-hour visit to end. this is uncharacteristic as i like to be productive however i am unable to even concentrate on reading.[24] ... on the occasion of the visit at [n contact service] [in mid] 2023 i had been asked to wait in the waiting room while [x] went through. in past occasions the supervisor would keep [mr ulrich] in the further room, which also contained the kitchen, and take [x] through to meet him there, while playing music in the waiting room so that i would not need to hear the interaction. on this occasion this protocol was not followed. [mr ulrich] was brought into the room next to me and i could hear [mr ulrich] laughing and talking to [x]. this was distressing to me and caused me to feel so physically sick that i retched in the waiting room...[25] on the occasion of the visit [in mid] 2023 at [n contact service], one of the supervisors was with [x] while [mr ulrich] was arriving via the other entrance. [ms f] was just seeing me out of the entrance i was allocated when i heard [mr ulrich]’s voice and laughter as he crossed the outdoor area into the area where [x] was. i felt so frightened and nauseated with his proximity that i began retching and hyperventilating. when the visits took place at [n contact service] and were on a saturday morning, on every occasion i was unable to work on the friday prior to the visit, or the monday following the visit, feeling unable to focus and think through the most basic tasks, and exhausted from the stress and after not being able to eat or sleep properly over the previous week. when i do resume work i am so distracted that i make frequent errors that i would not usually make, often needing to recall emails and redo work. work that would usually take my five minutes takes up to 30 minutes as i struggle with slowed cognition. around the visits i am so stressed anxious and distracted that i am forgetful, struggle to even manage one thing at once and struggle to think through even basic things such as preparing porridge when i find myself just standing in the kitchen, confused about the steps i need to follow. this happens regardless of whether i take [anxiety medication] around the visits as i have started to do recently. i typically would manage a high level of complexity and demands at work and the multiple layers of things running simultaneously, including looking after [x]. i am usually highly organised, process information rapidly and am not forgetful. my sleep worsens considerably around the visits with an intensification of nightmares, difficultly sleeping and staying asleep. since the visits have been supervised by [r contact service] and taken place on sunday mornings i have been unable to work the monday and tuesday following the visit. even when i resume work after the visits i struggle to concentrate and can’t think through anything remotely complex. this is completely at odds with how i feel outside of the visits, when i am able to manage work, while looking after [x] and enjoy meeting with friends and taking [x] on playdates. outside of the visits i enjoy food and have a normal appetite.[26] ... [x]’s head injury at [n contact service] had a very negative effect on me. it triggered memories of a past head injury i had because of [mr ulrich]’s carelessness, of [mr ulrich] banging [x] against door frames, walls and ceilings, of [mr ulrich] allowing [x] to fall off high play equipment when he was very small and of [mr ulrich] allowing [x] to walk into oncoming traffic. after the event [in mid] 2023, i was unable to work at all until the following thursday and even then i was able to do very little (worked approx. 1 hour). i felt overwhelmed, exhausted, and was unable to concentrate to even read a basic news article. i had an appointment with my psychiatrist, [dr h] and still really struggling, reached out to my psychologist [mr l] to see if i could arrange an appointment but he was travelling overseas. i felt at breaking point and was unable to concentrate on basic things – for example making frequent trips from one room to another in the house as i would forget what i was doing or forget things and then need to go back again. this doesn’t usually happen to me. i had vivid nightmares, frequent night waking and was waking in the early hours of the morning, unable to get back to sleep. i struggled to work still but tried to do administrative tasks. i remained very stressed over the weekend. when i read the email [in late] 2023 stating that [n contact service] would no longer supervise [x]’s visits with [mr ulrich] i was so distressed that i was unable to even look after [x], needing to ask my father to do so. i felt numb, unable to process thought and sat motionless. my body felt as though it was made of lead and i found myself unable to react to [x]. i found this frightening – that there was indeed a breaking point at which i was not only unable to work but even unable to care for [x]in a basic sense. my parents both supported us both, ensuring [x]’s dinner was as normal as possible and helping me through. [27]
the week commencing [late] 2023 noting that my intake interview with [r contact service] was [in late] 2023, i had unrelenting tensions headaches all week due to the stress of the visits beginning again. i was unable to relax and very tired. in [late] 2023 i needed to call [ms s] ([r contact service]) having received a message from her asking me to call to arrange the visit schedule. i woke that morning very stressed. i was less patient than usual and [x] noticed that i was not myself. at breakfast he kept saying “i want normal mummy” “i don’t like this mummy” “i want normal mummy” “normal mummy not sad”. when my father asked what was wrong i told him i had to call about the visit schedule and burst into tears. [x] immediately burst into tears and continued bursting into tears and crying for about 15 mins, saying “i want normal mummy” repeatedly. i was not crying but could not be cheery like normal and [x] could tell and kept bursting into tears and crying throughout his whole breakfast. he calmed down later playing with his toys with his grandpa while his grandpa had breakfast. after speaking to [ms g] ([r contact service]) confirming the visit [in late] 2023 and learning from [ms g] that [mr ulrich] had changed his mind and that the visit schedule was again fortnightly i was distressed and very nauseous. i was unable to continue working despite some urgent, time-sensitive work that needed completing. i called my father but he was at work and only able to talk briefly. i reached out to [mr l], my psychologist. [mr l], who had a 15-minute break between appointments, spoke to me over a video call during which i had a panic attack. [mr l] assisted me with anchoring. i found the day difficult to get through, feeling hopeless, numb and exhausted and finding it difficult to connect with [x] – something i normally have no issue with. i was unable to eat normally, gagging when i tried and had to consume meal replacement shakes. the difficulty eating and stress continued the following days with the visit taking place [in late] 2023. uncharacteristically i even forgot [one morning] that [x] was not meant to eat breakfast as he was scheduled to have an ultrasound on the recommendation of his gp to check for anything concerning as he had been complaining of pain for several weeks. i wouldn’t normally forget something like that. during the visit, [ms g] rang me part way through the visit to ask about gifts. i had been informed by [n contact service] in the past and also by [r contact service] that the supervisor would only contact me during the visit if there was an emergency. thinking that something had happened to [x] i was very distressed. i was concerned that [ms g] was calling me rather than supervising, keeping in mind that she was the only supervisor and asked her to please concentrate on [x]. i had a panic attack as soon as i hung up. when at the conclusion of the visit i politely asked her to only contact me during the visits in case of an emergency, she snapped at me in front of [x]. i said that perhaps i could provide further context around my request over the phone during the week but she appeared uninterested and left in her car. i was unable to work the following two days after the visit. despite my ongoing psychological support and putting in practice the techniques taught to me (mindfulness activities, anchoring, progressive relaxation and breathing exercises), my experience of the visits between [mr ulrich] and [x] has not improved over time. the above is but a snapshot of the effect that the visits and have on me. it is incredibly taxing, impacts upon my work, is wearing me down considerably and is having a significantly negative impact upon my parenting capacity. i cannot continue this way indefinitely without reaching breaking point. my level of distress and anxiety regarding supervised visits is such that i now cannot communicate directly with the supervision service and have requested that my lawyer undertake all the necessary communications on my behalf prior to each visit. seeing emails from the supervisors in my inbox and text messages on my phone causes me distress and anxiety and i am unable to cope with communicating directly with them.[28] ... during my appointment with her [in late] 2023 [dr h] recommended i take [anxiety medication] around the times of [mr ulrich]’s supervised visits with [x]. i began taking it [in late] 2023 and have taken it all of the weekends of the subsequent scheduled visits. i still find myself feeling extremely stressed and on the edge of panic, but numb, disconnected and drowsy. my brain feels foggy and it leaves me with headaches, slowed cognition and difficulty retaining new information (even a new word i am told repeatedly) for several days afterwards, along with rebound anxiety and tension. this further impacts on my capacity to work as it makes it difficult to process and retain information properly. my father has commented that i am like a “zombie” with it and it is difficult to engage with and respond to [x] as i usually would. even after the [medication] is wearing off i find myself zoning out when [x] is talking to me and struggle even to concentrate on what he is saying. i am unable to think through basic games with him. the effect of the [medication] appears to be waning over time and i need to take larger doses in order to feel an effect. i do not wish to be required to take [medication] indefinitely and indeed, it is not medically recommended that i do so. after [x]’s second visit refusal [in late] 2023, i had a panic attack after returning home. my father played with [x] until naptime. my mother was away that day and when dinner time came around and i felt incapable of even thinking through what to cook for dinner. my father took [x] and out for dinner instead. following the attempted visit i was unable to work until friday the following week, taking four days off work and when i did work on the friday a colleague reached out to me after a meeting noticing that i was not my normal self. after [x]’s visit [in early] 2024, and anticipating that i would not be able to work the following day due to the impact on me, i scheduled a fun outing with [x] to the school holiday programme offered by the local [sports] centre january 2024. i was unable to take [x] as i mentally could not cope with preparing him to leave the house and felt unable to drive safely with him. the effect of the visits is such that it impacts on my capacity to parent [x] as i usually would. [x] and i are very close and he is a perceptive child, making him attune to the impact of the visits on me. despite my best efforts to manage it and engagement in therapy, the acute stress caused by the visits result in me being less patient, overwhelmed and struggling to handle even basic tasks such as preparing food. [x] commented to me, shortly after his head injury at [n contact service] [in mid] 2023, that i hadn’t been “so kind a mummy the last few days”. [x]’s care is always at the forefront for me and i am profoundly saddened that there be any impact upon him.[29]   ulrich]’s thrice weekly video calls with [x] continue to cause distress to me as hearing [mr ulrich]’s voice and having to look at the screen albeit briefly to check that he is visible to [x], triggers traumatic memories, flashbacks and fear. without fail, i wake the morning of the video calls (monday, wednesday, friday) with a lump in my stomach and a sense of dread. i feel increasingly tense over the day in the lead up to the calls. i am very distressed at [mr ulrich] hearing me on the calls and there have been either zoom or [p centre] errors on several occasions resulting in [mr ulrich] being in the call when they told me he wasn’t. despite my requests for [mr ulrich] to cease contacting me on my work phone, he continued to do so for a long period, and has provided my number to services as my contact number without my consent. i have had to establish a separate email address and phone number to avoid seeing [mr ulrich]'s name on my work devices in order to avoid being triggered throughout the day. until [p centre’s] supervision commenced in [mid] 2023, [mr ulrich] also continued to address me directly during the facetime calls with [x] causing me a significant amount of distress.[30]

my current application is not because i don’t think that there’s a benefit to [x] knowing his father. my current application is simply based on the fact that i am so worried about the effect that it’s having on me and then the – that effect on [x]. i’ve found it a really hard application to make. i grappled with it a lot. there’s a lot of guilt in knowing that [x] might not even have the supervised time because i haven’t managed to deal with it. and i have tried so hard for the last two years to deal with it. and i’m someone who believes strongly in people overcoming – sorry – who believes strongly in people overcoming and moving beyond things and quite frankly i feel stupid that i can’t because, yes, i believe that [x] would benefit from having a relationship with his father if he could be safe while doing so. and that’s why i’ve tried to make it work and i really have. sorry. i’m talking for a long time but in short, yes, if he can be safe while he’s doing so and not have the same harms or other harms that i came to. ... and even supervised, i don’t know what else i can do other than leave my job so i can manage it, but then i can’t meet my debts. ... it’s very difficult in terms of medication i can take. i’m trying that with [anxiety medication]. the thing is it doesn’t – i’m not functional without it and i’m not functional with it. and even looking after [x], you know, i’m – i’m – i’m not – i’m not a low functioning individual normally. i normally manage to handle a lot of things and juggle work and juggle him and i do well at my job normally. but i – i – i can’t with the effect of the visits. .... i feel like i’m failing miserably which just doesn’t sit well with my character, to be honest, because i’m not managing.
any family violence involving x or a member of his family
counsel for [mr ulrich]: you do understand, don’t you, a number of – digging through all the records, it has been suggested that you tend to exaggerate things that have happened to you in the relationship? [ms gavare]: i haven’t exaggerated anything that has happened to me. counsel for [mr ulrich]: you do understand that some people have suggested you may have? some medicals, yes? [ms gavare]: can i ask who? who are you referring to? counsel for [mr ulrich]: i think [dr h] even reckoned – passed on one of those, but i’m going to go through. i’m putting a point to you that you have exaggerated at times, and due to your condition at any particular time leads to a sense of distortion of the facts? [ms gavare]: i disagree that i have exaggerated anything.
although it is possible that [ms gavare] has manufactured her symptoms completely, there is not enough evidence to corroborate this suggestion. it is possible that she had mis-perceived the level of threat by the father, and had not accounted for her capacity to set enforceable limits to his behaviour. her beliefs about the level of threat may have been shaped by her affective responses in the relationship. the father’s assault on the maternal grandfather would have greatly alarmed her, and is an indicator that the father had indeed be violent.[40]
it’s something that, of course, i’ve considered in our early engagements, although my client has given me no reason to suspect that this would be the case.... i don’t have any evidence from our engagement to suggest that that’s what has taken place, your honour.
in the months that followed, a pattern emerged in my relationship with [mr ulrich], and he slowly but gradually began to erode my sense of self, my confidence and my identity. [mr ulrich] would go through periods of lavish affection – frequent complements and encouragement – and then instantaneously and with no warning, become furious and aggressive. he would frighten me with threats, hitting things in anger and chipped away at my self-esteem through demeaning name calling. he became increasingly controlling, trying to change me into some idealized version of a “[church]” wife. this attempted transformation included the clothes that i wore, the way that i spoke, the views i could hold, who i should be friends with, where i should work, and my volunteering at [church]. [mr ulrich]’s constant criticism and reproaches, juxtaposed with the declarations of love, confused me and wore away at my confidence and identity. i developed a strange dependence on him – transformed from being an independent and confident young woman to feeling that i couldn’t live without him, despite the damage that he was doing to me. at this time, i had little experience of relationships and was confused as to the way i was being treated.[45] ... from very early in the relationship and then on an ongoing basis, [mr ulrich] told me frequently that others at [church] did not approve of me, that they thought i was "crazy" and that he should not be with me. he would tell me that his love for me was therefore so pure and great – that despite me being a “chronic depressive” he was still with me. this made me feel as though i could not tell anyone what was happening in our relationship out of fear that they would not believe me. [mr ulrich] would often tell me that the lead pastors of [church in city q] (who were husband and wife), felt this way about me, destroying any possibility that i would turn to them for help. seeking clarity, i reconnected with them after our separation and found that this could not be further from the truth. in the second half of 2011, [mr ulrich] was frustrated with me and threatened that if i did not "behave" that he would call emergency services and get them to lock me up in a psychiatric hospital. [mr ulrich] would repeat this threat if i did not comply with his demands on numerous occasions throughout our relationship until the end of 2021.[46] .... [mr ulrich] set himself early in the relationship as the “saviour” who was “helping” his “weak” and “mentally ill” partner. he successfully controlled the narrative with my family and others at church this way. the distance from my parents made it impossible for them to detect what was really happening. [mr ulrich] constantly convinced me that i was an “oversensitive” “chronic depressive”, downplaying his abuse and threats, convincing me that i had imagined things and leaving me confused. i was very frightened when he would threaten to have me interned in a psychiatric hospital as i was away from my family, and i believed that he could. regardless of how much i did however, and how much i tried to please and appease [mr ulrich], the outbursts continued. i was frequently made to sit and listen to long lectures (approx.1-2 hours) by him including a play-by-play of everything i had said or done wrong, or in the wrong tone, after church events or after spending time with others. [mr ulrich] would make lists on his phone or tablet and then force me to sit and listen while he angrily listed off things that were "wrong" with me. i had to sit meekly and accept everything he said, or he would explode and begin shouting at me and hitting things near me. i was also required to apologise and detail how i would “change” in response. if i did this in slightly the wrong way or didn’t make exactly the right promise he was seeking (and i had to guess what that was) he would explode at me, which was frightening.[47] ... early in our relationship he began blaming me that he wouldn’t receive social invitations. he frequently reproached me for not being friends with the female partners of those he wanted to be his friends, and following most social gatherings or church meetings would criticize things that i said or the way that i said them. [mr ulrich] would often blame me that his “friends” were evidently avoiding seeing him. [mr ulrich] frequently pressured me to leave my job and pursue employment at [the church] as he thought that would benefit his career. with the benefit of hindsight, i appreciate this was an attempt to further isolate and control me. the volunteering requirements imposed by [mr ulrich] and his determinations on who was an appropriate friend left little space for my previous friendships, though i tried to maintain these. i never dared share [mr ulrich]’s behaviour – fearful that it would get back to him and doubtful that anyone would believe me. my previously frequent visits to the uk reduced in frequency and length – [mr ulrich] always wanted us to be together and increasingly complained about my family and/or the activities when we did go. it became easier to simply not go. [mr ulrich] kept me isolated from my family and increasingly throughout our relationship isolated me from my friends. this was particularly so where he was not friends with the same people and he insisted that we needed to be friends with couples, together. [mr ulrich] was very possessive and controlling of me. on one occasion he made me cease contact with a close male friend i had met while studying as when [mr ulrich] met him for the first time [mr ulrich] did not like the way he talked to me... prior to my relationship with [mr ulrich], and since i was around 16 years old, i enjoyed going [out] with friends. after [mr ulrich] and i began dating, he would no longer permit me to go [out] with my friends as he did not like [socialising] and did not want me [socialising] with other men. in [mid] 2012 at [mr ulrich]’s parents’ house in [country b], [mr ulrich] was screaming at me so loudly that his older brother [mr d] came upstairs, hearing him shouting and concerned what he might do. [mr ulrich] stormed out and his brother told me that i had better keep my distance. i was trembling, crying, and frightened, as i often was when [mr ulrich] yelled at me. [mr ulrich] is much bigger than me [...] he is quite tall and broadly built and physically intimidating.[48] ... after my separation from [mr ulrich], i found a diary entry dated [early] 2014 in which i had written the following. “scared to leave [mr ulrich] but scared to stay here. unhappy for 3 years?”. feel like all my energy goes into just surviving and not breaking. i want to flourish not survive. no good for me or for others just surviving. no confidence left...”. in another entry dated [early] 2014 i wrote “i live in fear of telling him [mr ulrich] things because i don’t know what his reaction will be – if it will be gentle or if it will be abusive or threatening. i always seem to be wrong. scared to say my opinion in case he explodes or leaves me... i don’t feel safe.” i recall that around this time i was questioning whether or not i should continue in my relationship with [mr ulrich]. when he realised this, he exploded at me in anger, shouting that i had better hurry up and decide. from memory, he accorded me approximately one week to “decide”.[49]
following our wedding we went on a honeymoon trip [...] for approximately [10] days. i became aware during this trip that my assumption that [mr ulrich] would change his behaviour after marriage was wrong. even during our honeymoon, [mr ulrich] would explode in terrifying rages, shouting at me. he would at other times be the picture of a “smitten” groom. it was frightening, confusing and i felt alone and unsafe. what had become a pattern continued – he would convince me that it was my fault that he had been shouting abuse at me, calling me names, losing his temper. he would downplay everything he had done and said, tell me it was normal, that he was “[from country b]”. he would lecture me at length, usually reading from a list he had noted in his phone or on a tablet, about all that was wrong with me. i would be forced to apologise and he would become “prince charming” again until made a slight misstep of some kind and the cycle repeated again.[50] ... once we were married and living together, [mr ulrich] had even greater control. when he was in rages, there was nowhere that i could go. [mr ulrich] continued to insist that we needed to be friends with couples, together. he would convince me that my family did not care about me and that they only cared for my younger sister. he increasingly sought to control the relationship with my parents. for example, after shouting abuse at me and terrifying me to the point of breaking, he would ring my father and tell him i was not doing well and that he had no idea why. i believe he did this to control the narrative of what was occurring. throughout our marriage, [mr ulrich] used our shared christian faith to prevent me from leaving him and said that a christian could not leave for that reason and that they had to show “grace” and stay in the marriage. this was another reason i felt forced to stay in the relationship. early on in our marriage, and then throughout, i experienced pain on many occasions during sexual intercourse with [mr ulrich]. he convinced me that any pain during sexual intercourse was because i "had a problem" and that "i had to get it fixed". he pushed me into sessions with a sex “physiotherapist” in [city q] that were humiliating, degrading and painful. after each session he asked me for a compete run-down of what had been discussed and done which i found humiliating and shameful. [mr ulrich] made threats and used anger to coerce me into increased sexual contact and intercourse. he would go into frequent rages, screaming at me and then, later, convince me that it was my fault because i was not touching or desiring him enough, or that i was not having sex with him often enough. this made me feel fearful and sick to my stomach as i felt i had no choice but to spontaneously touch [mr ulrich], pose for him in ways i found degrading while he masturbated and initiate sexual contact, knowing that if i did not do it frequently enough, he would begin shouting at me, belittling me, and threatening me. while sexual intercourse was frequently painful, i had to try and mask the pain and force signs of pleasure to reassure him that he was performing or risk later punishment through rages, threats and lectures. i continue to have nightmares and flashbacks as to these incidents. they are so traumatic to me that i cannot contemplate entering into another relationship, or even read or watch anything that has slight romantic content as it beings back traumatic memories of our sexual relationship.[51] ... in [mid] 2015, whilst in [city q], [mr ulrich] found out that i had renewed my british passport without changing my surname to his and without his permission, and became enraged, shouting at me that i did not respect him or love his family enough. around this time [mr ulrich]’s mother asked me if i was changing my surname, and i had said that i wanted to keep my family name. when [mr ulrich] found out his was angry. he forbade me, even later in the marriage, from correcting his mother or other members of his family when they would call me by his surname. i was constantly required to praise and flatter [mr ulrich] otherwise he would shout at me, then blame me for his rage saying it was because i did not praise him or show him enough sexual desire. [mr ulrich] would force me to listen to lectures of one and a half to two hours in length from him about how i should be encouraging, complementing, and touching him more. he would make lists of all of the things that were wrong with me. whenever [mr ulrich] was angry, lecturing me or when we were "discussing" matters, he would barely allow me to speak. he would speak increasingly loudly, shouting over me. he would require me to nod and apologise profusely for anything he was angry at me about, and if i failed to do so (or did not apologise exactly “right”), his rage and threats would escalate. this was terrifying and i am concerned that [mr ulrich] will behave in exactly the same manner to [x].[52]
when he came to visit he would frequently belittle me and shout at me. he would accuse me of being superior to him and not including him. he would be particularly angry if we did not have sexual intercourse when he visited and if i did not actively talk him up in front of everyone i introduced him to.[53]   ulrich]’s threats, bullying, insults and uncontrollable rage worsened and increased in frequency during my pregnancy and even more so following [x]’s birth. my mental health deteriorated during pregnancy with [mr ulrich] frequently exploding at me and with me having growing concerns about protecting our unborn child from his abuse and feeling vulnerable myself. in or around the third trimester of my pregnancy [mr ulrich] had been shouting and insulting me. i reached out to my midwife directly asking if i could be admitted to the maternity ward at the [hospital] for the night. i recall being too scared to tell the midwife the reason why i wanted to be admitted.[54] ... following [x]’s birth, i had less energy and time to attend to [mr ulrich]’s demands and his behaviour worsened. in or around [mid] 2020 at our home in [suburb o], new south wales, [mr ulrich] had been yelling at me and told me he "wanted to bash me up". this occurred in front of [x] who was at that stage [an infant].[55] .... on a saturday in [early] 2021 [...] [mr ulrich] yelled at me in the car in front of [x] who was [8] months old at the time and [x] began crying. [mr ulrich] shouted at me that i was a “selfish princess”, amongst other things, as he was angry that i did not want to apply for an apartment we had visited. i was shaking, afraid of him and worried about the effect on [x]. after shouting at me for a while, [mr ulrich] stormed off out of the car, leaving me to wait with [x] in the car on our own and i had no idea where he had gone. [mr ulrich] had the car keys, and i couldn’t leave the car unlocked with [x]. i had no idea what to do, where [mr ulrich] had gone and when he would be back. when he returned, he sat in the front of the car, seething with rage and gave me the silent treatment for approximately 20 minutes before we were allowed to drive home. on many more occasions [mr ulrich] gave me the silent treatment. on one occasion in 2021, [mr ulrich] ignored me and barely responded to me for more than a week, because i had not grovelled in apologies or made enough promises to change what he told me was wrong with me. i did not have the energy or time to provide the same level of constant praise, attention and sexual contact to [mr ulrich] that he demanded, given my caring responsibilities for [x] and this made his behaviour towards me worsen. even as [x] got older and was consequently more aware, [mr ulrich] would grab me sexually in front of him, grabbing my private areas and would become agitated if i did not act as if i enjoyed it. when this occurred, i would attempt to move away without angering him and distract [x]’s attention towards something else. at times, [mr ulrich] would feel me up whilst i was sleeping and grope parts of my body, waking me up.[56] ... [mr ulrich] has proven to me to be very impulsive and has also taken [x] in the past to punish me when angry with me. he is extremely vindictive, and i continue to fear that he will attempt to abduct [x] in order to punish me for separating from him. in or around [early] 2021, [mr ulrich] was angry with me and disappeared with [x]. he would not tell me where they had gone because he was angry with me and wanted to punish me, ignoring my telephone calls. [x] was only [an infant] at the time. [mr ulrich] finally answered and refused to tell me where he had taken [x] and hung up the phone. he did this on several more calls, answering and then refusing to say where he had taken [x]. i almost reached the point of calling the police however [mr ulrich] finally told me where he had taken [x]. [x] and i had not been separated for more than one hour at that time.[57]
...we were driving from our apartment to the beach and [mr ulrich] began yelling at me. [x] was crying loudly, very distressed, as [mr ulrich] screamed at me in the car. i was trembling with fear and trying to cover [x]’s ears and protect him. when we arrived, [mr ulrich] got out of the car, and walked off with [x]. i followed at a short distance, worried about [x] being with [mr ulrich] when he was in such a state. [mr ulrich] stopped and walked back to me a number of times to hiss the same insults at me right up in my face, from his greater height and just over [x]’s head, who he was carrying in a front baby carrier. that evening, he forced me to sit for one and a half hours, not allowing me to go to bed when i was exhausted, while he listed off everything that was wrong with me. he had spent two to three hours sitting on the couch making the list after we returned home while i took care of [x], who was also in the living room.[58]
...at our home in [suburb o], [mr ulrich] was yelling at me in front of [x], following me around the apartment as i tried to move away from him. he ignored me asking him to stop, moving to within 30 cm of me so that i could not avoid him and speaking loudly in my face. [x] was crying, upset by the aggression, noise, and seeing me distressed. i felt trapped and unable to get away from [mr ulrich] and had a panic attack. i called my parents for help on video call to make him stop. there were many times in the months preceding this that he had done this, always in front of [x]. after this event, i had a severe reaction and i was unable to work for weeks, having ongoing anxiety attacks and nightmares attributed to his behaviour.[59]   ulrich] is extremely sensitive to criticism and explodes in anger when criticised. whenever i attempted to carefully voice concerns about [x]’s safety when he was, for example, throwing [x] so high he would hit his head on the ceiling, [mr ulrich] would explode at me and begin insulting me. i eventually became too frightened to say anything at all. it was much easier to simply agree with [mr ulrich] outwardly. i became terrified at the thought that [mr ulrich] would intentionally or recklessly harm [x], but i was unable to say anything.[60]
i think it was really twisted because to terrify me to the point that i was in that state and then that i would have to grovel and apologise and make him happy again and flatter him and – and then he would be on – so nice and kind and – and then it would start again. and if you call that part of being nice and kind after i’ve grovelled for the fact that he has been horrible to me, that i – i don’t – i struggle to see it as support. it was really twisted. and then it was like this thing where he – he – he – he would break me and then – and then i would be all submissive and apologise and tell him how wonderful he was and how kind and then he would be mr kind and supportive and, [say] “look, you know, i’m just helping you, you know. i’m telling you all these things to make you better”. and then i would believe him and then he – he would tell the same story to other people and so if that’s what you mean by supportive, looking at it now, no. i think it was really twisted. i’m sorry. i don’t know how to answer that in a clearer way and it was very confusing.
... in our apartment in [city q], [mr ulrich] was in a rage, yelling at me and threw what he thought was my favourite cup onto the tiled floor causing it to smash, cutting and scarring my foot. [mr ulrich] had been complaining about his boss daily and in the conversation that preceded the cup throwing, and i had simply suggested he talk to another senior member of his staff, or his boss directly if he felt there was an issue. [mr ulrich] flew into a fury at this simple suggestion. the apartment was only [small], making it even more frightening as there was nowhere to move away from [mr ulrich]. i felt completely trapped.[69]   ulrich] shouted at me and then smashed a painting that was precious to me less than a metre from [x] who was in my arms and had started crying when [mr ulrich] began shouting. i was terrified and trembling. i felt very vulnerable and frightened that he would do something that would hurt [x].[74]
at or about the time that [x] was at least 12 months old, [mr ulrich] did something that hurt me physically. i cannot recall the details as i have blocked many of the more traumatic incidents, but i do remember [x] looking directly at [mr ulrich] and screaming in what seemed like rage and acute distress. [x] then came straight to me and into my arms. i can vividly remember [x]’s reaction as it was so extreme given how young he was.[77]
i accept her evidence.
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of his family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility
conclusions
x’s time with his father
the mother to follow the recommendations of [dr k] and her treating psychiatrist and psychologist are to be provided with a copy of his report and for the purposes of same, as soon as practicable, engage with a psychologist specialising in trauma and see them on a weekly basis face to face, and to engage with a psychiatrist on a weekly basis face to face.[94]
i would hope for an improvement. i’m not quite sure that i can say i anticipate it. in most cases improvement does occur over time. it’s not invariable, but i would say it’s often enough, and i think that there’s enough therapeutic leverage in terms of room to move, in terms of increased frequency of sessions and pharmacotherapy that i think there would be at least a reasonable chance of success.
during my appointment with her [in late] 2023 [dr h] recommended i take [anxiety medication] around the times of [mr ulrich]’s supervised visits with [x]. i began taking it [in late] 2023 and have taken it all of the weekends of the subsequent scheduled visits. i still find myself feeling extremely stressed and on the edge of panic, but numb, disconnected and drowsy. my brain feels foggy and it leaves me with headaches, slowed cognition and difficulty retaining new information (even a new word i am told repeatedly) for several days afterwards, along with rebound anxiety and tension. this further impacts on my capacity to work as it makes it difficult to process and retain information properly. my father has commented that i am like a “zombie” with it and it is difficult to engage with and respond to [x] as i usually would. even after the [medication] is wearing off i find myself zoning out when [x] is talking to me and struggle even to concentrate on what he is saying. i am unable to think through basic games with him. the effect of the [medication] appears to be waning over time and i need to take larger doses in order to feel an effect. i do not wish to be required to take [medication] indefinitely and indeed, it is not medically recommended that i do so.[100]
it has been my experience and been my opinion that less frequency appears to be more helpful for my client in terms of her symptomology, certainly.
it’s hard to say. i mean, she may become more sensitised with a big gap in visits. then again, she may find reassurance. i think that’s a discussion that has to be had with [ms gavare] herself.
