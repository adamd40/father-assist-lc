hi [mr briggs], it’s my birthday [soon] and i’m trying to plan my weekend. will you let the boys spend [the day] with me? thanks.[11]
hi [ms briggs], i didn’t realise it was your birthday, i’ve already got plans for the boys and i this weekend.[12]
telephone contraventions[19]
counsel for the mother: all right. we know because it’s in evidence that even in response to this contravention application, the mother says to you through solicitors on record you can contact the boys at any time, right. now, if that’s the case – if it is the case that you don’t receive a telephone call on the nominated day in the nominated time, why don’t you just simply ring the boys and have a conversation? the father: why don’t i? counsel for the mother: yes? the father: because i’m expecting a call between 6:30 and 7:30. counsel for the mother: yes. that might be the case. let’s just say for theoretical purposes, by 7:30, again, hasn’t happened. and you might think – you might think, given it’s been an issue – maybe, maybe mum is at work. do you think that? the father: i also think that --- counsel for the mother: do you think that? the father: no i don’t think that. counsel for the mother: so it doesn’t enter your head that if the phone call hasn’t occurred, given that this has been an issue where you’ve been told the phone is in the locker since [mid] 2022, she tells you she works, you know she works, she might not have the phone available – it doesn’t enter your head to think she might be at work. is that right? the father: even if she is at work --- counsel for the mother: no. does it not enter your head? the father: no, it doesn’t.[22]
