the court further orders:
reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
for the sake of the children, the best solution is for me and the children to move back into the family home and for the respondent, who is a single man, to find his own accommodation elsewhere. to this end, i am willing to pay him a reasonable amount which takes into account my contributions during the marriage and the fact that i have the ongoing care and control of the children.[8]
evidentiary considerations
on 31/7/2018, i left the matrimonial home with the children, after [mr osman] hounded me and the children to move out of the house with daily threats of violence. often i had to sleep in my car or barricade myself in my children’s room for fear of being verbally and physically abused.[11]
background
in 2007, i decided to close the joint children’s account because the respondent was withdrawing money from it, without my knowledge and spending it on alcohol and gambling.[13]
whether i was employed or not, i paid for almost of the groceries from my savings or from centrelink payments. during our marriage, the respondent never paid for groceries. i continue to do so.[14] i haven not known the respondent to pay for necessities for the children, although there may have been the odd occasion.[15]
when i received my tax refund each year, which was usually relatively significant as we had five children, she would transfer the refund payment into her sole account as soon as it would land in our joint account. in about 2008 i checked our joint savings account and saw that it was completely empty. i could see from the transactions that [ms gezim] had transferred the whole balance into her sole account. i confronted [ms gezim] about this and asked why she had transferred all of our savings. she became very angry and refused to explain. for fear of losing our marriage i did not push the issue. in 2009 we were living in rental accommodation and the homeowner decided to sell the property. [ms gezim] and i considered that we should attempt to buy our own property rather than obtaining another rental. i discussed with [ms gezim] that the deposit would need to come from the money she had stored in her sole account as we had no savings left in our joint savings account after the transfer she made and all of my wage was being applied to bills and living expenses. [ms gezim] agreed and paid the deposit of $23,030.00 from her sole account, although this was technically joint funds.[16]
the child impact report
looking forward, [x] spoke about commencing to spend time with her father, she said saturday for the “whole day” would be ok to start with. [x] was not averse to sleeping at her father’s home in the future. .... looking forward [y] could see herself spending time with her father on a saturday, she thought this would be “exciting”. when asked if she had three wishes what would they be, [y] wished her family “had better relationships with more talking and a bigger house”.[18]   gezim] alleged she has been called a “prostitute” at home and in the community and shamed within their culture, she was told she “was no use” and “not a good person” she described this verbal abuse escalating at the time of separation. [ms gezim] described herself as a “group wife” where [mr osman] would disclose details about their marriage to the community and then this would cause shame for her as a result. she alleged this denigration gave no privacy to their relationship and the community believed her to be behaving disrespectfully. [ms gezim] acknowledged her religious beliefs are important to her and she attends church most weekends, she alleged that [mr osman] called her a “fanatic, idol worshipper and mad women” regarding her religion and this impacted her emotional wellbeing and sense of self during the relationship. [ms gezim] alleged financial abuse, she claimed to only have access to her own funds and if she asked [mr osman] for more money he would say “only a prostitute asks for money” causing her to rely on friends at times. [ms gezim] alleged that if there was not adequate food in the home [mr osman] “would abuse me” even when he was aware she did not have adequate funds. [ms gezim] alleged she did not receive child support from [mr osman] until 2021.[19]   osman] demonstrated limited insight into his alleged use of family violence he minimised the concerns and laughed at times when posed with an allegation such as sexual abuse. his understanding of [ms gezim] or the children’s experiences seemed limited and he found it difficult to consider how they may have been impacted by his behaviour. [mr osman] was not child focused in his proposal and considered shared care to be an appropriate solution. [mr osman] would be encouraged to consider the limited time spent with his children over the past few years and focus on reconnecting and demonstrating consistent and reliable parenting before considering such a substantial change to the parenting arrangements.[20]
shared care relies on the children having a strong relationship with both parents and a substantial co-parenting relationship given [x] and [y]’s limited relationship with their father [mr osman] over the past few years it would not be in their best interests for a shared care arrangement to be implemented at this time. [x] and [y] need to spend short periods initially with their father [mr osman] to develop a connection and build trust before moving to any overnights or substantial time spending. [x] and [y] may benefit from commencing with three hours on a saturday for four weeks before extending this to a full day to encourage a re-connection and allow [mr osman] to demonstrate he is capable of meeting their needs.[21]
the children would prefer to continue with the arrangement each saturday from 12 pm to 7 pm and do not wish to spend any more time with the father because it will disrupt their routine, which includes their usual sunday school services. the children want to continue living with the mother and see the father only on saturdays and with sleepovers at the father’s house.[22]
legal considerations property
two fundamental premises emerge from omacini and the authorities preceding it. first, ‘adding back’ is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not ‘exceptional’ justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is ‘a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct’ than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.  children’s issues  spoke warmly about how important her faith is, she loves going to church and attends twice a week. [x] spoke about how it was important that she builds a connection with god, she enjoys going on outings with her church group.[41]
i have no reason to consider that church is not equally important to y. in her oral evidence, one of the reasons ms gezim opposed an extension of the children’s time with their father was the possible disruption of their church obligations.  family violence iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family or causes the family member to be fearful.
conclusions in respect of parenting aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[47]
property issues - discussion the pool of property contributions prospective needs – section 75(2)
the weight to be attached to a child support assessment will vary with the circumstances of each case, including the amount of the assessment, the financial circumstances of the parties, the needs of the children, whether the assessment is being paid regularly, and whether it is likely that it will continue to be paid at a regular and adequate rate in the future.
