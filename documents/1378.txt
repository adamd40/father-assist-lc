[x] was casually but well presented on the day. he appeared to have some understanding of the reasons for his attendance at the interview process noting ‘i live in two homes’. [x] attends [suburb n school] and in in year 2. initially [x] indicated some reluctance to talk on his own with the report writer making comment ‘i would be lonely talking on my own’. he was encouraged by the mother to remain on his own with the report writer. [x] commented that he was happy to be referred to as either [x] or [x]. [ms janzen] described [x] as ‘kind, social, loving, caring, looks up to his older brother and sister, active’. she described [x] as experiencing literacy issues at school and that he receives specific learning assistance. she described his school as supportive and responsive to [x]’s needs. she described [x] as making progress with his learning.

[ms janzen] openly described her love and worries for [x] wanting to act in a protective manner. [ms janzen] stated that [x] can become ‘anxious, upset, fidgety, has nightmares, finds it hard to express himself’ when faced with challenges.

[ms janzen] expressed her long term concerns in relation to the shared care arrangement for [x]. she cited significant difficulties in the areas of parental communication and lack of ability to co-parent with the father. [ms janzen] described paternal responses and attendance at all [x]’s extra-curricular sporting activities as intrusive and having a negative impact upon her time with this child. [ms janzen] described both the father and parental grandmother acting in a confronting and intimidating manner with her, in particular at changeovers and other extra-curricular events. [ms janzen] described concerns in relation to the three times a week facetime contact again perceiving this as intruding upon maternal family life, expressing the view that this communication was excessive in nature and placed some stress upon the child. [ms janzen] stated that the parties were unable to negotiate and reach compromise in their communication. [ms janzen] described the personal stress this situation has on her mental health. [mr naish] stated that he is fully committed as a father, wanting to continue the shared care arrangement, the three times a week facetime communication and participating in [x]’s extra-curricular activities. [mr naish] stated that he did not accept maternal concerns or reservations in respect to a continuation of the shared care of [x]. [mr naish] acknowledged that the paternal grandmother shared a close relationship with [x] and was actively involved in this child’s life. [mr naish] further acknowledged that at times the parties experienced difficulties in the area of parental communication and decision making. he refuted maternal descriptions of him being intimidating or perpetrating family violence during the relationship. [mr naish] described [x] as enjoying and benefitting from the shared care arrangement, believing this to be this child’s preference to continue spending meaningful and significant time in the care of each parent. parental communication was identified as a major issue of contention, this situation being in place for some time. the parties acknowledged participation in mediation in the past, this apparently not achieving resolution. in person contact at time of changeover when this is required was described as stressful for each party. the mother described a preference to keep physical distance from the father and not to engage in verbal discussions with him or the paternal grandmother. the father described attempts to exchange greetings and information without success at changeovers due to maternal resistance to this taking place. both parties further described being accompanied by family members in order to provide a witness and support at time of changeovers. it appears that there have been incidents of conflict and confrontation at time of changeovers in the presence of [x]. it further appears that the parties have not attempted mediation in 2022 or 2023 in order to resolve this matter. [x] impresses as social, engaging and friendly little boy. he was able to express some of his feelings and thoughts during the interview process. [x] indicated an acceptance of the shared care arrangement citing love and a desire to spend to spend time with each parent. [x] stated that both parents were emotionally important to him and did not disclose concerns in either the maternal or paternal family homes. [x] made observation that his parents do not communicate with each other this causing him some worry with a preference expressed that this situation change. [x] did not indicate a desire to change his living arrangements at this time. it is noted that [x] is experiencing some literacy issues at school. the mother described [x] as receiving appropriate learning assistance at this current school. the father indicated that [x] may benefit from a smaller school such as a private catholic school. both parties have direct contact with [x]’s school. [x] was described as enjoying playing [sports]. both parents also attend these extra-curricular activities. there are parental differences of opinion in respect to [x]’s specific health issues with both parties attending their own gp’s. the father stated that he had independently sought specialist appointments for [x] with a skin specialist and paediatrician citing that reports had been provided to the mother. it is considered that [x] is settled and accustomed to the current parenting arrangements. parental love for this child is acknowledged and openly expressed by each parent. both parties did not identify major concerns in respect to the practical care provided to [x] whilst in the care of the other parent. each parent described a commitment to parenting this child with a desire to maintain an emotionally significant relationship with him. the father maintained his belief that [x] benefits from the current shared care arrangement not accepting that changes were indicated. the mother continues to express substantial reservation in continuing the shared care arrangement preferring a change to primary care and parental responsibility. [ms janzen] indicated that if boundaries in respect to paternal involvement during her care of [x], that she may consider a continuation of shared care. on balance, it is considered that a substantial change in [x]’s living arrangements at this time would most likely cause this child confusion and upset. taken from this child’s point of view, shared parental care is accepted and welcomed. a major identified issue is the understanding and expectations both parties hold in relation to what constitutes co-parenting and effective communication and exchange of information about [x]. the exposure of [x] to incidents of parental disagreement and stress at time of changeovers will most likely be an uncomfortable and upsetting experience for this child, particularly as he is getting older and the conflict involves important people in his life. this of course is not in this child’s best interests, constitutes emotional harm and should be avoided by both parties. there is a maternal preference for a greater separation of parental care with limited involvement from the father during the time [x] is with her. this includes a reduction in facetime calls and an opportunity to attend, with other maternal family members, [x]’s extra-curricular activities without the presence of the father and paternal grandmother. it appears that focused maternal time with [x] is limited given the current frequency of paternal facetime calls and attendance at sporting events. the father appears not accepting of reducing his involvement with the child, not accepting that his frequent presence may be intrusive for the maternal family. in order to ensure the viability of the shared care arrangement, consideration may need to given to boundaries and limits in relation to parental involvement during the other parent’s time with the child. this may alleviate some of the stress being experienced by the maternal family. the transition to parallel post separation parenting is indicated in this matter rather than persisting in compromised attempts at co-parenting. parallel parenting is a method of shared parenting in which parents interact with each other as little as possible whilst maintaining their relationship with the child. this includes limiting direct contact at extra-curricular activities and at school. this approach is different to co-parenting where parents work together and are able to jointly communicate with each other with an absence of conflict. it is considered that parental individual responses are an issue causing distress this including a maternal tendency to be emotionally impacted by on-going issues in respect to contact with the father and paternal views that appear set and unyielding. it is considered that the parties may benefit from attendance at post separation counselling or a parenting orders program (available locally at [oo family services]) in order to address the identified issues of on-gong conflict and differences of opinion. this service engagement may also be provided through a private mediator or psychologist. recommendations the following recommendations are respectfully proposed for consideration in this matter. that the parties continue to have equal shared parental responsibility for [x]. that consideration be given at this time to a continuation of the current shared care arrangements. changeovers to continue to take place at the child’s school with school holiday changeovers remaining at [a fast food outlet]. encouragement is given to the parties attending on their own with the child self-transferring to the care of the other parent in a timely manner without the need for verbal communication between the parties, this avoiding the potential for voiced disagreement. that facetime communication with the other parent take place once a week at a planned time for a maximum of fifteen minutes. if [x] indicates a desire to communicate with the other parent, this to be facilitated. encouragement is given to each party to limit their attendance at the child’s extra-curricular activities during the week [x] is in the care of other parent. that consideration be given to the parties utilising a dedicated parenting app. in order to exchange information about the child only. that consideration be given to the parties attending post separation counselling in order to attempt to address identified issues in the area of parental communication and decision making. that the court may benefit from a report from [x]’s school providing information about this child’s specific learning issues and progress being made.
oral evidence of ms e
written submissions on behalf of the applicant
parenting matters the parties’ competing applications the applicant seeks sole parental responsibility for the child, [x] born [in] 2015 ("x"), and for [x] to live with her and spend time with the respondent 4 nights a fortnight during school terms, on special occasions and for half of school holiday periods. the respondent seeks equal shared parental responsibility and for [x] to live with both parents in a week-about arrangement, half of school holiday periods and on special occasions. the evidence the court ought to make findings as to credit in these proceedings, particularly in relation to the evidence of the parties. specifically, the court is invited to find that the applicant's evidence and that of her witnesses, should be accepted over that of the respondent. the applicant was cross-examined at length by counsel for the respondent and the icl. it is submitted on behalf of the applicant that giving evidence in the presence of the respondent was highly stressful and confronting for her in circumstances where she asserts that the respondent was, and continues to be, emotionally abusive and coercively controlling of her. the affidavit of [ms k], which was not challenged by cross-examination, describes the applicant as having high levels of stress and anxiety and states that the applicant doubts her own feelings and observations. where there was a disjuncture between the applicant's oral evidence and the detailed evidence in her affidavit, it is submitted the court ought to consider such disjuncture alongside the context outlined earlier in this paragraph regarding the applicant's state of mind, stress and anxiety. it is submitted that the applicant was otherwise a credible witness, who tried her best to answer questions honestly. it is submitted that the evidence of [mr d] was consistent with his affidavit material and that he was an honest witness who made appropriate concessions. the respondent was fixated on presenting himself to the court as a father who had [x]’s best interests at heart and whose decisions were child-focused, and in so doing often presented as an uncooperative and evasive witness in response to specific and narrow questions asked by the court, the applicant's counsel and the icl. the respondent only made some concessions in cross-examination when he was pressed to do so by the icl, particularly in relation to the incident [in late] 2019, the reasons why the applicant withheld [x] from him after the incident [in] 2019, and him reporting the applicant to cyps. the respondent appeared to have difficulty answering questions about the late concessions he made in relation to reducing facetime calls and attendance at extra-curricular activities. the respondent failed to make full and frank disclosure about his mental health (both to the icl in the icl questionnaire and by refusing to sign a joint letter to [dr f] for her file) and failed to provide disclosure of his post-separation parenting course certificate to the applicant when requested to do so. parental responsibility the applicant seeks sole parental responsibility for [x] for the reasons set out at paragraphs 270-274 of her affidavit filed on 13 october 2023 and pages 2-4 of her case outline. it is submitted that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility does not apply given the family violence perpetrated by the respondent. the applicant's account of the incident [in late] 2019 (as well as [mr h]’s account, which is unchallenged) accords more generally with what is in the police records and ought to be taken as the more accurate view. if the evidence of the applicant and police are accepted, the incident was a significant incident of family violence and should be treated very seriously by the court. when the respondent was asked if he disputed the applicant's allegations or the description about what occurred on the day, the respondent responded with "i took an undertaking and i believe the matter is now formally closed". when asked to answer the question by his honour, the respondent said "no i don't agree with it". when his honour asked "if it had been the case that the mother's account accords more generally with what's in the police records, would you accept that, that perhaps, might be taken to be the more accurate view?", the respondent replied "i asked for the police footage, your honour, and they were unable to provide it". it is submitted that the respondent displayed in his evidence, a lack of insight and accountability as to how his actions affected the applicant and the children, and why that may have led to the applicant withholding [x] for a period of time. this raises significant concerns about the respondent's ability to regulate his behaviour and/or understand its impact on [x] or the applicant in the future. if the court finds that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility does apply, it is submitted the presumption is rebutted by evidence that it would not be in [x]’s best interests for the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility for him. the applicant has had difficulties in negotiating and reaching agreement with the respondent about major long-term issues for [x], including which school [x] attends (paragraphs 153-162 of her affidavit) and health matters (paragraphs 97-128 of her affidavit). during cross-examination, the respondent admitted that he unilaterally withdrew [x] from [suburb n school] and enrolled him into [jj school] without the applicant’s consent. this was corroborated by the subpoenaed material from [suburb n school]. the respondent was critical of the applicant not being open to changing [x]’s school and made a request to change it [in mid] 2021, shortly after orders were made for [x] to attend [suburb n school] and despite the notation in the orders dated 28 april 2021 that the parents agreed to discuss [x]’s schooling after finalisation of their property settlement. the respondent did not concede that his proposal to change schools is an idea in its infancy despite the fact that he admitted that he cannot afford to pay for private school education, has not explored whether [x] has reading difficulties, has not reviewed naplan results for either school, and has not provided details of his proposed schools to the court. the respondent conceded he did not tell the applicant about [x]’s appointments with [an optometrist]. the respondent initially did not coherently respond when asked if he would accept that the communication/co-parenting relationship hasn't worked well over the last three years. he admitted that the majority of the time the co-parenting relationship has not worked well. it is established on the evidence that the parties have a poor communication record. when answering questions about whether the complaint to cyps made about the applicant [in late] 2020 was appropriate, the respondent said, with the wisdom of hindsight, he probably shouldn't have done it and anything he did was in [x]’s best interests. when asked how he would make long-term decisions with the applicant, the respondent said "i'm hoping that we can both set aside our differences and work together for our child". the respondent said that he believed that "there's apps online that can improve our communication. i believe there's courses. i don't feel like i've exhausted or i've done enough to – for our child. and i think if we both have a bit of reason, reasonableness from both sides, the outcome can only be for the benefit of our son – our child". the respondent has had some 4 years since separation to propose said apps, and complete said communication courses, no such attempt has been made by the respondent. this honourable court cannot have confidence that the parties will be able to agree on major-long term issues concerning [x] relying on the wishful thinking of the respondent, when the evidence before the court points to the contrary. [ms e], during cross-examination, said sole parental responsibility would not be unreasonable if the time [x] spends with the respondent is substantially reduced. her evidence was that the parties are going to struggle to make big decisions together. the court can find that the applicant will consult with the respondent about various major long-term issues as she has done so in the past, including the optometrist appointment which the respondent accepted in cross-examination, and other matters (paras 87-160 of her affidavit). section 60cc factors section 60cc(2)(a) – meaningful relationship [x] has a meaningful relationship with both parents. the focus, is both on the issue of 'benefit' in addition to the issue of 'meaningful relationship'. in godfrey & sanders, his honour said “...what the legislation aspires to is to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship". in tait & densmore, cronin j explained "an optimal relationship is one which is second to none, unmatched and unequalled. that cannot be what the legislation intended. to be a meaningful relationship, it must be healthy, worthwhile and advantageous to the child". the applicant's position is that a meaningful relationship can be achieved if [x]’s time with the respondent is reduced in accordance with her application. section 60cc(2)(b)– the need to protect the child from harm [dr f], in her 2021 report, said "[mr naish] presents with symptoms with a clinical picture consistent with a diagnosis of chronic adjustment disorder on the background of a probable personality disorder. as a result of his maladaptive personality traits, he has been unable to work through his psychological injury neither clinically nor using a rehabilitation model ... he continues to be embittered, unmotivated and preoccupied with a sense of injustice and irritable. these factors will interfere with securing and maintaining employment in any setting ... his personality appears to be characterised by an externalising attributional style. this has interfered with his ability to work in a rehabilitation paradigm. his personality is entrenched and it is unlikely to respond to rehabilitation or treatment ... psychological treatment does not appear to have resulted in significant improvement. i suspect this is not the fault of the treatment model but of [mr naish]’s underlying personality. this makes his condition treatment resistant." the applicant submits that the observations of [dr f] accord with her experience of the respondent. if the observations of [dr f], or some of them, are correct, it appears the respondent's behaviour will not change and any condition he might have cannot be treated. during cross-examination by the icl, the respondent accepted that [dr f]'s observations were accurate in 2021 and yet failed to concede that 2021 was difficult for the applicant to co-parent with him in light of these observations. this is approximately the time where the applicant says that she stopped trying to co-parent with the respondent. the respondent repeated on a number of occasions during cross-examination that he is not on medication and does not have any treatment plans. there is no evidence that the respondent sought any assistance with his mental health after he was declared permanently unable to work. it is asserted by the applicant that the respondent only participated in treatment for the purposes of ensuring that he continued to obtain [workers compensation] payments. it is submitted that the respondent's mental health, currently untreated, and his embitterment, lack of motivation and preoccupation with a sense of injustice are a risk to [x]. [x] will be exposed to, and model, these characteristics and negative attitudes, the respondent's externalising attributional style means that he is unable to accept any wrongdoing and will continue to undermine the applicant as a parent, and [x] will be exposed to the conflict between his parents and his mother's anxiety about co-parenting with the respondent. section 60cc(3)(a) – child’s views it is submitted that little weight should be given to [x]’s views outlined in the family report given his age and the nature of [x]’s relationship with the respondent. section 60cc(3)(b) – nature of the relationship with parents and other family members the evidence of the applicant and [mr h] illustrates that [x] has a close and loving relationship with the applicant and his siblings, [mr h] and [j]. the applicant raises concerns about the degree of involvement of the paternal grandmother and the respondent's reliance on her to care for [x]. it is submitted that the paternal grandmother acts as a 'pseudo-parent' to [x], rather than a grandparent, due to the respondent's incapacity. the applicant's evidence in her affidavit is that the paternal grandmother attends medical appointments for [x] and contacts [x]’s school. the respondent confirmed in oral evidence that the paternal grandmother accompanied [x] and the respondent to the meeting with the icl. section 60cc(3)(ca) – parents' obligations to maintain the child the applicant currently pays the respondent child support in the sum of $17 per week. the applicant also pays for [x]’s specialist appointments and school excursions. [in mid]-2023, the applicant requested that the respondent contact [a government authority] to update them that his income had increased. the respondent has not updated his income for the purposes of child support despite saying that he would [in] june 2023. section 60cc(3)(d) – the likely effect of any changes in [x]'s circumstances the applicant submits that a change to a substantial and significant time will have minimal adverse effects on [x] and will ultimately benefit him long term. [ms e], during cross-examination, suggested that there may be ways to alter the arrangements to reflect a substantial time arrangement and that she was "not particularly stuck on week-about". the applicant submits that four nights a fortnight with the respondent meets the definition of substantial and significant time under section 65daa of the act in circumstances where her proposal provides for [x] to spend time with the respondent on days that fall on weekends, weekdays and holidays. the respondent will still be involved in [x]’s daily routine and occasions and events that are of significance to [x] and the respondent. section 60cc(3)(f) – capacity the respondent's oral evidence supports the applicant's contention that the respondent lacks the ability to provide for [x]’s emotional needs. he was unaware that [x] may have been interviewed by cyps in response to his reports to cyps and did not consider the effect of same on [x]. the respondent's lack of insight in relation to the family violence incident in [late] 2019 outlined at paragraph 9 above is also a relevant consideration as to capacity. section 60cc(3)(k) – family violence order the family violence order taken out by the queensland police against the respondent [in late] 2019 should be given significant weight in this matter. the matter was resolved by consent and did not proceed to trial, however, the police were satisfied on the evidence before them on the day that there was a need to protect the applicant and [x] from the respondent. it is submitted that the respondent's behaviour was a serious act of family violence, and would have had a significant impact on [x] and the applicant particularly being exposed to his drinking. this was supported by [ms e] in cross-examination. [ms e], in cross-examination, said words to the effect of "it was a concerning incident", "there is no downplaying the situation" and [x] "was exposed to a highly distressing incident of family violence". it is submitted that the respondent obtaining family violence orders against the applicant and her partner was opportunistic and vexatious. when asked why the respondent made the applications, the respondent answered "it was only when i put the application on that i found out who – who the other male who's in change of conveying my son around to [sports] was, despite my previous request to ask". he displayed no insight into the impact his actions might have had on the applicant, [x] and their family. section 60cc(3)(l) – further proceedings for the reasons set out at paragraphs 8-18 above, it is preferable to make an order for sole parental responsibility in favour of the applicant as this would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to major long-term decisions. section 60cc(3)(m) – other relevant facts or circumstances it is submitted that [ms e] placed significant weight on the status quo in her report and giving her evidence and placed less weight on the family violence incident in 2019, the reports made to cyps and the applicant's high levels of stress when dealing with the respondent. property matters the parties’ competing applications after hearing the evidence and making concessions in cross-examination, the applicant seeks 40% of the net non-superannuation assets and 50% of the superannuation assets. the respondent seeks a division of 75% of the net assets excluding superannuation. the evidence the applicant's cross-examination evidence showed a person with an unsophisticated and rudimentary understanding of financial matters. her evidence was given in a cooperative and candid manner despite her naivety about certain matters. the respondent did not make full and frank disclosure of his financial circumstances and was given leave to address a number of matters during evidence-in-chief which should have been addressed in his affidavit. net asset pool the applicant contends that the asset pool is as set out in the joint balance sheet submitted to chambers on 10 november 2023. the net value of the net total assets is $3,559,769. the applicant agrees to the value ascribed to the [necklace] and [the ring] only on the basis that the respondent retains those items. otherwise, the applicant asserts that the value of those items is nil. the applicant's credit card existed during the relationship. the value at the trial is provided. addbacks the respondent, in evidence-in-chief, said that he disposed of $26,918 from his [z bank] investments after separation by paying most of it onto the home loan account for the [suburb p] property and spending around $10,000 on a rental property. the respondent has provided no evidence in support of these assertions in his filed trial material or in discovery. in part m of his financial statement, the respondent deposes to disposing of a [motor vehicle 2] and receiving $10,000 in net proceeds. in his affidavit, the respondent, at paragraph 143, deposes to applying these funds towards paying for a rental property after separation. the respondent admits at paragraph 145 of his affidavit that he expended $9,950 withdrawn from the [suburb p] property home loan, to pay his legal fees. it is submitted this amount ought to be notionally added back to the net asset pool in accordance with the full court’s decision of hdm & mm & sjm, which accepted the decision of [ajo & gro]. [in early] 2023, the respondent received $68,000 from [her employer] for the cessation of his employment, including various leave entitlements. the respondent withdrew $8,000 in cash and $60,000 by way of bank cheque the same day. the respondent asserted in cross-examination that 50% of the $69,000 was spent on legal fees and the rest was used to rehouse himself and his mother and purchase a vehicle for her. the respondent then said that he spent about $40,000 on the vehicle and $33,000 on his legal fees. the respondent has not provided any source documents showing how the $69,000 was applied. respondent’s [super fund 1] the family law value of the invalidity pension to be paid to the respondent is $1,662,892. this is a pension in the sum of $86,500.70 per annum (increasing with cpi each year) to be paid for the remainder of the respondent's life. the court can either make a splitting order in relation to the pension or not make a splitting order but take the pension into account under s 75(2) of the family law act 1975 (cth) ("the act"). the applicant's position is that the court should make a splitting order. the respondent's oral evidence was that the contribution towards his superannuation recorded in his financial statement dated 17 november 2021 was one single payment that he chose to make. the respondent agreed there was a deduction from his [workers compensation] payments to his [super fund 1], but his responses that "the [employer] didn't pay their component" and "they didn't have an obligation to do so" were incorrect and misleading. his payslips show regular contributions made to [super fund 1] by his employer whilst he was receiving [workers compensation] payments. the valuation of the respondent's [super fund 1] was $181,696.94 as at [early] 2011 and $492,247.49 at separation. the applicant indirectly contributed to the respondent's superannuation whilst they were together and that, therefore, it is appropriate for there to be a split in her favour. contributions the applicant owned a property in [suburb g] at cohabitation. the applicant agrees that the respondent owned the [suburb p], [city qq] and [suburb w] properties prior to the relationship. the respondent has not provided any evidence as to the loan balances for the properties as at the date of cohabitation. the applicant's position is that there was minimal equity. during the relationship, the [suburb p] property increased in value by $450,000 and the [suburb w] property increased in value by $292,000. the parties lived in the applicant's [suburb g] property from [late] 2011 until [late] 2013, during which the applicant paid all outgoings. in [mid] 2013, the parties purchased a block of land at [suburb y] in nsw ("the [suburb y] property") using their savings. they also obtained a loan from nab in the sum of $294,000. between [mid] 2013 and [mid] 2017, the applicant paid the loan ($461.25 per week). the applicant sold the [suburb g] property in about [late] 2013 and received net proceeds of sale of about $274,375. the applicant applied these funds to the [suburb y] property. in early 2014, the respondent sold the darwin property and received net sale proceeds of $201,292.62. the applicant agreed in cross-examination that those funds were used towards the [suburb y] property, but it is not clear how they were applied as the statement provided by the respondent shows that he received $201,292.62 but the closing balance is $100,111.47. there are also a number of cash withdrawals, bank cheques, gambling and other transactions, unrelated to construction expenses. the [suburb y] property sold for $780,000 in [late] 2017. at this time, the parties refinanced the loan secured over the [suburb p] property into joint names and applied the proceeds of about $421,939 to this loan. the applicant thereafter paid $720 per week and the respondent paid $500 to the [suburb p] loan until separation. between [late] 2017 and separation, the applicant met all of the household outgoings and expenses for the family, including the ‘parenting costs’ for the children. the applicant did most household chores, except cooking which the respondent did. when asked in cross-examination if the respondent would accept that his mental health affected his capacity in terms of chores, he said "i could have been a better – a better husband yes". the applicant's evidence at paragraphs 25-38 of her affidavit was largely unchallenged. the respondent's evidence about caring for the applicant's children is inconsistent with the initial rehabilitation assessment report dated [early] 2013 ([dr f] subpoena material), "[mr naish] has significantly withdrawn from every aspect of his social life as well as participation in household tasks which include child care" which the applicant's counsel asked the respondent about in cross-examination. in mid-2019, the applicant received an inheritance of $85,000 from her grandmother’s estate. the applicant accepted in cross-examination that the respondent received $330,000 from his father. it is difficult to identify what the funds were used for. the respondent has disclosed one bank statement with a closing balance of $251,000 and a number of withdrawals near clubs with gaming facilities, which the respondent has not particularised. annexure "x" of the respondent's affidavit asserting what he spent on [suburb y] property construction is inadmissible. the accountant is not on affidavit and there are no accompanying source documents or business records to support the accountant's figures. all of the statements annexed to the respondent's affidavit where he asserts he contributed external funds towards the [suburb y] property show a number of withdrawals and gambling transactions. the respondent during cross-examination conceded "i've gambled a lot over the years". this is a relevant issue, as the respondent asserts the funds he received were applied towards the acquisition, improvement and conservation of the properties. it is submitted that in assessing the contributions made by each party in the current proceedings, there should be a 10% adjustment to the husband. section 75(2)(a) – the age and state of health of each of the parties the applicant is 51 years of age. she is in good health. the respondent is 48 years old. in [dr f]'s report, the respondent reports that, in 2020, he was diagnosed with [a medical condition]. there is no independent evidence of this. section 75(2)(b) – the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties the applicant is employed as [a professional] on a full-time basis, earning approximately $80,000 gross per annum. the respondent is on an invalidity pension of $86,500.70 per annum (increasing with cpi each year). the costs notice filed [in] 2023 states that the applicant has paid her legal costs to date from one or more of her assets, income, savings, credit cards, gifts or loans. the respondent's costs notices were drafted in a similar fashion. the applicant's evidence was that her employer paid her fees as a gift, but she "paid filings and other things as well" and that she paid her legal fees with her previous lawyer. this gift is not connected to her employment and is akin to a friend or family member paying her fees. the respondent receives assistance from his mother to pay his legal fees and, whilst he contends it is a loan, no loan agreement has been produced. but for her employer's assistance, the applicant would be unable to afford legal representation and would have been at a disadvantage during these proceedings. unlike the respondent, the applicant has not dissipated any marital assets on legal fees that would otherwise be in the asset pool. the applicant submits that the payment of her legal fees paid by her employer was a financial resource to her during the proceedings (as was the payment of the respondent's legal fees by his mother), but is not a future financial resource. a financial resource is an asset that can be used for the purpose of generating income or a source of future financial benefit. for example, accrued periods of leave, a future pension entitlement, an anticipated inheritance or a beneficiary to a testamentary trust. in hall & hall, the court held that a financial resource must be something that you can reasonably expect will be available in the future. there is no evidence that the applicant will receive an ongoing financial benefit from her employer (other than her salary). the arrangement is limited to payment of legal fees for these proceedings and is not something the applicant can reasonably expect will be available in the future. the employer can withdraw their consent at any time. it is submitted that the significant fees incurred in this matter are a result of protracted proceedings due to the respondent's conduct. the applicant was required to file an application in a proceeding to reduce facetime calls and restrict the respondent's attendance at extra-curricular activities, which were not resolved until the commencement of trial when the respondent made concessions, which he could have made earlier. the applicant had to make numerous, repeated requests for disclosure, and issue subpoenas to obtain information not disclosed. the applicant had to instruct her lawyers to defend the family violence proceedings against her, initiated by the respondent as a self-represented litigant during the course of the substantive proceedings. the employer has not funded the family violence proceedings. the respondent's last costs notice does not appear to include legal fees incurred by previous solicitors. he deposes to his legal fees approaching $180,000 at paragraph 81 of his affidavit filed 18 october 2023, but the figure on the costs notice is $111,339.65-$121,339.65. it is not clear from the evidence how much the respondent has paid in legal fees nor how much of the parties' assets have been dissipated by him in this regard. section 75(2)(c) – whether either party has care or control of a child under the age of 18 years [x]'s care arrangements will be determined by this court. the applicant's daughter, [j] who is 16, lives with her and spends time with her father in accordance with her wishes. section 75(2)(e) – the responsibilities of either party to support any other person the applicant is responsible for the support (including financial) of [j]. section 75(2)(f) – the eligibility of either party, for a pension, allowance or benefit the respondent received an invalidity retirement certificate [in late] 2022. the respondent's pension became payable [in early] 2023 and is $86,500.70 per annum. the amount payable to the respondent for life, to the exclusion of the applicant, is $1,662,892. section 75(2)(m) - cohabiting with another person-- financial circumstances the applicant does not cohabitate with her partner, [mr d]. the respondent has not re-partnered but lives with his mother. the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation are not particularised by the respondent other than to say that [ms janzen] earns $400 a week and pays $50 a week towards [x] for recreation and treats. section 75(2)(n) – the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 79 the applicant's proposal is for the [suburb p] property to be sold. the respondent conceded in oral evidence that he would have to sell or liquidate one of the properties to fund a payment to the applicant, saying his "finance position is very seriously undermined", and has not provided evidence of his borrowing capacity despite the terms of his application. section 75(2)(na) – any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 in the event that the applicant is successful in her application for [x] to live primarily with her, the respondent will be required to pay approximately $103 per week to the applicant. section 75(2)(o) - any fact or circumstance which the court requires to be taken into account since separation, the respondent has had the sole benefit of the payments set out in paragraphs 40 to 43 above (figures underlined). if the court does not add these funds back, the applicant asserts that they should be taken into consideration under s 75(2)(o) of the act. the court should make a splitting order of the respondent's [super fund 1]to the applicant. if the order is made, the applicant will immediately be in receipt of an associate pension, which will make her income superior to that of the respondent for about 10 years. otherwise, the parties' incomes for the next 10 years, until the applicant's retirement, will be similar. thereafter, the respondent's income will be significantly superior. the respondent's father's will provides for the respondent to receive a quarter of his estate, and the respondent concedes this is a possibility. the respondent is critical of the applicant not paying the [suburb p] home loan. the applicant made superior contributions to the loan during the relationship, such that it was in credit at separation. the respondent was at liberty to make loan repayments noting he did not have mortgage repayments of his own. the respondent admitted he told the bank he did not want to contribute and asked them to take possession. in all of the circumstances a proper application of the s 75(2) factors would call for: an adjustment of 15% in favour of the applicant in the event that the addbacks she asserts are treated as financial resources, she has the primary care of [x] and the court does not decide to make a splitting order of the respondent's [super fund 1], or no adjustment in the event that the court makes a splitting order of the respondent's [super fund 1]. justice and equity a division of 40% of the net non-superannuation assets would see the applicant receiving $602,582 by way of a cash payment as well as retaining her car and cash in bank. the applicant is seeking an equalisation of the parties' superannuation entitlements including the respondent's [super fund 1] entitlements for the reasons set out above. a split of 43% of the respondent's [super fund 1] represents an equalisation of the parties' total superannuation entitlements. the applicant submits that the respondent's position, which is that the applicant receive 25% of the net assets excluding superannuation, is not just and equitable. a payment of $248,615 to the applicant (which is what the respondent proposes to pay the applicant) is less than what the applicant financially contributed to the relationship and does not appear to take into account the applicant's future needs if the respondent's invalidity pension is treated as a financial resource and if the applicant is successful in her application for [x] to live in her primary care.
written submissions on behalf of the respondent
background the parties commenced cohabitation in [late] 2011, were married [in] 2012 and separated [in late] 2019. their relationship was therefore approximately 8 years. they have one child of the relationship, [x]. the mother has 2 children from prior relationships. these children lived with the parties during their relationships. at separation there was a family violence incident involving the father and his sister. the context of the incident appears to be the relatively recent death of the paternal grandfather and a dispute between the father and his sister relating to that. nonetheless, an interim family violence order was obtained by queensland police on behalf of the mother and the children. prior to separation, the father was the main person responsible for the care of the children. he had not worked in paid employment for the whole of the parties' relationship. he was therefore available to care for the children during the day whilst the mother was at work. after separation, the mother withheld the child [x] and refused to allow the child to spend time with the father for several months. at mediation [in early] 2020 the parties agreed to a rapid progression in the child's time with the father, culminating in an equal time arrangement. this arrangement was implemented. in late 2020, the parties had a dispute about which primary school the child should attend for kindergarten. as part of the mediated agreement in [in early] 2020, the parties had agreed that the child would attend preschool at [suburb n school]. both parties took unilateral steps to try and ensure that the child attended their school of choice for the 2021 year. for the mother's part, she withheld the child and stopped all time between the child and the father between february and april 2021. in relation to property matters, the parties are generally agreed as to the factual background about the assets and liabilities that each had at the commencement of the relationship and that each received during the relationship. it is the assessment of the weight to be given to those factual matters that is not agreed. it is noted that the wife's agreement in relation to some of the monies that the husband received was only forthcoming during cross examination and had not previously been conceded. the husband has not been employed in paid employment for the whole of the parties' relationship. a workplace incident in 2011 resulted in him receiving workers compensation payments [...] for the whole of the relationship. post separation, the husband was assessed as being permanently unable to return to employment. as a result, he received a number of payments on termination of his employment and became entitled to receive superannuation entitlements. he is now in receipt of his [super fund 1] as a pension in the payment phase. this is his only source of income. credibility both parties gave evidence and were cross-examined. both parties probably had some difficulty in dealing with the cross examination arising from their respective mental health frailties. nonetheless, it is submitted that the court would have concerns about the mother’s evidence in a number of respects. she had difficulty in making any reasonable concessions, even when pressed by the court. instead, she chose to attempt to defend actions by her that were objectively inappropriate. she also had difficulty in accepting any positives about the father. the mother accepted that she had made deliberate decisions to withhold the child on 2 occasions for strategic advantage in the parenting dispute. in the first instance, the mother made the decision to withhold the child for several months after separation in order to ensure that the father could not argue that he was the primary carer for the child, despite this being the arrangement prior to separation. this modus operandi was then replicated in early 2021 when she withheld the child as a result of the dispute between the parents as to the child's school. these actions show that the mother was determined to take strategic, rather than best interests, decisions in order to advantage her position in the parenting dispute. in september 2022 the mother made an application in a proceeding for the purpose, inter alia, of reducing the frequency and duration of facetime calls. part of the suite of orders sought by the mother included specific orders about the child being provided with privacy during those calls notwithstanding that order sought by the mother, she and her partner give detailed evidence of asserted verbatim conversations between the child and the father over multiple facetime calls between them. the mother's partner [mr d], kept a journal where he recorded what he said were notes from such calls. neither the mother, nor [mr d] could concede either that their actions were hypocritical or otherwise were inappropriate. the mother also made the decision to stop paying mortgage instalments for the property where she and the children were living. as a result, she lived in the [suburb p] property rent free for almost 3 years prior to moving out. the mother agreed, in cross examination, that part of the reason for making that decision was to prioritise payment of her legal fees. it transpired that this was a lie and had to be corrected in re-examination by the mother's lawyers. for the first time, in re‑examination, the mother disclosed that her legal fees had been paid by her employer, apparently with no expectation of repayment. the mother, of course must have been fully aware that she was not meeting her legal fees and so her deception in cross examination is all the more egregious. the father had some difficulty in also making concessions but ultimately made a number of concessions against interest, especially under cross examination by the icl. it is submitted that any credibility issues would only be found in relation to the mother and not the father. parenting matters the key issues in relation to the parenting are:- parental responsibility, whether or not an equal time arrangement is in the best interests of the child, noting the various issues that the mother raises in relation to the equal time arrangement, and other s.60cc factors. parental responsibility the court is obliged to apply a presumption that equal shared parental responsibility is in the best interests of the child. that presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that there has been abuse of a child or family violence. other than the incident [in late] 2019, it is submitted that the court would not have concerns about family violence issues. the mother sets out her evidence in relation to alleged family violence from paragraphs 21 to 23 of her trial affidavit. much of the evidence in those paragraphs is vague and generalised. most of the allegations related to harsh words being exchanged between the parties during arguments. in relation to the incident [in late] 2019, there can be no doubt that this was a serious incident of family violence. the incident was not directed at the mother or the children although it is clear that they would have been frightened by the incident. the incident is a one-off incident at separation in the context of the recent death of the father's father. while this does not excuse the father's behaviour, it provides an explanation for what was, on anyone's version of the history of the relationship, an out of character incident for the father. whether the presumption applies or not, the court can still make an order for equal shared parental responsibility. the court would be particularly concerned with the mother's actions in relation to the 2 key disputes regarding issues of parental responsibility post separation. in the first instance, when the parties did not agree as to schooling, the mother withheld the child for more than 2 months to ensure that her chosen school was attended by the child. at a later time, the father became concerned about possible respiratory issues for the child and took the child to see a general. the gp diagnosed the child with asthma and prescribed appropriate medication/treatments. at this early stage, the position of the parties should have been simple. a gp had diagnosed the child with a medical condition and given advice about managing that condition. a parent should, in those circumstances follow the advice of the gp, especially when the treatment is not harmful to the child. the mother (and, extraordinarily for a non-parent, her partner) made the decision that they would not follow the advice of the gp. the mother was entitled to obtain a 2nd opinion given her disagreement with the original diagnosis. however, her actions in ignoring that diagnosis and advice from the first gp was, with respect, extraordinary. the mother has shown by her actions that she considers that the father's opinion is to be ignored and that only her opinion (or that of her current partner) are appropriate to take into account. this is likely the future for the father if the mother is granted an order for sole parental responsibility. that is, it is likely that the mother will simply ignore the father's input entirely even if she goes through the steps required by any order to consult with him. another issue arising as a result of the actions of the mother relates to the attitude of [suburb n school] to him after the implementation of the mediated agreement in april 2020. as a result of comments or information provided to the school by the mother, the school threatened to call police if he did not leave the school's premises. the court would be concerned that the mother's intention was to wholly exclude the father. it is, perhaps, not surprising that the father would be reluctant to agree to the child continuing to attend at that school. the issues requiring agreement between the parties will likely narrow as a result of agreements that have been reached between the parties. there was agreement between the parties in their respective cross examinations that the child should have a single gp who is separate from the gp practice treating either of the parties. with that agreement, the issue of the child's health should be more readily able to be resolved. in relation to schooling, the parties are agreed that they will attend mediation to discuss the child's school once the property matters have been finalised. it is necessary for the issue to be deferred until then so that each party can know where they will be living and potentially choose a school that is convenient to both of them. it is appropriate, especially given the mother's extraordinary unilateral actions previously, that the father be given an appropriate input into the decision about the child's schoo1. with orders in place to manage those 2 key issues of schooling and health, an order for shared parental responsibility should be able to be implemented. to do otherwise would be to reward the mother for her egregious behaviour in relation to decisions previously. equal time the parties have agreed to an equal time arrangement on 2 separate occasions, 12 months apart, and notwithstanding what the mother now says are her reservations about that arrangement. it is submitted that the most appropriate arrangement for the child is a continuation of the equal time arrangement. in both [early] 2020 (at mediation) and april 2021 (orders by consent) the parties agreed to an equal time arrangement. the agreements on both occasions followed the actions of the mother in stopping all time between the child and the father arising from supposed concerns about the child in the father's care. the mother has shown, by her agreement to equal time arrangements, that she does not hold genuine concerns about the child in the father's care. effectively, the mother has sought a reduction in time as a result of 2 issues about which the parties were unable to reach agreement until the helpful comments by the court at the commencement of the trial. these issues are the frequency and duration of facetime calls and the attendance by the parties at extracurricular and other activities during the child's time with the other parent. after preliminary comments by the court, the father conceded that he would no longer attend extracurricular activities for the child when the child was not in his care. orders were made by consent after the conclusion of the trial on 7 november 2023 relating to this issue. as a result of that concession, this issue should no longer be a matter of concern to the court. the frequency and duration of facetime calls was also a matter of dispute between the parties. as with the issue relating to extracurricular activities, the parties are now agreed that facetime call should only occur once per week while the child is in the other person's care and that such calls should only be for up to 15 minutes. again, the issue appears to have been resolved. it is noted, in relation to the facetime calls, that both parties agreed during cross examination that the child should be afforded complete privacy during such calls. the court should make such an order. unfortunately, an order for privacy was not part of the consent orders agreed by the parties and made by the court on 7 november 2023. there are a number of significant benefits for the child in a continuation of the arrangement. these were identified by the family report writer. it is conceded that she accepted that she was not fixed on an equal time arrangement necessarily as long as the time was substantial nonetheless, the benefits to the child for the continuation of an equal time arrangement included:- the child's lived experience for almost 4 years is the equal time arrangement agreed to between the parties. the family report writer considered that the child "is settled and accustomed to the current parenting arrangements.' the child not only accepts that arrangement he welcomes it. the child "indicated an acceptance of the shared care arrangement citing love and desire to spend time with each parent. ... [x] did not indicate a desire to change his living arrangements at this time. " neither parent identified major concerns in respect of the practical care provided to the child by the other party. "on balance, it is considered that a substantial change in [x]'s living arrangements at this time would most likely cause this child confusion and upset. taken from this child's point of view, shared parental care is accepted and welcome." communication between the parties was identified both by the family report writer and by the child as a continuing issue. from the child's perspective, he expressed concerns that the parties do not communicate at all. in particular he identified that the mother does not even greet the father at handovers or other times when they see each other. even at the family report interviews, when it might be expected that the mother would be on her best behaviour she did not observe even the most basic levels of civility by greeting the father or the paternal grandmother. while the mother considered that the father was overly effusive in his greetings of the mother, nonetheless he was at least trying. the parties agreed that they would participate in whatever course was required of them by the court in order to improve their communication. the father invites the court to make orders requiring the parties to attend, separately or together, co‑parenting courses to assist them. no matter what the arrangement put in place by the court, it will be important for the parties to improve their co-parenting relationship. the issues referred to above, relating to facetime and attendance at extracurricular activities were said by the mother to be having an adverse impact on her ability to parent the child during the week that the child was with her. given that the parties have now reached agreement about those matters, the issues for the mother should be substantially improved. it is therefore submitted that the court would make orders for a continuation of the equal time arrangement together with orders to assist the parties to improve their coparenting relationship. it is noted that the mother raises other issues relating to the equal time arrangement. none of those issues remained serious issues after cross examination. it became clear that any other issues were of minor moment to the mother compared to the key issues that she had relating to facetime and extracurricular activities. other s.60cc factors in this section, brief submissions will be made about those factors that have not otherwise been addressed above. there can be no doubt that the child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and others and will continue to benefit from a meaningful relationship with those people. it is now well-settled law that the phrase "meaningful relationship" does not mean "optimal". the court is, nonetheless, required to consider the arrangement that is in the best interests of the child. a continuation of the equal time arrangement will enable the child to maintain the current positive and meaningful relationships with both parties and other important people in the child's life. while the mother raises some issues relating to alleged family violence and other possible risks, neither party is in a position to properly suggest that they consider the child to be at any risk (let alone an unacceptable risk) in the other party's care given the history of agreed equal time arrangements. the child's views have been expressed clearly both to the icl and to the family report writer. there can be no doubt that the child strongly supports the continuation of the equal time arrangement. the mother is dismissive of the child's views and suggests that no weight should be given to them. while it is accepted that a child's views are but one factor to be considered, there is a basis for the child's views in this case to be given some weight. the child is 8 ½ years of age and has experienced the equal time arrangement for the better part of 4 years (almost half of his life). with that experience of the arrangements, he was glowing in his assessment of the success of the arrangement and of not wanting to change it. it would be inappropriate not to give any weight to the child’s views in those circumstances. it is submitted that significant weight should not be given to them. the likely effect of changes to the child's arrangements are significant. apart from confusion and distress, referred to by the family report writer, the child is likely to also experience a marginalisation of the father in his life. the mother has already shown that her attitude to the father is that he should be only a marginal influence in the child's life. she has shown this by her actions in withholding time on 2 separate occasions for extended periods without any, or any appropriate justification and for deliberate strategic reasons. the mother has emphasised her attitude to the father by ignoring the medical advice that he had obtained even prior to her obtaining a 2nd opinion. left to her own devices the court should be concerned that the mother will marginalise the father in the child's life such that the confusion and distress may well be exacerbated. family violence has been addressed elsewhere. the fact that there was a prior family violence order entered into by consent and without admissions should not be a factor in the determination of these issues as is submitted by the mother. that is a usual way in which family violence order matters are resolved. the purpose of those orders being agreed to on a "without admissions" basis is so that the order won't be taken into account adversely to the person agreeing to the order. the alternative would be that such orders would routinely need to go to hearing rather than resolving as they usually do. summary re parenting it is submitted that the best interests of the child lies in a continuation of the equal time arrangement that currently exists together with an order for equal shared parental responsibility. if the court is against a continuation of the equal time arrangement then it is submitted that the arrangement should be only marginally different from an equal time arrangement. the father is a person who is dedicated to his son and who was effectively, the child's primary carer for the majority of his life prior to separation and an equal carer since separation. the mother's key issues of complaint about the equal time arrangement have been resolved by agreement (albeit an order for privacy during facetime calls is still needed). in order to avoid the confusion and distress for the child, it is submitted that it would be appropriate to continue the equal time arrangement now that the key issues in dispute have been resolved. property matters the following issues will be addressed in relation to property matters :- asserted addbacks, remaining issues regarding the pool of assets, treatment of the husband's [super fund 1] pension entitlements, assessment of contributions, and section 75(2) factors. asserted addbacks in the balance sheet of the parties, the wife has included 4 entries for monies withdrawn by the husband post-separation and for which she seeks an addback. with the greatest of respect, the wife's submissions show a significant misunderstanding of the law on add-backs. there is a criticism of the husband in the wife's submissions because he was given leave to address a number of matters in evidence in chief. it is said that those matters should have been addressed in his affidavit. this was almost entirely related to the addbacks claimed by the wife. it is difficult to understand how that submission could be justified. the wife's trial affidavit did not suggest that any addback was appropriate or raise the issue in any helpful way. as a result, the husband and his legal team only became aware that add-backs were being sought as a result of the case outline filed on the wife's behalf. in those circumstances it was entirely appropriate that the husband should address those matters in his evidence in chief. it is noted that there was no objection to this process. the primary position of the court, in well-established authority referred to in the list of authorities below, is that addbacks are the exception and not the rule. that is, only in exceptional cases will the court consider making a notional addback. this is the case in relation to any type of proposed addback, including legal fees. for example, in the leading decision of [nhc & rch] the court's summary of the position relating to legal fees was " [56] ... while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. [57] if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them." the court went on to discuss the payment of legal fees from monies generated post separation (at paragraph 58 – 60). funds received by a party will usually not be added back to the pool of assets if the funds were used for necessary and reasonable living expenses or was otherwise spent appropriately. the context of the husband having withdrawn funds in the period post separation included that the wife was living rent-free in the [suburb p] property and all of her legal fees (apparently totalling about $340,000) were being met by her employer. this was a huge financial resource available to the wife that was not disclosed until she had misled the court in answers in cross examination, requiring a correction in re-examination. the specific addbacks sought by the wife are:- $9,950 withdrawn by the husband from the [suburb p] mortgage between february and march 2021. the husband gave evidence that he used those funds for legal fees 5. there was an urgent need for the husband to obtain legal advice in that period as a result of the wife's actions in withholding the child from spending any time with him, and commencing proceedings contemporaneously. the husband had no other resources from which to obtain urgent access to funds in order to ensure that he participated fully in the proceedings to obtain orders (which were ultimately, albeit belatedly, agreed to between the parties) for the child to spend time with him. while this was occurring, the wife was happily having her legal fees paid by an independent 3rd party. it is reasonable that the court would not, in its discretion notionally add this amount to the pool of assets. $10,000 from the sale of [motor vehicle 2]. the husband's evidence (not challenged in cross examination) was that he used these funds immediately after separation to establish himself in rental accommodation and acquire some necessary white goods and furniture. it is concerning that the wife seeks an addback of these funds in those circumstances. no addback should be made. $26,918 withdrawn from his [z bank] investments. the husband's evidence about this (in his evidence in chief) was that some of it had been spent on his rental property expenses and the balance was used to make lump-sum payments onto the [suburb p] mortgage. however, the husband now seeks leave to tender the [z bank] 'managed investment funds statement' from 1997 to [late] 2023 (annexed to these submissions). this document was provided to the applicant in the discovery process in [late] 2023 and outlines the withdrawals totalling $26,918 were made from 2001 to 2016. given the late raising of this addback in the wife's case outline, the husband did not have the opportunity to review this document ahead of his evidence in chief and it is in this context that he seeks leave to tender this document. the court would otherwise be left with incorrect information regarding this withdrawal, purported to be (on the applicant's case) an addback accrued post-separation. this statement outlines the monies were withdrawn during the relationship, and there is no basis for this addback. $66,293 withdrawn in [early] 2023. this amount was an amount received by the husband as a result of the ending of his employment [...], relating to annual leave and long service leave entitlements. the monies were received substantially post separation and were used by the husband partly on legal fees and partly on other expenditure. it is difficult to see how, to use the words used by the court in nhc & rch, the wife could be said to have an interest in this money by way of contributions or otherwise. it is likely that the amount should be considered a contribution by the husband. this amount has not been included in the assessment of contributions by him. it was entirely reasonable that he use funds that he received as a result of his cessation of employment to meet his legal fees and other living expenses. again, noting that the wife's legal fees were paid by a third party benefactor, the court should not, in its discretion, add any amount back even if it could be said that the wife does have an interest in the funds. the wife's submissions then suggest that, if the amounts are not added back, the court should take into account the husband's receipt of these amounts pursuant to section 75(2)(0). if the court finds, as submitted above, that no addback is appropriate then it should also be the case that the withdrawal of the funds should not be taken into account in any other way. other issues re balance sheet other than in relation to addbacks and the [super fund 1] pension entitlements, the only other issue regarding the pool of assets appears to be that the wife seeks to include a post separation credit card liability. there is no basis to include this liability, especially in circumstances where the wife made the conscious decision not to pay mortgage instalments and was in receipt of the previously undisclosed massive financial resource of her legal fees being paid. the wife's credit card liability should not be included in the balance sheet. the wife says that she concedes the value of the necklace & ring at $35,000 only if the husband is to receive those items. this is an inappropriate and unhelpful approach to valuations on the balance sheet. in those circumstances it is submitted that the value of the necklace and ring should be excluded from the pool and that the wife should be required to return those items to the husband. on her evidence the value of those items is nominal in any event. [super fund 1] pension entitlements the husband is in receipt of his [super fund 1] benefits by way of pension in the payment phase. he receives that benefit as a result of a finding of invalidity arising from a workplace incident prior to the commencement of the relationship. the finding of invalidity occurred in late 2022 and the husband commenced receiving his pension entitlements in early 2023. the court has a discretion as to the way in which a pension in the payment phase should be treated. the family law value of the pension entitlements is before the court as an agreed amount. this is a necessary precursor to any possible split of those entitlements but is not a capital amount that the husband can access. given the finding of invalidity for the husband the court should find that he is unlikely to ever return to paid employment. this means that his only source of income will continue to be the pension entitlements he receives. as indicated above, the only reason he is even able to receive the amount now is because of the finding of invalidity. that is, both the amount he receives and the timing of his receipt of his benefits are dependent upon the invalidity he has suffered arising from the workplace incident. but for the finding of invalidity, the husband's pension entitlements would clearly be nowhere near what he currently receives. at paragraph 44 of the wife's submissions, she sets out the current family law value – greater than $1.[5] million. at paragraph 46 she sets out the value at separation - less than $500,000. this shows that the value of the entitlements that he receives are significantly dependent upon the finding of invalidity. this is similar to the receipt of funds arising from personal injuries or other claims. in such cases the contribution is held to be made by the person whose injury resulted in the payment in any event, the husband has no other source of income and it would be appropriate for the court to treat his pension entitlements as an income stream in his hands rather than as the lump sum that is the family law value. the wife's position would be that she receives a 50% interest in the husband's pension entitlements while continuing to receive her own income. even in this scenario the wife does not suggest an adjustment in favour of the husband for section 75(2) factors. contributions at the commencement of the relationship the wife owned a property at [suburb g], [city b]. when the property was sold in [late] 2013 the wife received net proceeds of approximately $274,000. at the commencement of the relationship the husband owned 3 properties. the [suburb w] and [suburb p] properties that are in the balance sheet were properties owned by him at the commencement of the relationship. historical valuations have been obtained for these properties showing that the properties were valued at approximately $378,000 & $650,000 respectively, as at [late] 2011. the third property was in [city qq]. this property was sold in 2014. the husband received approximately $200,000 net proceeds. during the relationship the wife received an inheritance of $85,000 in late 2019. similarly, during the relationship the husband received funds from his father as follows:- $32[0],000 in 2 payments [in] 2013, between 2013 and 2014, further amounts totalling $40,000, and $96,6[5]0 [in] 2019, being a payment to the husband from his father’s superannuation benefits upon his death. there is some suggestion in the wife's submissions that the use of the above funds is not known. the husband gives clear evidence that these funds were used for the parties' joint project in the property they owned together in [suburb y], nsw. the court will generally apply a presumption that monies received by a party were used for the benefit of the family unit unless there is evidence to the contrary. during the relationship the husband did not work in paid employment and was the primary carer for all 3 children in the parties' care. this was, effectively, conceded. except for a period of time after the birth of the child [x], the wife was in full time employment throughout the relationship. despite not being in paid employment, the husband received an income throughout the relationship through [workers compensation]. the husband was engaged in non-financial contributions [in] relation to the [suburb y] property and other properties owned by them. this was not really challenged in cross examination. the assessment of contributions clearly favours the husband to a significant degree. the capital contributions, not including either the [suburb w] or [suburb p] properties, amount to over $660 000. in addition, he received income and was the primary carer of the children as well as the main home maker. on that basis it is submitted that contributions should be found to be approximately 75% to the husband and 25% to the wife. section 75(2) factors the husband is 48 years of age and is unlikely to return to paid employment. if his [super fund 1] pension is treated as an income stream in his hands, then he has a valuable source which amounts to approximately $85,000 per annum income. the wife is 51 years of age. she receives approximately $80,500 income per annum and an additional amount of approximately $10,000 by way of family assistance. it is likely that she has a future working life of 15 or 16 years or more. the care arrangements for the child [x] are to be determine by the court. the husband’s position is that an equal time arrangement should continue. even if the court is minded to order a different arrangement, it is likely to still be substantial time in the father's care. it is submitted that even in that situation the care of the child would be a neutral factor. the wife has had the advantage of the substantial financial resource relating to the payment of her legal fees (apparently as much as $340,000) rather than having to meet those from her own resources. this means that, whatever the outcome from the court, the wife will be in a far better position because the third party benefactor has chosen to fund the wife in this way. it is argued in the wife's submissions that the payment of her legal fees does not amount to a future financial resource. with respect, this is not a significant argument against taking this resource into account. even if the receipt of these funds does not fall within the strict definition of future financial resource, the provisions of section 75(2)(0) are certainly broad enough to take into account other definitions. in any event, as set out above, the wife’s financial position will be substantially greater as a result of the payment of her legal fees because none of the award that she receives will need to be used to pay outstanding fees. this is a substantial resource that the wife has received. it is noted that only upon providing false evidence to the court was the information disclosed in re-examination. it was inappropriate that the wife did not disclose this substantial resource prior to that time. on the basis that the husband's pension entitlements are considered as the income stream in his hands, then it is conceded that an adjustment to the wife would be appropriate. the court is required to consider the dollar amount of any adjustment. it is noted that the wife seeks an adjustment of 15%. this would amount to approximately a $540,000 differential. with respect, that would be an extraordinary adjustment in the circumstances. a 2.5% adjustment to the wife would result in a 5% differential to the outcome. this is approximately $90,000. it is submitted that this would be an appropriate adjustment in the circumstances. justice & equity the husband seeks to retain both properties but also to be able to make the choice as to which of the properties he sells if it transpires that he is unable to make the payment to the wife that is required by the orders. the wife accepted that the husband could have this opportunity. otherwise, the husband will need sufficient time in order to meet the payment to the wife and to pay out the existing mortgage over the [suburb p] property, if that is required. summary it is submitted that it is in the child's best interests for a continuation of the equal time arrangement that has been in place for almost 4 years and which is strongly desired by the child. it is also submitted that the mother's attitude to the child's relationship with father is such that it is likely the father would be marginalised in the child's life if the orders sought by her were in fact made. in relation to property matters, it is a relatively straightforward matter that the contributions substantially favour the husband. it is also a relatively straightforward matter that there would be an adjustment to the wife as a result of the husband's financial resource. the wife's position is significantly outside of any reasonable range of outcomes that might be expected as a result of this application of relatively straightforward assessments of contributions and future factors.
written submissions on behalf of the independent children’s lawyer
the parties’ positions the mother seeks sole parental responsibility for [x] and to reduce [x]'s time with the father from the current week-about, shared care arrangement to four nights per fortnight with the father, time on special occasions and half of each school holiday period. the father seeks that the current arrangement remain in place, being equal shared parental responsibility and a week-about, shared care arrangement. observations/credibility both the mother and father appear to have some personality and/or mental health vulnerabilities which have impacted on their ability to parent [x], especially in a co-operative manner. the mother accepts her vulnerabilities and deposes to (and provides supporting evidence of) high levels of stress and anxiety. the mother deposes to addressing those issues via monthly therapeutic counselling with [ms k]. [ms k] provided an affidavit in the proceedings which was not challenged by cross-examination, but which was largely accepted only in relation to the impact of the current situation on the mother and not in relation to comments made by [ms k] about the father. the mother acknowledged acting unilaterally and for the purposes of obtaining an advantage in the litigation including withholding [x] at the commencement of the school year in 2021 to ensure he attended her preferred school (which she admitted) and keeping detailed notes of [x]'s conversations with his father and paternal grandmother (which was admitted but not as being for the purposes of litigation). these actions by the mother might cause the court some concerns as to the mother’s general motivations as might some of the mother’s evidence relating to the financial issues including non-payment of the mortgage over the [suburb p] property and payment of her legal fees. overall, the mother presented as either unwilling or unable to make changes to better the co-parenting relationship between her and the father. the father attempted to present himself in an overly positive and child-focused light, particularly in his affidavit evidence. the father only made appropriate concessions when pressed under cross-examination. by way of example, the father was not forthright in his written evidence about the circumstances of the parties’ separation [in late] 2019 and only demonstrated some limited insight into the impact of his action on all of the children when pressed relatively hard about it by way of cross-examination. more significantly, material produced by [dr f] (albeit for proceedings other than these) suggested significant defects in the father’s make-up which are likely, in the icl’s view, to permeate all of his inter-personal relationships. in her 2021 report [dr f] indicated that:   naish] presents with symptoms with a clinical picture consistent with a diagnosis of chronic adjustment disorder on the background of a probable personality disorder. as a result of his maladaptive personality traits, he has been unable to work through his psychological injury neither clinically nor using a rehabilitation model ... he continues to be embittered, unmotivated and preoccupied with a sense of injustice and irritable. these factors will interfere with securing and maintaining employment in any setting ... his personality appears to be characterised by an externalising attributional style. this has interfered with his ability to work in a rehabilitation paradigm. his personality is entrenched and it is unlikely to respond to rehabilitation or treatment ... psychological treatment does not appear to have resulted in significant improvement. i suspect this is not the fault of the treatment model but of [mr naish]’s underlying personality. this makes his condition treatment resistant. the father agreed that [dr f]’s description of him was likely accurate as at the time it was written. interestingly, that is the same time as the mother deposed she effectively ceased trying to co-operatively parent with him. that had not occurred to the father until it was put to him under cross-examination and he appeared to struggle to understand the correlation. the father repeatedly gave evidence to the court that he was not on any medication and that he was not subject to any treatment plans. the father appeared not to appreciate that perhaps he should be. when asked what he was doing about the issues raised by [dr f], his evidence was to the effect that he was trying to be a better person and that he was now seeking some sort of spiritual or religious guidance from a church he has recently been attending. it is likely, in the icl’s submissions, that the father has some very significant underlying psychological issues that are impacting on his functioning including parenting functioning. whilst not necessarily lacking in credibility, the father was demonstrably lacking in insight into his own vulnerabilities and shortcomings and the impact of the resultant behaviour on [x] and the mother.
parental responsibility the mother submits that the presumption in section 61da of the family law act 1975 (‘the act’) relation to equal shared parental responsibility is rebutted given the violence she says the father perpetrated against her during the relationship and particularly at separation [in late] 2019. the icl supports the mother’s submissions as to that incident and shares her concerns as to the father’s behaviour at and surrounding the breakdown of the parties’ relationship [in late] 2019. given the independent evidence available to the court, there is little doubt that was an incident of family violence which impacted the mother significantly and which likely also impacted the children including [x]. the father now accepts, in his written submissions filed 22 december 2023, that the incident amounted to a ‘serious incident of family violence’ and that although ‘the incident was not directed at the mother or the children ... it is clear that they would have been frightened by the incident’.1 by way of observation, that concession by the father about the incident of family violence appears significantly more insightful and readily given than the evidence he gave at trial under cross examination and which is referred to in the mother’s written submissions filed 1 december 2023 at paragraph 9 and certainly significantly different from his evidence at paragraph 49 of the father’s trial affidavit filed 16 october 2023. even if the court determines that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not rebutted, the icl submits that it is not in [x]'s best interests for his parents to have equal shared parental responsibility where at the commencement of trial the parties remained in significant conflict about long-term issues including [x]'s school and health-related issues. whilst it is to the parties’ credit that the issue of schooling and health did narrow (as set out in paragraphs 26 – 28 of the father’s written submissions) that took a final hearing and all that encompassed to get there. the court could not have any confidence that the parties, left on their own, will be able to resolve their differences into the future. in relation to school issues, the parties have previously had a significant dispute about [x]'s schooling in early 2021. both parties appear to have acted at that time in a way to ensure [x] attended their preferred school. these actions included the mother withholding [x] from the father and the father withdrawing [x] from [suburb n school] and enrolling him in [jj school]. in the end, and notwithstanding the father did not pursue his application at the court event, the court’s intervention was necessary to confirm where [x] should commence his schooling. even under cross-examination at trial, the father maintained his concerns about [x]’s performance at [suburb n school] and confirmed his wish that he change schools and attend a smaller catholic school. the father had demonstrably not considered his proposal for a change of schools in any detail (including not reviewing or comparing the competing schools naplan results), nor had he considered that [x]'s difficulties at school may stem from an underlying difficulty on [x]'s part and not an issue with the school’s performance. whilst the parents have come to an agreement to discuss [x]'s schooling again at mediation and following a determination on the issues of property, there remains a significant risk that agreement will not be reached. each of the parents also appeared to have taken unilateral steps in relation to [x]'s medical and broader health needs. by way of example, the father agreed he did not inform the mother of [x]'s optometrist appointments and the mother conceded that she had effectively disregarded an asthma diagnosis where it was obtained without her input by the father. the court could have little to no confidence that the parents will not continue to take unilateral action in relation to future disagreements in relation to [x]'s future medical and health needs. the father’s unwillingness or inability, until the commencement of trial, to agree to reduce facetime would likely cause the court further concern as to the parents ability to make joint decisions into the future. the mother applied to the court in august 2022 for a reduction in the frequency and duration of facetime calls between [x] and the father and for the father to cease attending extracurricular activities. the mother provided significantly compelling evidence at that time as to the issues with the facetime calls and the father’s attendance at extracurricular activities. the father could have, at that time (or during prior negotiations), accepted the mother’s concerns and acceded to the mother’s application. that he did not is unsurprising. as at 27 april 2023 the father had independent evidence supporting the mother’s position on the two issues. he could have, and likely should have, agreed to reduce facetime and not attend extracurricular activities whilst [x] was in the mother’s care at that time. he did not so until trial. in the icl’s submissions this demonstrates a lack of insight on the father’s part, an inability or unwillingness to accept the mother’s position on issues he does not agree with, both of which are likely required for future agreement on significant issues. as indicated above the mother appeared to have little to no ability or willingness to work with the father as to improving communication or working co-operatively with him which must cause the court concern as to future agreement on significant issues as would the evidence that the father likely has significant personality and/or mental health issues that might require professional assistance that are not currently being addressed in any way. finally, in relation to parental responsibility, the expert witness gave evidence that the parents are likely to struggle to make big decisions together and that were [x] to move into the primary care of the mother, it would not be unreasonable that she hold sole parental responsibility. arrangements for time and relevant section 60cc factors section 60cc (2) (a) all parties and the expert witness agree that [x] has a meaningful relationship with each of his parents and that derives benefit from it. where that is the case, it is highly likely that [x] can continue to have a beneficial and meaningful relationship with the father even if his time with the father is reduced. the expert witness was clear that although she supported a shared care arrangement, that was not the same as equal shared care or week about. section 60cc (2) (b) properly, given their applications before the court, neither party suggested that [x] is exposed to unacceptable risk in the other parent’s care. the mother, however, suggests that [x] is exposed to psychological harm in the father’s care given the father’s personality and mental health issues remain untreated. the icl supports the mother’s position as to possible psychological harm to [x] in the father’s care. that harm arises as follows: both the father and parental grandmother clearly hold highly negative views of the mother and her family including [mr h] and, to a lesser extent, [j]. the persistent reports to the child and youth protection service (‘cyps’) are probably the best example of those negative views. when cross-examined about the possible outcomes of reporting to cyps, the father appeared to have never before considered that [x] might, for example, be interviewed by police which would likely be confronting for him. the icl considers it likely that [x], whether consciously or not on the part of the paternal family, has been exposed to those negative views of [x]'s maternal family. the father has made a number of significant decisions which, in the icl’s view, have furthered or exacerbated the conflict between the parties. such decisions include: the father’s persistence in seeking and sustaining a family violence order apparently on behalf of his mother and seeking to protect her from the mother and her partner. that appears to be an ill-considered and unsustainable application and is likely to have increased the stress and anxiety already experience by the mother. the father and paternal grandmother’s persistence in attending [x]'s extra-curricular activities including [sports] lessons. the impression gained from the mother’s evidence is that the father engages in overt behaviour which, consciously or not, undermines the mother’s position as the primarily parent at that time. the father and paternal grandmother’s persistence in attending at [x]'s medical appointments including as recently as [mid] 2023. the mother’s evidence as to that appointment is suggestive of denigration and undermining of the mother’s position at that appointment and in front of [x]. in relation to the issues of the father’s attendance at extra-curricular activities it is acknowledged that agreement was reached on the issues at the conclusion of day 1 of trial to the effect that the father and paternal grandmother agreed not to attend extra-curricular activities. it is of significant concern that such a concession was made only after the first day of trial and not when the mother first raised the issue or in august 2022 when the mother filed an application in a proceeding seeking orders to that effect. in the icl’s view, this demonstrates a significant inability on the part of the father to recognise and prioritise [x]'s best interests above his own interests. section 60cc (3) (a) whilst [x] gave a view that he did not wish the current arrangements to change, there was some evidence to suggest he has been impacted by the conflict between his parents and feels a wish to please each of them. accordingly, and given his age, the icl submits the court could not place significant weight on [x]'s expressed views and wishes. section 60cc (3) (b) [x] appears to have meaningful relationships with his parents, [mr h] and [j], [...] and his paternal grandmother. the mother makes submissions as to the nature of the relationship between [x] and the paternal grandmother and suggests she acts as a ‘pseudo parent’ to [x]. some questions were asked of the father as to the paternal grandmother’s involvement in [x]'s life including her attendance at medical appointments, extracurricular activities and at [x]'s appointment with the icl. unfortunately – and perhaps tellingly – the paternal grandmother was not made available for cross examination on this issue or other issues that were before the court. given she was available for cross examination up until the father gave his evidence, the court may draw a negative inference from that. given the paternal grandmother did not give evidence, questions as to her current attitude towards the mother and maternal family, the father’s behaviour, the degree to which she is involved in parenting [x] and the family violence order sought by the father against the mother and her partner were not addressed by her. the father’s attitude to, and treatment of, the mother’s older children remains concerning given [x] appears to have a close relationship with [mr h] and [j]. [mr h]’s evidence about his experience of the father was not contested. [mr h] appears to be a significant person in [x]'s life and both willing and able to care for him in the way he deposed to doing (such a pickups from school on [bikes]). the father’s apparent lack of support for that relationship is not in [x]'s best interests. section 60cc (3) (d) the evidence, including that of the expert witness, suggested that a significant change to [x]'s current arrangements would likely have a negative impact on him. as set out above, the expert witness confirmed her view that [x] should remain in a shared care arrangement but that was not necessarily an equal shared care arrangement. in weighing up the concerns set out at paragraphs 38 – 40 above, [x]'s possible exposure to future conflict and the impact on [x] of a change to the current arrangement, the icl supports a reduction in [x]'s time with the father. in the icl’s view a reduction to 5 nights per fortnight with the father strikes a reasonable balance between the suggestion that a significant change to it might negatively impact [x] and the ongoing risks to which [x] is exposed including each parents negative view of the other and their family. section 60cc (3) (f) the capacity for each parent to provide for [x]'s emotional needs appears compromised by their conflict, their respective negative views of the other and their respective vulnerabilities. the father’s capacity is likely more compromised than the mother’s given [dr f]’s opinion and his lack of insight. it may be that a change to the current arrangements as sought by the icl both in relation to parental responsibility and time with arrangements may assist the mother’s stress and anxiety as will the change to the facetime and extracurricular arrangements. the father will likely feel aggrieved should the court reduce his time and make an order for sole parental responsibility. the father might consider seeking therapeutic assistance with some of the issues raised by [dr f] and during the trial though the icl does not submit the court should make orders requiring him to do so. section 60cc (3) (g) there are some concerns about [x]'s progress at school. whilst the father appeared to underlying issues that might be impacting his learning. these should be explored and are likely to be so in the event the mother holds sole parental responsibility. sections 60cc (j) and (k) as addressed elsewhere in these submissions. conclusion for all of the reasons set out above, the icl supports the mother having sole parental responsibility for [x] and [x] spending time with the father for 5 nights each fortnight. the icl supports the final orders sought by the mother in her further amended initiating application filed except as follows: in relation to parental responsibility (order 1) the court might consider making an order requiring the mother to consult the father in relation to major long-term decisions for [x] and seeks his views on the issue to be decided. in relation to time between [x] and the father during the school term (order 2), the time be from after school or 3pm each alternate thursday to the commencement of school or 9am tuesday.
written submissions in reply on behalf of the applicant
procedural matters on 8 november 2023, orders were made for the filing and serving of submissions of no more than 6 pages for parenting and 6 pages for property. whilst the applicant complied with the page limits, the respondent did not. given the length of the respondent's submissions, the applicant requires more than 3 pages to reply and seeks leave for same. the respondent seeks to tender a [z bank] statement, which is annexed to his submissions. a number of the documents the applicant sought to tender were not accepted by the court on the basis that those documents were not shown to the respondent during cross-examination. the applicant objects to the respondent relying on this document on the basis that this document was not shown to her during her cross-examination. icl’s submissions in relation to paragraph 11, while the applicant conceded under cross-examination that she withheld [x] for the purposes of "obtaining an advantage in the litigation", it cannot be deduced from the evidence of the mother that she took the alleged actions for that reason. the respondent and icl submissions appear to suggest that the applicant withheld [x] for her own benefit in the proceedings rather than because she considered that it was in [x]'s best interests to do so, and that she should be criticised for that. the mother should not be criticised for acting protectively following the significant incident of domestic violence at separation, for which [x] was present. it would be improper to suggest on the evidence that her motivation was anything other than to ensure that [x] was protected from harm. this is similarly the case in relation to the applicant and her current partner, [mr d], taking notes of [x]'s phone and facetime calls with the respondent. the applicant's evidence was that she and [mr d] did this due to concerns they had about what was being said during the calls and the impact that may have on [x]. the applicant denies that she and [mr d] wrote notes for some other, self-serving reason. the applicant's evidence was that she was concerned about the facetime calls, particularly after witnessing [x]'s distress and she wrote notes contemporaneously in order to provide evidence to the court in support of the orders she ultimately sought. the applicant agrees that [x] should be afforded privacy for these phone calls, and has sought an order to that effect. respondent’s submissions in relation to paragraph 12, it is submitted that the applicant did not have difficulty accepting any positive attributes of the respondent. the applicant describes the relationship between the respondent and [x] in her affidavit at paragraphs 174 to 175 . when questioned about this in cross-examination, the applicant confirmed that she did mention positive attributes about the respondent in her affidavit. in relation to paragraph 15, the applicant's oral evidence was that, for a portion of the time that she was living at the [suburb p] property without making payments towards the home loan, she prioritised paying legal fees or arranged a moratorium in circumstances where the parties had agreed to sell the [suburb p] property. the applicant's employer did not pay the applicant's legal fees for her previous lawyers. for a portion of the time that the applicant lived in the [suburb p] property, she did pay legal fees herself. the applicant did not "lie", nor could her evidence be considered deceptive or "egregious" as the respondent submits. in paragraph 28, the respondent submits that an order for the applicant to have sole parental responsibility would be "rewarding" the applicant for her behaviour. the court is required to consider whether the applicant having sole parental responsibility is in [x]'s best interests not whether a parent should be "rewarded" or not. the applicant's position is that the evidence suggests that it is in [x]'s best interests for the applicant to have sole parental responsibility, and this is supported by the icl and also the family report writer, if the time between the respondent and [x] is reduced. in relation to paragraph 44, the respondent's submission that the applicant withheld [x] from him without any appropriate justification highlights the respondent's lack of insight into his own behaviour at separation. in relation to paragraph 48, the respondent's submission that the applicant is seeking a reduction of time "as a result of 2 issues about which the parties were unable to reach agreement" is incorrect and lacks insight into the other underlying issues, such as [x] modelling the respondent's behaviours, the respondent's untreated mental health, the high conflict relationship between the parties, the respondent's attitude towards the applicant as demonstrated by his reports to cyps, and the other issues summarised in paragraphs 260-269 of the applicant's affidavit. in relation to paragraph 51, the applicant's criticism of the respondent for not addressing the matter in his affidavit relates to the husband's failure to address in his affidavit that he received $66,[000] from [his employer] at the cessation of his employment (which included various leave entitlements accrued during the relationship). the categorisation of addbacks is not a matter for evidence but for submissions. the respondent should have included this in his evidence and disclosed it to the applicant prior to the filing of trial material. the applicant was not able to address the matter in her affidavit because she did not receive financial disclosure about the matter until after her material was due. in relation to paragraph 56, we refer to paragraph 7 above. it is incorrect to state that all of the applicant's legal fees were paid by her employer. the applicant gave evidence that she met her previous lawyer's legal fees and that her legal fees with [c law firm] were met by her employer, but that she contributed to disbursements and paid the fees for the family violence order proceedings. the applicant submits that the funds provided to her from her employer are best categorised as a gift (akin to a family member gifting funds) and denies that the funds received are a future financial resource available to her. in relation to paragraph 57(a), the respondent suggests that, because he needed legal advice urgently and had no other funds available to him, the joint funds he used for legal fees should not be notionally added back into the asset pool. the case law in this regard is settled. it remained open to the respondent to obtain a personal loan or obtain assistance from a third party (which he ultimately did), however, he dissipated marital funds instead. in relation to paragraph 57(c), the applicant no longer presses this as an addback. in relation to paragraph 60, the respondent's position in his proposed terms of settlement is for the applicant to retain the necklace and ring at $35,000. the applicant is unable to corroborate an estimate of $35,000 for the jewellery absent the respondent's disclosure. the applicant does not wish to retain the necklace and the ring. in circumstances where the respondent has ascribed a value of $35,000 for the jewellery, the applicant proposes he retain the jewellery with an ascribed value of $35,000. in relation to paragraph 68, the respondent has not provided any evidence as to the equity in the [suburb p], [suburb w] and [city qq] properties at the commencement of cohabitation. the respondent has not disclosed any home loan statements for these properties from the time of cohabitation. the applicant's position is that these properties had minimal equity at the commencement of cohabitation. in relation to paragraph 72, the applicant cannot be satisfied that all of the funds were applied towards the benefit of the family unit in circumstances where the bank statements produced by the respondent evidence a number of gambling transactions and the respondent conceded in his oral evidence that he gambled a lot during the relationship. in relation to paragraph 73, the respondent admitted that his mental health affected his capacity in terms of chores and the applicant's evidence is that the respondent's homemaking and parenting contributions were limited to cooking and taking the children to and from school. the applicant also submits that the respondent committed family violence towards her children, [mr h] and [j], during the relationship. [mr h]'s evidence in this regard is unchallenged and the applicant deposes to [j]'s mental health at paragraph 252 of her affidavit as a result of the respondent's treatment of her during the relationship. in relation to paragraph 75, the applicant submits that a 25% adjustment in the respondent's favour is not just and equitable in all of the circumstances, particularly in light of her financial contributions, including her inheritance, the net proceeds of sale of the [suburb g] property, paying for all household expenses and outgoings, paying for the children's expenses and equally contributing to the deposit for the [suburb y] property. in relation to paragraph 77, the applicant receives family tax benefit from centrelink. the applicant has the primary care of [j] and does not receive periodic child support from her father. the applicant is 3 years older than the respondent. if she retires at 65 years of age, she will be reliant on her superannuation, which will gradually be depleted, whereas the respondent will receive a [super fund 1] pension for life in the sum of $86,500.70 per annum (which increases with cpi each year). the respondent also has the benefit of his [super fund 2] superannuation accumulation plan in addition to his [super fund 1]. in relation to paragraph 78, the applicant submits that she will continue to meet the lion's share of [x]'s expenses regardless of the care arrangements. in relation to paragraph 79, it is incorrect to state that the applicant did not meet any of her legal fees from her own resources. the applicant submits that she will not be in a far better position than the respondent as a result of her employer paying her legal fees. in relation to paragraph 80, the respondent argues that the gift from the applicant's employer ought to be considered under section 75(2)(o) of the act but that the financial resources he received after separation, such as his cessation entitlements, withdrawal from the [suburb p] home loan and net proceeds of sale of the [motor vehicle 2] ought not to be. based on the costs notices filed with the court, the respondent's legal fees were estimated to be $120,000 (although this does not appear to include his previous lawyer's fees). the applicant's legal fees were estimated to be $340,000, which included work undertaken to defend family violence order proceedings initiated by the respondent as a self-represented litigant. the respondent contends that the significant difference in the estimates is as a result of the respondent's approach to litigation. if the applicant did not accept the gift from her employer, any cash payment she received from the applicant would likely have been applied towards her outstanding legal fees. in relation to paragraph 81, the applicant denies that she provided false evidence to the court because she did pay legal fees from her own resources initially. in relation to paragraphs 82 and 83, it is the applicant's submission that a 2.5% adjustment in her favour for future needs is not just and equitable and that she should receive a 15% adjustment if: she does not receive a split of the respondent's [super fund 1], she has the primary care of [x], the addbacks she asserts are instead treated as financial resources. this is in circumstances where: the respondent will have an invalidity pension for life and will also have the benefit of his [super fund 2] superannuation, whereas the balance of the applicant's superannuation will be depleted overtime [mr pp]’s report points out at paragraph 37, that if the applicant accessed her superannuation entitlement now, it would equate to a pension of $8,474 per annum), the applicant will continue to meet the lion's share of [x]'s expenses and will receive minimal child support from the respondent, the respondent is entitled to a quarter of his father's estate pursuant to his father's will.
outline of principle 4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. "[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms." because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be "best" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing.
on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to “give the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.” on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the “natural limitations” that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the “feeling” of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole.   the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(2))  ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s 60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues:
the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility.  ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words “meaningful involvement”. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting:
the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements.  ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]–[199]):  6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) — (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than “1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays” or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve “both” parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children.  ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system”. “meaning” is defined as “having intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)”. a second definition is “conveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive”. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines “meaning” (in generalised use) as “significance”. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as “full of meaning, significant”. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as “expressive or significant: a meaning look”. [26] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
i am conscious that a long-distance relationship, with longer but less frequent times spent together, is inevitably different from a relationship where people live closer together with regular face-to-face contact. but it does not itself mean it cannot be meaningful.
we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o’ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]:
the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a “meaningful relationship” with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court’s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child’s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider “the benefit to the child” of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j’s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original)
the full court also observed at [191]: “the first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression ‘meaningful relationship’ is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a ‘meaningful relationship’ ”.  7] for our part, we echo the view expressed by the trial judge of the serious nature of depriving the father of contact in circumstances where that appears to have been engineered by the mother, without any fault on the part of the father at all. this cannot be in a child's best interests. [178] it also does not appear to us to be appropriate for a parent to be able to manipulate the family law system to such an extent that the other parent's hope of ever seeing the child again, rests upon the possibility that she may wish to seek him out in later adolescence or adulthood. [179] we think that a family court would not be doing its duty if it were to simply give in to these sorts of considerations, except in the most extreme case and only then, when a positive determination is made that the welfare of the child requires it.
given the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the court must consider the conduct of the parents, not with a view to rewarding one or punishing the other, but to ascertain from such conduct whether the welfare of the child will be better served in the custody of one or the other.  ] section 79 demands a consideration, separately, of all of its requirements without conflation. provided a trial judge has done so, and the reasons demonstrate that this has been done, no error is demonstrated by a failure to follow a particular order in doing so. further, the breadth and depth of the consideration of the s.79(2) issue, and the extent of an adequate exposition of it in the reasons, will vary from case to case. in that respect, the plurality in bevan said, at [82], that the separate s.79(2) issue will, “...in many cases ... [be] ... effectively answered in the affirmative by the way the parties present their cases.” [20] each of those conclusions conforms entirely with what was said about those issues by the high court in stanford v stanford (2012) 247 clr 108. [21] first, it is “...not possible to chart [the] metes and bounds” of the relevant discretion. just as importantly, it was recognised specifically that the characteristics of individual marriage unions, in so far as they acquire, hold and deal with property, differ. in “many cases”, the union is underpinned by “...stated and unstated assumptions between the parties to a marriage that the arrangement of property interests, whatever they are, is sufficient for the purposes of the husband and wife during the continuance of their marriage” (stanford, at [41]). and, in “many cases”, (but, not all) the “...just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied...” by the fact of separation: “[i]t will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order ... because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife” (stanford at [42]).
“...what is ‘plainly wrong’ will vary in the eyes of different beholders” and also the fact that the “...functions and purposes of the court ... [involve] ... difficult and evaluative decisions...” such that “...any two decision-makers may, with complete integrity and upon the same material, often come to differing conclusions”. (cdj at [186(2)], per kirby j).  ] ... as we have already said, there is no requirement to attribute different percentages to different periods in the relationship. indeed the full court has cautioned against it: see dickons & dickons (2012) 50 fam lr 244, lovine & connor and anor [2012] famcafc 168, (2012) flc 93-515 and bolger & headon [2014] famcafc 27 where the full court said at [28], “[d]oing so ... is not consistent with a holistic assessment of the parties’ contributions which is what s.79(4) requires.” it is only if error can be demonstrated in the overall result that the appeal would succeed.  8] ... the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by s.79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.  ] any and all such contributions, whether or not they sound in, or are directly linked to, the property available for distribution, should be considered and assessed together with the nature, form and extent of all other contributions of all types contemplated otherwise by s 79(4). [19] that is true of assets or income generated within the relationship and it is equally true of assets or income coming from outside of the relationship (for example, as here, in the form of inheritances). in the same way, s 79(4) specifically requires the court to take into account contributions made to the welfare of the family (and substantively and “...not in any merely token way...”, see, mallett v mallett [1984] hca 21, (1984) 156 clr 605 at 636 per wilson j) notwithstanding that those contributions may not be, or cannot be seen to be, directly linked to the available property at trial, or any increase or decrease in the value of the property. [20] put another way, consistent with authority, the s 79 discretion involves as a necessary requirement that “... trial judges weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such an assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties or provide for a transfer of property in specie in accordance with that assessment.” (in the marriage of aleksovski [1996] famcafc 111, (1996) 20 fam lr 894 at 903). in aleksovski, kay j outlined the well-known “gold bar” analogy and said “[w]hat is important is to somehow give a reasonable value to all of the elements that go to making up the entirety of the marriage relationship” (at 83,443). [21] those same principles can be expressed as saying that the requirements of the section are met by approaching the assessment of contributions holistically and by analysing the nature, form, characteristics and origin of the property currently comprising that to which s 79 applies, and, in turn, analysing the nature, form and extent of the contributions (of all types) contemplated by s 79. that task is also undertaken by reference to the nature and form of the particular marriage partnership manifested by the particular circumstances of this particular marriage. is it, for example, a relationship, as deane j put it in mallett at 640-641 “...where the parties have adopted the attitude that their marriage constituted a practical union of both lives and property...” or is it, for example, a union where parties lived very separate domestic and financial lives? [22] the analysis just referred to might, obviously enough, also involve an examination of when contributions were made and the use made of contributions. but that is quite different to attributing to, or searching for, a necessary causal connection between contributions and the available property as a requirement for a particular contribution having significance in the overall assessment of what is just and equitable.  ] we wish also to refer to the approach of the federal magistrate in attributing percentages to differing periods within the relationship, or types of contribution made. there is in our view little to be gained, and much to be said against, approaching the task of assessing contributions by attaching percentages to components of it. (the same, it might be said, applies to attributing a percentage to each of the relevant s 75(2) factors). [24] there can be little doubt that the classification of contributions by reference to terms such as “initial contributions”, “contributions during the relationship”, and “post-separation contributions”, can be helpful as a convenient means of giving coherent expression to the evidence in a s 79 case and to giving coherence to the nature, form and extent of the parties’ respective contributions. however, the task of assessing contributions is holistic and but part of a yet further holistic determination of what orders, if any, represent justice and equity in the particular circumstances of this particular relationship. so much is clear from the terms of s 79 itself and, in particular, s 79(2). the essential task is to assess the nature, form and extent of the contributions of all types made by each of the parties within the context of an analysis of their particular relationship. [25] doing so is also consistent with the demands of authority that the ultimate assessment of contributions should be made without “...giving over-zealous attention to the ascertainment of the parties’ contributions...” (norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513 at 524) and the well-established recognition in the authorities (acknowledged specifically by her honour in this case) that the process required of the court by s 79 is the exercise of a wide discretion, not the performance of a mathematical or accounting exercise. [26] the necessarily imprecise “wide discretion” inherent in what is required by the section is made no more precise or coherent by attributing percentage figures to arbitrary time frames or categorisations of contributions within the relationship. indeed, we consider that doing so is contrary to the holistic analysis required by the section and, in the usual course of events, should be avoided.
the consideration of the relevant matters referred to in s.75(2) of the act, pursuant to s.79(4), like the assessment of contributions, is holistic. also, like the assessment of contributions, it is not an accounting exercise.
the reference to "financial resources" in the context of s.75(2)(b) has long been correctly interpreted by the family court to refer to "a source of financial support which a party can reasonably expect will be available to him or her to supply a financial need or deficiency". the requirement that the financial resource be that "of" a party no doubt implies that the source of financial support be one on which the party is capable of drawing. it must involve something more than an expectation of benevolence on the part of another. but it goes too far to suggest that the party must control the source of financial support...
section 75(2)(o) plainly extends to any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account as showing that a party to the marriage is or is not able to pay spousal maintenance or is or is not able to support himself or herself. the paragraph has accordingly long been correctly interpreted by the family court as permitting consideration by a court of "all of the financial matters which are relevant to [a] particular case". nothing in the language or structure of s.75 prevents a fact or circumstance which falls within s.75(2)(o) being also a fact or circumstance which gives rise to a matter under another paragraph of s.75(2), including s.75(2)(b).  ] ... however if, as here, one party fails to fulfil that obligation, is it open to that party then to rely on the absence of satisfactory evidence to prevent the making of an order against him or her which otherwise justice and equity would require? it would be simple, if that were the case, to evade the jurisdiction of this court, not by outright refusal which would attract sanctions but by obfuscation and evasion.’ [70] it seems to us that once it has been established that there has been a deliberate non-disclosure, which follows from his honour's findings in this case, then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. to do otherwise might be thought to provide a charter for fraud in proceedings of this nature.

[57] if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. [58] if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post-separation income or acquisitions. [59] outstanding legal fees themselves are generally not taken into account as a liability. [60] if in the exercise of the discretion, it is determined that legal fees already paid should be taken into account as a notional asset, then normally any liability associated with the acquisition of the monies used to pay the legal fees should also be taken into account.  ] if, contrary to the demands of that section, there is to be a payment of costs, the award is dependent upon a finding of justifying circumstances which, in turn, is dependent upon (non-exhaustive) considerations all of which are informed by antecedent events - for example, whether one party has been “wholly unsuccessful” and “the conduct of the parties to the proceedings”. an award of the costs of trial, if any, is in the usual run of events made after the respective entitlements of the parties to a settlement of property have been assessed and, importantly, any awarded costs are paid from the assessed entitlement to property received by the paying party. [39] as has been said, legitimate guidelines “guide the exercise of a discretion”, they do not replace it. guidelines, must “[preserve], so far as it is possible to do so, the capacity ... to do justice according to the needs of the individual case”. the decision to addback or not addback paid legal fees remains a matter of discretion. but, a finding that it is just and equitable to not addback an amount of legal fees so paid is a finding that it is just and equitable for the other party to contribute to the costs of the first party in that proportion as part of an overall assessment of the justice and equity governing their property division. [40] the considerations just referred to are plainly always important and central to the exercise of that discretion in respect of paid legal fees. [41] the passages from nhc & rch, quoted above, draw a distinction between legal costs met from property that would otherwise be available at trial and legal costs met from funds “generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)”. the proposition there advanced, that such expenditure “would generally not be added back”, also needs to be seen as a guideline informing the relevant discretion rather than determining it. a further distinction is suggested in nhc & rch between funds generated in that manner and “[f]unds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement”. [42] the latter suggestion recognises the discretion inherent in the task and also, perhaps, that in the particular circumstances of a case, adding back sums generated post-separation in the different manners suggested might create injustice as much as it might cure it.   $9,950, drawn from the suburb p property mortgage between february and march 2021, (b) $10,000 from the sale of motor vehicle 2, which funds were used, according to the husband’s unchallenged oral evidence, for funds to establish himself in rental accommodation. this should be dealt with immediately. this sum does not figure remotely in any of the categories referred to in the authorities mentioned. in fact, “living expenses” are specifically excluded. the claim for this sum, a very modest one, should not have been made, and (c) $66,293 which was withdrawn in early 2023. it was a sum received by the husband following the conclusion of his employment relating to annual leave and long-service entitlements. on the basis of gollings & scott, above, the funds have clearly been received long after separation. as such, there is no need for any relevant “accounting” to the wife. what the husband does with his post-separation funds is a matter for him. the same basic principle applies also to any such income or funds received by the wife.   $10,000 from the sale of motor vehicle 2, which funds were used, according to the husband’s unchallenged oral evidence, for funds to establish himself in rental accommodation. this should be dealt with immediately. this sum does not figure remotely in any of the categories referred to in the authorities mentioned. in fact, “living expenses” are specifically excluded. the claim for this sum, a very modest one, should not have been made, and (c) $66,293 which was withdrawn in early 2023. it was a sum received by the husband following the conclusion of his employment relating to annual leave and long-service entitlements. on the basis of gollings & scott, above, the funds have clearly been received long after separation. as such, there is no need for any relevant “accounting” to the wife. what the husband does with his post-separation funds is a matter for him. the same basic principle applies also to any such income or funds received by the wife.   $66,293 which was withdrawn in early 2023. it was a sum received by the husband following the conclusion of his employment relating to annual leave and long-service entitlements. on the basis of gollings & scott, above, the funds have clearly been received long after separation. as such, there is no need for any relevant “accounting” to the wife. what the husband does with his post-separation funds is a matter for him. the same basic principle applies also to any such income or funds received by the wife.
summary: issues of non-disclosure & supplementary matters
... you recognise this is a costs agreement ‑ ‑ ‑?‑‑‑yes. ‑ ‑ ‑ and costs disclosure between you and your – actually, it’s between – sorry – [mr ff]?‑‑‑yes. and your instructing solicitor’s firm?‑‑‑mmm. and who is [mr ff]?‑‑‑he’s my – he’s my boss – my big boss, if you like to say, yes. and has he been paying your legal fees to date in this – in your matter?‑‑‑correct. are you required to pay back any money – to him?‑‑‑well, there’s no – there’s no agreement in that yet. like, i believe not. yes. so – i will leave it. his honour: we should all be so fortunate?‑‑‑yes, i’m very lucky – extremely.
i am seeking to re-open the cross-examination of the mother/wife. in re-examine – i’ve given notice, but only, to be fair, recently, as my friends only arrived recently, but the – in re-examination, she gave evidence for the first time that her legal fees are being paid for by a third party. there is, of course, an obligation on parties of full and frank disclosure and we say that has never been advised to us. the financial statements of parties include a section that says:
expenses paid for by others.
there is nothing in any of the financial statements that the mother has filed. costs notices in property matters are to include the source of funds. the costs notices do not refer to this any way. there is a vague, in a couple of them, reference to about six different potential sources of the payment of fees, but none specifically saying, “the whole of the fees are being paid for by a third party” and, in this case, not even expected to be repaid. so i seek leave to re-open just on that topic. his honour: i was going to recall the mother anyway because i had a question not on that anyway. mr howard: thank you. his honour: so did anyone wish to say anything further? ms abdelraheem: i will just say i’m instructed to object to my learned friend recalling the mother in relation to that point. we – we’ve provided the costs agreement yesterday, we’re not contending that, you know, the money that is paid on her behalf is, you know, a debt or a liability on the balance sheet. it really has no bearing in relation to ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: but why ‑ ‑ ‑ ms abdelraheem: the ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: but sorry, why isn’t it at least in some way a consideration or a matter of evidence, one way or the other, that there’s a financier [sic: “financial”] source available to one party that’s not available to the other? ms abdelraheem: in relation to legal fees? his honour: yes. ms abdelraheem: we don’t dispute that. so i ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: no, no. i know, but i mean it would just – it’s just an unusual circumstance to have such a benefaction, so to speak, which had not previously been disclosed. ms abdelraheem: i’m not really sure why it has not been disclosed. i know that there are costs notices [a]plenty that have been filed during these proceedings. i don’t have those instructions.   janzen], yesterday in re-examination, so questioning from your counsel, it was disclosed that you have an arrangement that your boss is paying your legal fees?‑‑‑yes. and that it’s not expected that you will pay that back?‑‑‑that hasn’t been – i wouldn’t think so. no. okay?‑‑‑okay. and has that ‑ ‑ ‑?‑‑‑it ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: so – sorry. so there has never been any discussion or he just said like, you know ‑ ‑ ‑?‑‑‑there has been a discussion. they’re well and truly supporting me in everything at the moment and they said ‑ ‑ ‑ well, i gathered that?‑‑‑yes. yes?‑‑‑and so they are paying the fees. saying that, i have paid some things as well so they are taking the bulk of it, obviously, which is very generous, but i have paid things as well along that. so they haven’t totally paid every single cent, but they’ve paid the bulk of it. i have paid filings and other things as well. so did you ask or ‑ ‑ ‑?‑‑‑no. ‑ ‑ ‑ they just simply volunteered and said ‑ ‑ ‑?‑‑‑no. ‑ ‑ ‑ like, here’s a blank cheque?‑‑‑no. they actually come – i was actually with another group and they actually came to me and said if you change then this is what we’re going to do for you. mr howard: wow. his honour: curious and curiouser?‑‑‑mmm.
disclosure: rules of court
disclosure: case law
ms abdelraheem: so your questions, your honour, just to clarify is the relationship. i believe you asked about the nature of the – not relationship. sorry. yes. my client’s boss had agreed to pay my client’s legal fees. it doesn’t include all disbursements. the agreement is that he is – he can pull out at any time. he can withdraw his consent. he is not – he has not indicated that he will be funding any appeal. he is not paying for any other legal fees on behalf of my client. i think there was ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: right. and then there was the question of, as it were, the reporting ‑ ‑ ‑ ms abdelraheem: yes. his honour: ‑ ‑ ‑ back to the ‑ ‑ ‑ ms abdelraheem: there is ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: ‑ ‑ ‑ father. ms abdelraheem: ‑ ‑ ‑ no reporting, at all. his – the relationship is essentially just to pay the legal fees. and he can receive notice of what those fees are – or an estimate. sorry, he receives estimates. his honour: but, like, how are they paid? i mean, you know the lawyers are simply sending an account to him? or does it go via the mother? or how does it happen, just as a matter of logistics? ms abdelraheem: it goes to him directly. his honour: directly. ms abdelraheem: directly. his honour: and would that show how many personnel are attending, from the lawyer’s office at any one time? you know, whether it’s two, three lawyers, or others attending. you know, will there be a breakdown in a – presumably, of the hourly amounts for a director, paralegal, other professional support. that would all be itemised, presumably. ms abdelraheem: yes. it is itemised in the cost agreement between the father ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: no. in the accounts. ms abdelraheem: in the accounts. i don’t have those instructions. he sees just the time entries and doesn’t see any personnel. his honour: nothing like transparency, accountability. all those sorts of things. interesting. thank you.
written submissions on behalf of the applicant in response to email from chambers of his honour judge neville dated 29 february 2024 facilitated parenting meeting the mother's application before the court, which is supported by the independent children's lawyer ("the icl"), is for the mother to have sole parental responsibility for [x]. the mother is content to consult the father via email or text message prior to exercising her parental responsibility. she does not wish to be bound to participate in a "facilitated parenting meeting" 8-12 times a year. the parties are at liberty to attend family dispute resolution or negotiate through lawyers on a case-by-case basis if and when issues arise. the mother is concerned about her safety and that a facilitated parenting meeting will have limited utility in circumstances where: the mother was subject to significant family violence from the father during their relationship and her evidence is that a dynamic of coercive control has continued post separation. the mother is concerned about the impact attending and participating in facilitated parenting meetings will have on her mental health, there is a demonstrated history of the parties being unable to agree on major long-term issues and there is a high risk that agreement will not be reached in relation to future matters, at the commencement of trial, the parties remained in significant conflict about major-long term issues including [x]'s schooling and health-related issues, care arrangements for [x] and property matters, the father was unwilling or unable, until the commencement of trial, to agree to reduce facetime (despite the mother's requests and the family report being in support of same). this should cause the court concern as to the parties' ability to make joint decisions on major-long term issues, regardless of the process they engage in, the father likely has significant personality and/or mental health issues that might require professional assistance and that are not being addressed, which could impact the utility of any facilitated parenting meeting, costs neither the father nor the icl have made an application for costs pursuant to rule 12.13(2) or 12.15(3) of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 ("the rules"). rules 12.13(1) and 12.15(3) provide that the court may make an order for costs on its own initiative. rule 12.15(1) states an order may be made where the lawyer has caused costs to be incurred by a party or another person, or to be thrown away. the mother's costs notice dated [late] 2023 states that she paid her legal fees from gifts, which is accurate given the payment of her legal fees by her employer. it also refers to her using assets, income, savings, credit cards and loans, which is accurate in circumstances where she personally paid her previous lawyers' fees and the fees relating to the family violence matter. the mother's costs notices were drafted in a similar fashion to the father's costs notices, who also received gifts from his mother for his legal fees. the mother submits that the gift from her employer is the same as a gift from a parent in circumstances where the payment of her legal fees are not a benefit from her employment and are not ongoing. further, it is submitted that the court cannot find that additional costs were incurred by a party or another person, or thrown away, as a result of the mother's financial statements and three costs notices not specifically referring to the fact that her legal fees were being paid by her employer. ... further written submissions of respondent father/husband these submissions are prepared in response to the email received from chambers on 29 february 2024 . facilitated parenting meeting it remains the father's position that it is not in the child's best interests for his time with the father to be truncated. the family report writer identified a significant number of benefits for the child to the continuation of the current arrangement. it is acknowledged communication between the parties was identified by the family report writer as an issue. in response to questions from the icl, the report writer gave evidence to the effect that "there needs to be a workable way for when issues arise and a clear blueprint about what happens [with decisions in relation to [x]]". the mother's prior conduct makes clear that the court can have little confidence the mother will meaningfully engage with or consult the father if an order for sole parental responsibility were made in her favour. the father agrees that the use of a 'facilitated parenting meeting' 2-3 times per school term, such as that proposed by the court, will assist the parties, and he would participate in that process. this supports the making of an order for shared parental responsibility. costs it is noted that there are no applications for costs on foot by either party at this stage of the proceedings . it is the father's position that any issues of costs should be reviewed by the parties post-delivery of the final parenting and property orders and reasons for judgment. notwithstanding such, under part 12.5 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021, the court may make an order for costs on its own initiative. it is submitted that the court would have regard to the conduct of the wife throughout the course of the final hearing in assessing and determining any issue of costs. there was no attempt by the wife or indeed her legal team at the commencement of her evidence in chief to correct the record in relation to her 2 financial statements and 3 costs notices, none of which referred to the fact that the wife's legal fees were being paid by her employer. specifically, under cross‑examination by counsel for the husband, the wife gave evidence that she prioritised paying her legal fees over paying the mortgage on the former family home. it was only in re-examination by the wife's counsel that it was disclosed that her legal fees were being funded by her employer. his honour re-called the wife on day 2 of the trial following this late-breaking development, and the wife further disclosed that there is no expectation of repayment to her employer of these legal fees, representing a large financial resource available to the wife which was not previously disclosed.   the husband plainly disclosed the payment of his legal fees and the source of funds for payment (from his mother), the wife did not, (b) the special costs arrangement only came to light during the wife’s re-examination. why this occurred, and what prompted it at that time, was never explained, (c) counsel for the wife confirmed in submissions that there had been lack of disclosure in relation to the wife’s special costs arrangement, and also confirmed that she did not know the reasons for this, (d) there had been two false affidavits filed (as part of the wife’s two financial statements), and four inaccurate costs notices, in none of which was there any mention, let alone complete disclosure, of the special costs arrangement on behalf of the wife between her employer and the wife’s lawyers, (e) there was no compliance with part 6.1 of the court rules in relation to disclosure on behalf of the wife, and (f) likewise, there was no compliance with principles

whereas some of the cases say that there must be "a serious dereliction of duty" by the solicitor before a costs order can be made against that solicitor, in our view the matters identified by the master of the rolls in ridehalgh v. horsefield accurately reflect the law, which, in its application to this jurisdiction, can be set out as follows: pursuant to s.117(2) family law act, the court has jurisdiction to make an order for costs against a solicitor or a non-party. the court should not make such an order without giving the person to be affected by the order an opportunity to be heard. the court may make an order for costs against a solicitor without the necessity to establish that the solicitor has been guilty of serious professional misconduct. the solicitor has a duty to the court to promote the interests of justice whilst at the same time attending to the needs of the solicitor's client. a mistake or error of judgment would not justify an order for costs against a solicitor. however, misconduct, default or negligence, any of which are found by a court to be of a serious nature, may be sufficient to justify an order. the jurisdiction is compensatory.  ] section 117(1) of the act provides: “[s]ubject to subsection (2), subsection 70nfb(1) and sections 117aa, 117ab, 117ac and 118, each party to proceedings under this act shall bear his or her own costs.” [63] section 117(2) of the act provides that if, in proceedings under the act, the court is of opinion that there are circumstances that justify it in doing so, it may, subject to sub-ss (2a), (4) and (5), and the applicable rules, make such order as to costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, as it considers just. [64] section 117(2a) of the act provides that in considering what order (if any) should be made under s 117(2), the court shall have regard to the matters set out in paragraphs (a) to (g). in fitzgerald (as child representative for a (legal aid commission of tasmania)) v fish and another [2005] famca 158, (2005) 33 fam lr 123 the full court (kay, warnick and boland jj), referring to s 117(2a), said at 130 [41]:
a number of factors are then listed in the subparagraphs. the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings is the first mentioned factor. nowhere in subs (2a) or elsewhere in s 117, is there any prescription that more than one factor must be present before an order for costs is made nor of comparative weight of the factors set out in subs (2a). as a consequence, there is nothing to prevent any factor being the sole foundation for an order for costs.  ] as to the relationship between s 117(1) and s 117(2) of the act in penfold v penfold (1980) 144 clr 311, in joint reasons, stephen, mason, aickin and wilson jj said at 315:
it is an accurate description of s. 117 (1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the sub-section is not paramount to s. 117 (2). as sub-s. (1) is expressed to be subject to sub-s. (2) the former must yield whenever a judge finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. sub-section (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs. consequently, with respect to their honours in the family court, we do not agree with the suggestion made in the judgment under appeal that an order can only be made under s. 117 (2) in “a clear case”. (emphasis added)  ] as to the nature of the hearing of an application pursuant to s 117 of the act in penfold their honours said at 315-16:
sub-section (2) does not in our view as a matter of law require the judge to specify the circumstances which justify the making of an order. it does not expressly say so, and in the context of the making of an order for costs there is no sufficient basis for making an implication. judges very frequently make orders for costs without giving reasons or making findings, even when costs are in issue. the absence of reasons or findings does not in itself indicate that a judge has erroneously exercised his discretion to award costs, though it will place an appellate court in the position of examining the circumstances and of determining for itself whether the circumstances show that the discretion was erroneously exercised (kent v. kent [(1970) 92 w.n. (nsw) 503, at p. 505]). accordingly, in the absence of some positive legislative indication we should not attribute to parliament the requirement that a judge must make particular findings in relation to an order for costs.  ] we also observe that in re jjt, ex parte victoria legal aid (1998) 195 clr 184 the majority of the high court (gaudron, gummow, hayne and callinan jj, kirby j dissenting) held that s 117(2) of the act referred to costs in the conventional sense and thus to the payment by one party to litigation of money by way of a partial indemnity for professional legal fees and expenses actually incurred by another party in the course of the litigation: see hayne j at 219. an order for costs is made to compensate a party against expense incurred in litigation and is not punitive in nature. costs are not a penalty or damages: latoudis v casey [1990] hca 59, (1990) 170 clr 534 per mason cj at 543 and mchugh j at 567, ruddock and ors v vadarlis and ors (2001) 188 alr 143 per full court of the federal court at [12] and brott and joachim [2006] famca 256, (2006) flc 93-259 per full court (holden, warnick and boland jj) at 80,403-404.
an order for costs may be made on an indemnity basis, subject to a judicial determination capable of being made that there ought to be a departure from the usual basis that costs be payable on the party and party basis. for a discussion of the jurisdiction to order indemnity costs and its exercise see colgate palmolive co and another v cussons pty ltd (1993) 118 alr 248 per sheppard j at 256-257 and nmfm property pty ltd and others v citibank ltd (no 2) (court’s “nmfm” judgment no 11) [2011] fca 480, (2001) 109 fcr 77 per lindgren j at [53] to [90].
it seems to me that the following principles or guidelines can be distilled out of the authorities to which i have referred:-
1. the problem arises in adversary litigation, i.e. litigation as between parties at arm's length. different considerations apply where parties may be found to be entitled to the payment of their costs out of a fund or assets being administered by or under the control of a trustee, liquidator, receiver or person in a like position, eg. a government agency or statutory authority. 2. the ordinary rule is that, where the court orders the costs of one party to litigation to be paid by another party, the order is for payment of those costs on the party and party basis. in this court the provisions of order 62, rules 12 and 19, and the second schedule to the rules will apply to the taxation. in many cases the result will be that the amount recovered by the successful party under the order will fall short of (in many cases well short of) a complete indemnity. 3. this has been the settled practice for centuries in england. it is a practice which is entrenched in australia. either legislation (perhaps in the form of an amendment to rules of court) or a decision of an intermediate court of appeal or of the high court would be required to alter it. no doubt any consideration of whether there should be any change in the practice would require the resolution of the competing considerations mentioned by devlin lj in berry v. british transport commission and handley ja in cachia v. hanes on the one hand and by rogers j in qantas on the other. the relevant passages from the respective judgments have been earlier referred to. 4. in consequence of the settled practice which exists, the court ought not usually make an order for the payment of costs on some basis other than the party and party basis. the circumstances of the case must be such as to warrant the court in departing from the usual course. that has been the view of all judges dealing with applications for payment of costs on the indemnity or some other basis whether here or in england. the tests have been variously put. the court of appeal in andrews v. barnes (39 ch d at 141) said the court had a general and discretionary power to award costs as between solicitor and client "as and when the justice of the case might so require." woodward j in fountain selected meats appears to have adopted what was said by brandon lj (as he was) in preston v. preston ((1982) 1 all er at 58) namely, there should be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court in departing from the ordinary practice. most judges dealing with the problem have resolved the particular case before them by dealing with the circumstances of that case and finding in it the presence or absence of factors which would be capable, if they existed, of warranting a departure from the usual rule. but as french j said (at 8) in tetijo, "the categories in which the discretion may be exercised are not closed". davies j expressed (at 6) similar views in ragata. 5. notwithstanding the fact that that is so, it is useful to note some of the circumstances which have been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion. i instance the making of allegations of fraud knowing them to be false and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud (both referred to by woodward j in fountain and also by gummow j in thors v. weekes (1989) 92 alr 131 at 152, evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the court and to other parties (french j in tetijo), the fact that the proceedings were commenced or continued for some ulterior motive (davies j in ragata) or in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (woodward j in fountain and french j in j-corp), the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (davies j in ragata), an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg messiter v. hutchinson (1987) 10 nswlr 525, maitland hospital v. fisher (no. 2) (1992) 27 nswlr 721at 724 (court of appeal), crisp v. keng (supreme court of new south wales, 27 september 1993, unreported, court of appeal)and an award of costs on an indemnity basis against a contemnor (eg megarry v-c in emi records). other categories of cases are to be found in the reports. yet others to arise in the future will have different features about them which may justify an order for costs on the indemnity basis. the question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for payment of costs other than on a party and party basis. 6. it remains to say that the existence of particular facts and circumstances capable of warranting the making of an order for payment of costs, for instance, on the indemnity basis, does not mean that judges are necessarily obliged to exercise their discretion to make such an order. the costs are always in the discretion of the trial judge. provided that discretion is exercised having regard to the applicable principles and the particular circumstances of the instant case its exercise will not be found to have miscarried unless it appears that the order which has been made involves a manifest error or injustice.   the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters...
presentation of a false statement of financial circumstances, which puts the other party to the trouble and expense of disproving it, is a circumstance which justifies an order for costs. courts should regard such circumstances which tend to undermine the integrity of proceedings with great concern, and should do everything in their power to determine who is responsible in order to maintain that integrity.
