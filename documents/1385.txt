1. a summary as to [ms barton rr hospital] inpatient program, [ms barton’s] treatment post discharge from the [rr hospital] clinic inpatient aod program has comprised of biological, psychological and social strategies. [ms barton] has been prescribed [multiple medications]. these above psychotropic medications have been prescribed for management of [ms barton’s] depressive and anxiety symptoms. [ms barton] also completed her 12-week psychological program aimed at relapse prevention for addictive behaviours. she also completed a 12 week distress tolerance program to implement healthy coping strategies when faced with stressors. [ms barton] continues to be reviewed by myself every 6 weekly to ensure medication optimisation, stabilisation of her mental state and relapse prevention. 2. her level of engagement in her treatment, [ms barton] engages in treatment in a consistent manner and is compliant with prescribed medications. safescript has been also checked to ensure that she has only one prescriber and that she is not currently being dispensed any addictive medications. 3. the results of any examination, investigation or observation made in relation to [ms barton] by you, [ms barton’s] mental state examination showed ongoing depressive and anxiety symptoms. there were no psychotic symptoms or formal thought disorder...she showed insight into her mental illness and the need to have ongoing consistent treatment. 4. the particulars of [ms barton’s] diagnosis, [ms barton’s] symptoms are consistent with substance use disorder -remission and major depressive disorder with anxiety features, moderate subtype as per the dsm 5 diagnostic criteria. 5. a description of the treatment you have carried out or recommended to [ms barton], including medication prescribed, [ms barton] is currently prescribed [multiple medications]. these above psychotropic medications have been prescribed for management of [ms barton’s] depressive and anxiety symptoms. 6a. your opinion as to: (a) the reasons for carrying out or recommending such treatment, including the reasons for particular prescribed medication [ms barton] has been prescribed [a medication] to aid with her debilitating anxiety symptoms. additionally, [another medication] has been prescribed to be taken when [ms barton] experiences significant insomnia due to anxiety and depression. i have prescribed [ms barton other medications] due to the persistent depressive symptoms of amotivation and anhedonia. as her depressive symptoms were inadequately managed by a single antidepressant agent, a second antidepressant was added per clinical guidelines. [another medication] has been prescribed [...] to aid with [ms barton] emotional dysregulation stemming from childhood trauma. (b) [ms barton’s] prognosis including risk of relapse, given [ms barton’s] consistent engagement, the risk of her relapse remains low if she continues to comply with medications and treatment. [ms barton] urine drug screens (that were done at 24-hour request) and previous hair follicle testing have returned clear of illicit drugs. given these factors, her risk of relapse remains low.
“so for a substance use disorder it (remission) would be three months – up to three months of sobriety would be considered remission. anything from 1 year to 5 years would be sustained (remission) and anything more than 5 years is stable. so at the point of writing the affidavit, [ms barton] would have done approximately 18 month of sobriety and therefore would be considered in sustained remission according to the dsm criteria.”

a. that, [x] and [y] live mainly with their father, b. that, the children spend a minimum of four nights per fortnight with their mother, including one block of three nights (friday to monday) and a single overnight stay in the intervening week, c. that, the children spend time with each parent on a week-about basis during school holidays, when the need for organisation and routine is reduced, d. that, the children have a mechanism to contact their father should any risk scenario arise while in the care of their mother,
“i was really concerned about the dynamic and interplay between this little girl and her mum, which is on a descending trajectory. my concern, however, is if things unfold too slowly, and if there isn’t an opportunity for [ms barton] to address some of the issues that have been raised in this report – that we will get to a point where [y] is 12 or 13 where she will just refuse to go. she will exhibit resist and refuse behaviours, and she will be developmentally a little bit older and a bit more involved in wanting to assert her will with a bit more, and she will stop going...if it moves too slowly and her time with her mother remains extremely minimal, almost this kind of perfunctory add on to the rest of her life that she does reluctantly, arbitrarily, and just has to go and suck it up – if we don’t get that situation back to some semblance of normal and give her an opportunity for repair and recover of that relationship, [y] will stop going.”
“there are features of the way this person (the mother) functions, in my view that are personality bound. and that is evidenced throughout the course of their life-span. everyone is talking about adjustment disorder after the breakdown. no, no, no, no. this is far more long standing. that being the case, her capacity to fundamentally change aspects of her function is probably a little bit compromised. so, perspective taking, empathy, understanding things from [y’s] perspective, not being emotionally reactive, not withdrawing when she feels rejected. a sense of rejection is a central tenant of cluster b issues. i would posit that, unless there is some professional assistance with this little girl and her mother – a form of which they can sort of ventilate and process this stuff – the prognosis is not overly favourable.”
“the reason i advocated for a split week configuration rather than just a block of time was that these children already come from two very different parenting styles. there are issues within the relationship between [y] and her mum. and if we increase the latency between when [y] is with her mum to over 10 days rather than interrupt with that, ok, well we’re back with mum now....so my concern is that the latency would be too long, which would make it more jarring for her when she has had 10 days with her dad, she settles, she’s happy, going to sport hasn’t seen mum, and then she goes ‘do i have to?’ and doesn’t go.”
“well, four nights to five nights represents a 20% increase. so... it is not insignificant...four nights is still a significant period of time. would the children be better served by five nights? that wasn’t the view that i arrived at in june/july of this year when i was specifically trying to answer that question. i guess my concern again...we are dealing with...such fluid and complex dynamics in this matter that if...you push it out too far and...it falls too quickly, it might cross a tolerance threshold for [y], in particular, where it causes her – where it is – too psychologically onerous and, again, we get that resist/refuse phenomena starting to emerge so i thought that...the balance outlined in the june/july report was probably the most ideal solution for these two children.”
“i think that if it explained well to [y], in particular, but both to [x]... i think that if there is a mechanism for [y] and her mother to be working on their relationship with each other, there’s no reason to delay it excessively.”
“i alluded to that in my second report but didn’t offer a definitive opinion in relation to that issue other than it is entirely unrealistic to suggest that these parents are going to be able to come together, discuss, analyse, negotiate and ultimately agree on a course of action in relation to their children. i think...that’s just not going to happen. and so i think that there is merit in the position of [mr mignone] in relation to him taking carriage around decisions regarding school and extracurricular activities, because i think that, prognostically, if there does need to be major decisions around either of those two issues, these parents aren’t going to be able to resolve those, and i think that there is an established pattern in which he has made very sound decisions that have been in the best interests of these children over the last couple of years where they lived almost exclusively in his care.”

“there has been a lot of dialogue today about the relationship between [y] and her mum. it’s not an abject disaster. it’s not. and i saw them playing somewhat happily and contentedly together ... when i did the observation. there ...is a level of fragility to that relationship, and there are markers that it could rapidly deteriorate. but currently, there are some positive features to it, as well. so i did want to make that point. i was reflecting on my evidence earlier, and it would be unfair and injudicious of me to create a narrative for the court that the relationship is entirely and irretrievably broken. it’s not at this point.”
“there needs to be a tariff placed on the importance of this same-gendered child having a relationship with her mum...she’s coming into some rough seas ahead, being the... precarious teenage years, and she needs her mum in her life if we want to get her to a 25 year old that has had a fully-formed... developmentally normal... experience...we’ve got to think about the grown-up that she’s going to become. and that’s why i think that there needs to be a real effort to get things back on track... the benefits that will flow to this child by having her mum and her dad in her life will make her a more well-formed human as an adult.”

for a resulting trust to arise the purchase money must have been provided by the purchaser with the character of purchase money (i.e. not as a loan) [see calverley v green at [246] (per gibbs cj)]. a person’s beneficial interest under a resulting trust is determined by the person’s direct financial contribution to the purchase price at the time the property is purchased and the trust created [see calverley v green at [252] (per gibbs cj), sivritas v sivratas [2008] vsc 580, (2008) 23 vr 349 (“sivritas v sivratas”) at 372 (per kyrou j).
a beneficial interest arising by way of resulting trust will not be established by contributions other than contributions to the purchase price. money subsequently expended on outgoings or improvements will not alter the beneficial interest of contributors under a resulting trust that is already in existence: see sivritas v sivratas at 373 (per kyrou j).

add-backs
the treatment of property already distributed and exhausted prior to trial, usually called “add backs”, has been the subject of many authorities in this court. in [ajo & gro] [2005] famcafc 104, (2005) flc 93-218 at [30] (“[ajo & gro]”), following kowaliw & kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 and townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 (“townsend”), the full court held that addbacks fall into “three clear categories”: where the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and “waste” or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets. this latter category indicates that the nature of the expenditure of post-separation or premature distributions can be relevant to the exercise of discretion to add back.   where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) flc 92-816 the full court said at 85,262:
“11.6 for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out.”
in our view, these authorities establish four relevant propositions. first, adding back property which has been distributed and spent is discretionary, and reflects an exceptional exercise of the discretion as an “accounting” or “balance sheet” exercise for the purposes of ss 79(2) and (4) to achieve justice and equity between the parties. secondly, the nature of the expenditure reflected in add backs is relevant, and reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback. thirdly, the decision in stanford, followed by bevan, does not necessarily require the conclusion that adding back notional property is per se an error, but proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property. fourthly, in cases which are not exceptional, expended interim distributions can be taken up under s 75(2) rather than as part of the balance sheet exercise.
p business
14. counsel for the husband argued before us that if it could be seen that the profit was generated not by the husband’s efforts but by the business itself then the wife, having received her share of the business by way of capital adjustment ought not be seen to be entitled to receive a further adjustment because the retention by the husband of the business left him in a stronger position to generate income:
“notionally a line should have been drawn across the page at the date of the judgment. from there on it was up to each party what he or she did with the appropriate share of net property awarded to him/her. if the wife chooses to invest in residential property...with its greater security and perhaps upside for capital growth but smaller return it is unfair that the husband should in effect subsidise that decision. if the husband earns at a higher rate from his assets tied up in the business it is because those assets are at greater risk. this [is] a fundamental of the correlation between risk and return and the assessment of the risk is represented by the capitalisation rate used for the assets in this case the business. valuation of the assets is a function of that capitalisation rate...”
the profit making capacity of the business was already factored into the valuation, and i perceive there is an element of double dipping, paying attention to the income it earnt. if the wife sold the business, she lost her greater earning capacity. accordingly, whilst its value was appropriately included in the pool of divisible assets, the fact that she will be required to buy out the husband's half share immediately compensates him for that difference, while increasing her outgoings by borrowings necessary to finance the purchase. once that factor is recognised, there is really very little difference between the parties' positions.
