$ 2,803,985   per original)   the country g property is registered in the husband’s name as the proprietor, (b) the wife’s detailed evidence, inter alia, that in or around 2015 the parties began looking at another investment to purchase, the husband had been earning substantial income from his employment in australia at the time and they had accumulated quite a lot of savings, the parties discussing the possibility of running a business in australia however it seemed this project would be too expensive for them, the parties looking at whether it was practical to establish a business in country g, the parties discussing the possibility of purchasing some land and building a holiday rental property on the land, the parties discussing and settling on the name for the property being u business, the parties discussing the sorts of features they thought the property should have, and the husband locating a parcel of land in town j, (c) the wife’s evidence that she discovered in her records since commencement of these proceedings a copy of an unsigned sales agreement which she asserts relates to the above land that the husband located as an investment in or around 2015. the sales agreement, annexure f to the wife’s affidavit, states the purchaser is the husband, and the property to be purchased is several acres to be excised from the property known as 5 f street, the sales agreement being drawn up by a law firm (in city s) and the sales agreement providing for the purchaser to pay for, inter alia, legal fees for administration of the sale agreement, the sales agreement refers to the vendors being two persons including one “mr v” which person is expressly mentioned on the country g subdivision form set out at page 18 of the valuation report as being a person interested in the “registered proprietors’ instructions to the surveyor”. the court has approached this unsigned sales agreement with some caution, however, it would appear to be consistent with later evidence, for example, exhibit i (see below) and a letter dated early 2019 and titled “re: boundary dispute” (exhibit s), (d) exhibit i, being extracts from a joint bank account of the parties, account ...73, showing an early 2016 payment of $500 to the above advocates, (e) by reference to the above valuation report, an annexed subdivision record carrying dates of late 2018 refers to 5 f street being subdivided as to, inter alia, a block of several acres, and a further subdivision related document dated late 2018 headed “field diagram and observations on-site” refers to this block of land and which looks similar in shape and alignment to the google map set out at page 15 of the valuation report, (f) the wife’s evidence that shortly after the parties arrived in country g the construction process for the above residential house (on 3 f street) started, and her evidence in this context that one of the early tasks that was performed was the drilling of a borehole for access to water, (g) the wife’s evidence annexing the borehole completion records showing borehole works completed on about mid-2019, with those records showing the husband as the applicant for the borehole, (h) exhibit r, being a copy of a funds transfer bank record from the parties joint l bank account ... dated late 2019 (page 22 of wife’s tender bundle) referring to a payment of money relating to a borehole after the borehole work was carried out, (i) the wife’s evidence that a housewarming and blessing for the newly constructed house was held on about late 2019, which had been arranged by the husband, and that it was lovely to be able to show off the parties’ new home to their friends and family, (j) the certificate of official search relating to 1 f street and which relates to the land on which the holiday rental is built, and set out at page 20 of the valuation report, refers to two charges (early 2022) in favour of the l bank of country g, in the sum of about $150,000. it also refers to the husband being the “proprietor” of that land. it refers to a title deed issuing for that land in late 2021. in cross-examination, the husband confirmed that he did sign documents with that bank with his father present.   the wife’s detailed evidence, inter alia, that in or around 2015 the parties began looking at another investment to purchase, the husband had been earning substantial income

there is force to the submission of the wife that, on the assumption that the husband’s trust contention is truthful, it is likely that at about the time that this bank advanced funds totalling $150,000 on the security of title to the above land, the husband would have informed the bank that in fact his father was the beneficial owner of that land pursuant to a trust between himself and his father. in such circumstances, documentation relating to such trust would have likely formed part of the bank’s security documentation relating to its loan, it is unlikely that the bank would lend a significant sum of money to the husband, who was not the beneficial owner of the land, without such documentation. yet, the husband adduced no such documentation which (on the above assumption) could have been obtained by him from the bank, (k) exhibits p and q, in relation to the business known as the u business, country g, reveals the company h ltd being incorporated (in country g) in 2016, the ordinary shares in the company, 100, in the name of the husband as “director/shareholder”, with its registered office having an email address which is one of the husband’s email addresses, its phone number is the husband’s phone number, the business name u business, country g was registered in mid-2021 with the proprietor of that business name being the above company, and there is no reference to the husband’s father in exhibits p and q. in evidence, the husband conceded that there was no trust deed nor trust declaration showing his shares in the above company being held on trust for his father. these exhibits are consistent with the husband being the true owner of the business, with the business being a significant concern, and the court observing that the husband has provided no disclosure in relation to the operation of the business, (l) the wife’s evidence that at no time during the parties’ relationship did the parties ever discuss the husband’s father being involved in the business project that they had, (m) the husband’s inadequate financial disclosure in relation to these proceedings has been unsatisfactory and deliberate. for example, the husband failed to disclose his ownership of the country g properties, and the wife was required to engage legal assistance in country g to ascertain the husband’s property interests in country g. the husband did not disclose in a timely manner bank accounts in his name, including cba account ...51, and l bank account ...96 (a bank account in country g), and they were not disclosed in his financial statement filed 19 december 2022. cba account ...51 was only discovered by the wife’s side after a subpoena was issued to the cba bank. some elaboration of these matters can now be given. the husband’s solicitors’ letter dated 9 september 2022 to the wife’s solicitors stated, inter alia, that the husband does not hold any significant interest in property in country g, and that he had not purchased any plots of land in country g. this letter was in response to the wife’s solicitors’ letter dated 8 july 2022. the wife’s solicitors’ letter to the husband’s solicitors dated 28 march 2023 again sought disclosure as to property owned by the husband in country g. the husband’s solicitors’ letter in response dated 17 april 2023 stated, inter alia, “as previously stated our client [the husband] instructs that he does not hold any significant interests in property in country g”. on about 28 july 2023, the wife’s solicitors received a report from advocates in country g stating, inter alia, that they had traced three properties held in the name of the husband in country g (being the properties referred to in items 16, 17 and 18 in the joint balance sheet). it was not until an interim hearing held in this court on 20 november 2023 that the husband disclosed for the first time that he was alleging that the land in country g, being the land set out in items 16, 17 and 18 in the joint balance sheet, was held on trust for his father. the court refers to the wife’s evidence in her affidavit filed 16 february 2024 under the heading, “attempts to obtain disclosure of [country g] property”. a further example of non-financial disclosure in relation to these proceedings related to the husband’s bank accounts only revealed to the wife’s side after the cba bank had produced documents to the court under subpoena. these bank accounts revealed significant banking transactions carried out by the husband and which are summarised, in part, in exhibit o. in this context, the court refers to the wife’s evidence in her above affidavit under the heading, “subpoenae [sic] to commonwealth bank of australia”. the court further refers to the wife’s evidence in her above affidavit under the heading, “[mr senga’s] financial disclosure”. the court is entitled, pursuant to established legal authority, e.g. weir & weir [1992] famca 69, (1993) 16 flr 154, to not be unduly cautious in making findings

for example, the husband failed to disclose his ownership of the country g properties, and the wife was required to engage legal assistance in country g to ascertain the husband’s property interests in country g. the husband did not disclose in a timely manner bank accounts in his name, including cba account ...51, and l bank account ...96 (a bank account in country g), and they were not disclosed in his financial statement filed 19 december 2022. cba account ...51 was only discovered by the wife’s side after a subpoena was issued to the cba bank. some elaboration of these matters can now be given. the husband’s solicitors’ letter dated 9 september 2022 to the wife’s solicitors stated, inter alia, that the husband does not hold any significant interest in property in country g, and that he had not purchased any plots of land in country g. this letter was in response to the wife’s solicitors’ letter dated 8 july 2022. the wife’s solicitors’ letter to the husband’s solicitors dated 28 march 2023 again sought disclosure as to property owned by the husband in country g. the husband’s solicitors’ letter in response dated 17 april 2023 stated, inter alia, “as previously stated our client [the husband] instructs that he does not hold any significant interests in property in country g”. on about 28 july 2023, the wife’s solicitors received a report from advocates in country g stating, inter alia, that they had traced three properties held in the name of the husband in country g (being the properties referred to in items 16, 17 and 18 in the joint balance sheet). it was not until an interim hearing held in this court on 20 november 2023 that the husband disclosed for the first time that he was alleging that the land in country g, being the land set out in items 16, 17 and 18 in the joint balance sheet, was held on trust for his father. the court refers to the wife’s evidence in her affidavit filed 16 february 2024 under the heading, “attempts to obtain disclosure of [country g] property”. a further example of non-financial disclosure in relation to these proceedings related to the husband’s bank accounts only revealed to the wife’s side after the cba bank had produced documents to the court under subpoena. these bank accounts revealed significant banking transactions carried out by the husband and which are summarised, in part, in exhibit o. in this context, the court refers to the wife’s evidence in her above affidavit under the heading, “subpoenae [sic] to commonwealth bank of australia”. the court further refers to the wife’s evidence in her above affidavit under the heading, “[mr senga’s] financial disclosure”. the court is entitled, pursuant to established legal authority, e.g. weir & weir [1992] famca 69, (1993) 16 flr 154, to not be unduly cautious in making findings in favour of the innocent party, here the wife.
