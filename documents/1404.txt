background
14. the parties commenced cohabitation in 2019. the parties separated for a short period of time [in late] 2020. during the period of separation, the mother was sexually intimate with the second respondent, [mr e]. 17. in 2020:
a. the mother discovered she was pregnant, the mother informed the applicant she was pregnant but there was a possibility he was not the biological father of the child, and c. the mother and the applicant resumed their relationship. the parties were married [in] 2022 and, after a relationship of approximately four (4) years, separated on a final basis in or around february 2023.
19. the parties are not divorced. 20. the applicant has re-partnered since separation. 21. the mother has re-partnered since separation. the applicant conducted a paternity test [in] 2023 without the mother’s knowledge. the parties participated in a mediation [in mid]-2023 and reached agreement with respect to parenting arrangements for [x]. 24. at the time of the mediation: the mother believed the applicant to be the child’s biological father, the mother was not aware the applicant had taken a paternity test, and
c. the applicant had not received the results of the paternity test. the parties entered into a parenting plan at mediation [in mid]-2023 which provided for, among other things: a. the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility for [x], and [x] to live with the parties on a week about basis with changeover to occur every friday morning at 8am. the applicant received the paternity test results [in] 2023 that he was not the biological father of [x]. the applicant disclosed the paternity test results to the mother [in] 2023. the mother resigned from her job at [f company] [in] 2023.
29. the parties engaged in a heated interaction [in mid]- 2023. on 28 july 2023, the mother informed, via her legal representative, that she did not agree to continue to honour the parenting plan having regard to the attitude of the applicant and his family towards the mother, and instead proposed that the applicant spend time with [x] each alternate weekend while she considered what arrangements would best serve [x]. on 30 july 2023, the applicant, via his legal representative, rejected the mother’s proposal to reduce time and sought that the week-about arrangement continue. 32. on 11 august 2023, the mother did not facilitate changeover of [x]. on 24 august 2023, the applicant commenced urgent proceedings in the federal circuit and family court of australia seeking, amongst other things, that [x] live with the parties on an equal week-about arrangement. the mother and the applicant have not seen each other face-to-face since the incident [in mid]-2023. the applicant has not spent time with [x] since [mid]-2023, save for a short time during family report interviews. the mother contacted [x]’s biological applicant, [mr e], and he submitted to a dna paternity test which confirmed, [in late] 2023, with 99.9% accuracy that he was [x]’s biological applicant. the parties agreed to a family report being conducted and provided joint instructions, via their respective legal representatives, to family report writer, [mr g], [in late] 2023. the parties participated in family report interviews with [mr g] [in late] 2023. on 21 november 2023, the applicant filed an amended initiating application with court, joining [x]’s biological applicant is [mr e], to the proceedings as second respondent. 40. [in late 2023], [mr e] released his family report. 41. to date, [mr e] has not participated in these proceedings. 42. [x] has never met nor has any knowledge of [mr e]. [in early] 2024, the applicant enrolled in a men’s behavioural intervention program at the [h centre]. the applicant undertook hair follicle drug testing [in early] 2024 which returned a negative result for all substances [in early] 2024.[5]
the father’s submissions
the mother’s submissions
... there are question of family violence. elements within the history imply that [ms tate] was controlled and isolated and that [mr galvan] was verbally abusive.[14]
the law
as has frequently been emphasised interim parenting proceedings, and orders made as a consequence, are a necessary but temporary measure until all the evidence can be tested, evaluated and weighed at a final hearing by the making of final parenting orders. decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires, or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing (s 61db).[15]
in our view, findings made at an interim hearing should be couched with great circumspection, no matter how firmly a judge’s intuition may suggest that the finding will be borne out after a full testing of the evidence.[16]
the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.[17]
as would be immediately apparent, this approach enables the court to appropriately and carefully deal with contentious issues relevant to the welfare of the child, and for those issues to not be ignored.[18]
parental responsibility
x’s best interests: the s 60cc factors
section 60cc(2)(a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents
what these definitions convey is that "meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[20]
it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[21]
section 60cc(2)(b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[27]
11. in summary, the mother deposes to: (a) the applicant telling mutual friends, family and unknown third parties in the [town f] community (which has a [small] population) about the paternity test results prior to informing the mother about the results, (b) the applicant and his parents speaking loudly about the child’s paternity at [f company] (the mother’s place of work) so others could easily overhear, leading to the mother feeling forced to resign from her position due to the anxiety, shame and humiliation caused by the applicant and his parents, (c) the applicant verbally abusing the mother at changeover (in the presence and hearing of the child) telling her: “i fucking hate you cunt you’re a bitch” and “that’s what you get for letting every cunt blow in you!”. (d) the mother being concerned for her, and the child’s, safety in the presence of the applicant such that she felt it necessary to report his behaviour to the police, and (e) the applicant’s lack of discretion regarding the paternity test results and his continued denigration of her which has resulted in the mother being referred to as a “liar” and a “slut” in the [town f] community (where the applicant continues to reside and seeks to spend time with the child).[30]   the applicant telling mutual friends, family and unknown third parties in the [town f] community (which has a [small] population) about the paternity test results prior to informing the mother about the results, (b) the applicant and his parents speaking loudly about the child’s paternity at [f company] (the mother’s place of work) so others could easily overhear, leading to the mother feeling forced to resign from her position due to the anxiety, shame and humiliation caused by the applicant and his parents, (c) the applicant verbally abusing the mother at changeover (in the presence and hearing of the child) telling her: “i fucking hate you cunt you’re a bitch” and “that’s what you get for letting every cunt blow in you!”.
