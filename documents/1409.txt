the father’s position
i did not gain confidence from the session that i would derive any benefit from coparenting issues, which was what i had agreed to.[38]
...feelings of hurt as to the loss of my marriage did initially impact upon my attitude towards the mother’s partner. i have sought to address those feelings of loss and grief with the assistance of my medical advisors. i have moved on from this and those feelings are not the motivation for the concerns i have for the children.[42]   the father and x attended upon dr o, medical practitioner. x was interviewed about mr b. a letter from dr o dated early 2024 is annexure ‘m-20’ to the father’s affidavit filed 26 march 2024, (b) the father attended at the suburb f police station in early 2024 and made a report of x’ s allegations. the father and x were interviewed by police on two occasions. sapol have informed the father that they intend to take no further action at this time,[48] and (c) the father attended with x at the office of his solicitor so that the father provided instructions for the letter of 8 march 2024. the father says through his counsel that x waited in a motor vehicle in an underground carpark while he saw mr sloan.   the father attended at the suburb f police station in early 2024 and made a report of x’ s allegations. the father and x were interviewed by police on two occasions. sapol have informed the father that they intend to take no further action at this time,[48] and (c) the father attended with x at the office of his solicitor so that the father provided instructions for the letter of 8 march 2024. the father says through his counsel that x waited in a motor vehicle in an underground carpark while he saw mr sloan.   the father attended with x at the office of his solicitor so that the father provided instructions for the letter of 8 march 2024. the father says through his counsel that x waited in a motor vehicle in an underground carpark while he saw mr sloan.
the independent children’s lawyer’s position
legal principles  the benefit to the child having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (2) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.[52]   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.[52]
the court’s duty is to deliver individual justice, for the child affected, in every case.[54]   any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child's views, (b) the nature of the relationship of the child with:   each of the child's parents, and (ii) other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child),   the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:   to participate in making decisions about major long - term issues in relation to the child, and (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  ) the extent to which each of the child's parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent's obligations to maintain the child, (d) the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:   either of his or her parents, or (ii) any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living,   the capacity of:   each of the child's parents, and (ii) any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child),
to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs, (g) the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child's parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant, (i) the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, (j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family, (l) whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child,   for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family (the family member) (emphasis added), or causes the family member to be fearful. (2) examples of behaviour that may constitute family violence include (but are not limited to):   an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or (d) repeated derogatory taunts, or (e) intentionally damaging or destroying property, or (f) intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, or (g) unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member's family, of his or her liberty.   for the purposes of this act, a child is exposed to family violence if the child sees or hears family violence or otherwise experiences the effects of family violence.
conclusions
interim living arrangements  the parties agree that the strict terms of paragraph 2 (week about care) of the heads of agreement have broken down. the father asserts he was abiding by x’s wishes in attempting to implement a “9/5” arrangement and by not following the terms agreed upon by the parties. arguably, he also failed to abide by paragraph 11 of the heads of agreement by this conduct. he was wrong to not discuss any proposed variation with the mother to obtain her consent. failing her agreement, the father could have filed an application seeking relief from the court. he did not do so, (b) only the mother implemented the “myfamilywizard” parenting app to assist the parties in their communication as per paragraph 3 of the heads of agreement. the father alleges he had trouble downloading the app on his telephone. nearly two years later, the parties have been unable to agree a parenting app to assist in their communication, (c) the father only enrolled in the parenting course d program in early 2024 as per paragraph 4 of the heads of agreement. he was required to do so within 21 days, (d) the parties have not organised psychological treatment for the children as they had agreed as per paragraph 6 of the heads of agreement, (e) the father attended only one session with dr h who was to assist the parties to improve their communication and reducing their conflict and to work towards providing the children with a “safe and supportive environment.” the co-parenting counselling never happened as set out in paragraph 7 of the heads of agreement, (f) the
