available evidence
mr h reports
dr p report
...a number of unhelpful personality traits. i note a history of anger and difficulties managing it ([mr h] refers to this). he seemed very angry when i saw him and he was generally suspicious of people involved in the court process.[7]
even though [mr madar] does not meet the diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric diagnosis i recommend he see [mr h] or a psychologist with expertise in helping people manage angry feelings.[8]
i note [mr madar]’s anger appears to have been at its peak in the week after the separation. during this time he did and said some unhelpful things. the facebook post that he made indicates he had difficulty managing anger and that he was vindictive. in my opinion, based on [mr madar]’s history, there is a low probability that [mr madar] would act out angry impulses that would create an unsafe situation for [x]. it would be appropriate for [mr madar] to have additional therapy and as he makes progress, time spending with [x] could be increased.[9]
if, the decision-maker, determines that [mr madar] did abuse [ms mccormack] and if the decision-maker determines that [mr madar] did drive with [x] in the car when [mr madar] was under the influence of alcohol or cannabis, then a longer period of supervised time spending would be appropriate.[10]
children’s contact centre report   ran to [mr madar] with open arms. [mr madar] greeted him with the same enthusiasm and they embraced... the father and son then engaged in play together in a very natural and familiar way.[11]
child impact report   felt sufficiently comfortable with the mother, her partner and [mr madar]. in this short observation timeframe, there was nothing immediately obvious in the interactions to suggest fearfulness or dysregulation in the presence of those adult caregivers.[12]
...also important consideration developmentally for [x] is that his relationship with his father has been under supervision for most of his life. for the purpose of this report, [mr madar] and [x] were in a room without a visible supervisor for the first time since [x] was [less than one year old]. notably, [x] asked [mr madar] within two minutes of being along with his father, “where’s grandma?” (who is the supervisor for contact visits).[13]
the creation of episodic memories typically happens for developmental normal children from three years of age with prior memories lost to infantile amnesia. [x] will be three years old [soon]. this sets out a clear timeframe for [x] and a challenge for his parents going forward to create new, different and happy memories of his life in a separate family.[14]
applicable legal principles   when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.[15] (2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with the parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with the parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   family violence.[16]   when the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order.[17] (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.[18]   the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.[18]
in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.[19]   subject to subsection (5), in determining what is in the child's best interests, the court must consider the matters set out in subsections (2) and (3).[20]   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.[21]   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.[21]
in applying the considerations set out in subsection (2), the court is to give greater weight to the consideration set out in paragraph (2)(b).[22]
the extent to which each of the child's parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and to spend time with the child, and to communicate with the child.[23]
the extent to which each of the child's parents have failed to fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child.[24]
the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from: i) either of his or her parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living.[25]
practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis.[26]
evaluation
in assessing the degree of risk incumbent in any particular parenting scenario, the court must look to the degree of probability that a harmful event will occur in future and what will be its severity, to any individual, particularly any child, who will be potentially affected by it.[33]
the court is required to assess risk and put in place a proportionate response to the degree of risk involved. risk arises in every aspect of human endeavour. no individual’s life, including the life of a child, can be rendered entirely free of all risk. in this court, as in life, it is a question of balancing and assessing the degree of risk arising, on an objective basis.[35] the court is frequently called upon to assess all manner of potential risks to the children concerned in proceedings coming before it. these risks include the risk of exposing a child to a parent, who is incapacitated by the consumption of drugs or alcohol, compromised parenting, as a result of psychological illness or personality disorder, possible risks relating to the exposure of a child to an angry and unpredictable parent, the risk of a child being exposed to a parent’s sexual behaviour or more seriously the child being sexually assaulted or used as an object of sexual gratification.[36]
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.[38]   she would lose her employment, which is the first employment she has been able to secure since x’s birth.[48] (b) if she was to lose her employment she would have no means to fund any alternate accommodation.[49] (c) she is still committed to assisting mr e with their home, given that they purchased the house together as a family.[50]   if she was to lose her employment she would have no means to fund any alternate accommodation.[49] (c) she is still committed to assisting mr e with their home, given that they purchased the house together as a family.[50]   she is still committed to assisting mr e with their home, given that they purchased the house together as a family.[50]
a) the mother contended: continued residence of the children in city y, rather than town x, would cause no impediment whatsoever to the children continuing to spend the alternate weekend time with their father that they had been spending since september 2012, that by moving to city y, the mother had been able to take up employment as a resident nurse/carer, with the financial advantages of that for the children rather than her remaining reliant upon a single parent pension as she had been whilst living in town x.[52]
if the children remained living in city y, it would not be possible for them to spend substantial and significant time with him or for a shared care (week-about) arrangement to be implemented.[53]
however, it can be seen that whilst his honour considered a final trial of the issues to be necessary to determine that proposal, his honour considered that a final trial of the issues was unnecessary before the making of interim orders which fundamentally changed the children’s care arrangements to that point.[54]   the mother has been the undisputed primary caregiver of x. (b) where the mother has complied with orders of the court in relation to time spending. (c) where the mother as now obtained employment which will support her financially as an individual in the same manner as the father has achieved.   where the mother has complied with orders of the court in relation to time spending. (c) where the mother as now obtained employment which will support her financially as an individual in the same manner as the father has achieved.   where the mother as now obtained employment which will support her financially as an individual in the same manner as the father has achieved.
