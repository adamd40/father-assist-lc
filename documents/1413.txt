... i applied for mediation through [e counsellors] based on the final ivo’s conditions. i submitted my application [in early] 2023, and [e counsellors] conducted an interview with me [in early] 2023. following [e counsellor’s] process, they were supposed to interview [ms yahui] as well to understand both parties’ situation as soon as possible. by the end of march, i called [e counsellors] to inquire about the progress of the mediation, [e counsellors] informed me that there was a delay because [ms yahui] postponed her interview with [e counsellors]. after conducting the interview with [ms yahui], [e counsellors] confirmed the mediation date [in mid]-2023. however, [on the day of mediation], [e counsellors] suddenly notified me that the mediation needed to be postponed due to [ms yahui’s] last-minute request for an extension. finally, [e counsellors] rescheduled ou[r] mediation dated [for mid]-2023, but we did not reach any agreement. [in mid]-2023, [ms yahui] initiated mediation through the family dispute resolution service (fdrs), and i responded, agreeing to participate. however, [on the day of mediation], i received a letter from fdrs stating that the mediation will no longer proceed.
54. [x] (now 8 years old) was interviewed on his own after first a joint introductory meeting with [ms yahui]. at interview, he gladly spoke about his schooling and plans for a future career. he impresses a confident, outgoing and articulate boy. he is a credit to both his parents and this needs to be acknowledged. he also spoke about the gifts he received from [mr ling] and [ms yahui] last christmas. 55. an observation of the father/child relationship was conducted via [a messaging app]. [x] presented as relaxed and comfortable when with [mr ling]. as was the case when observed with [ms yahui], [x] did not appear fearful of contradicting [mr ling]. he was observed to be affectionate and repeatedly entered [mr ling]’s physical space. [x] is spending time with [mr ling]. according to [mr ling], [x] is enjoying spending time with him. [ms yahui] claims instead the boy does not and is at times resistant to going to [mr ling] on a saturday morning. 56. [x] spoke with some animation and enthusiasm about activities he has been sharing with [mr ling] which included visiting parks and trips to [sports games] and beaches. he gave the impression he enjoys the activities [mr ling] provides for him. ... 58. [x] was excited that he was to go to a park with [mr ling] before being returned to [ms yahui]. despite [mr ling]’s[2] belief that the child at time feigns enjoyment regarding activities [mr ling] provides for him, there was certainly an air of genuine delight and anticipation about this prospect. actually, [x] was very impatient for the observation being conducted by this family consultant to end so he could go to the park. 59. [x] was physically close to [mr ling] and showed no sign of fear or apprehension. once again, [ms yahui] thought [x]’s behaviour on this instance (perhaps she asked him about the observation conducted), was artificial and contrived, fearing he would get into trouble from [mr ling] if not manifested. (in this family consultant’s experience, children of this age tend to be transparent and find it difficult to sustain such an act consistently. having said this, it is not unusual for children who have been abused to crave the love, affection and attention from a parent who has abused them. perhaps [x]’s behaviour is an example of this but this is by no means certain.) ... 62. [mr ling]’s relationship with [x] has been restored and, notwithstanding [ms yahui]’s reservations, she has been making the child available to [mr ling] regularly for about six months. ... 82. generally speaking, children need to have a sound and meaningful relationship with both parents for their normative development. this is core to their identity formation. attachment to a trusted care giver on each side of the family offers emotional security. a child needs a strong and secure attachment with both parents to affirm identity with both sides of a family. a secure psychosocial base, derived from strong attachment to each parent, can positively support relationships in the broader community in adult life. having said this, above all children need to be physically and emotionally safe. 83. children of separated parents usually show better outcomes emotionally, socially and academically when they maintain a relationship with both parents but in a low conflict environment. [mr ling] and [ms yahui] need to mindful of this. 84. the parental relationship has been a conflicted one and their conflict and disagreements are about to continue in a legal forum. it is not in [x]’s interest that the two most significant people in his life maintain their conflict. there is ample research indicating that children exposed to prolonged levels of parental conflict are at risk of having their future mental health seriously compromised. [mr ling] and [ms yahui] need to be aware of this. as ongoing conflict between parents can be harmful to a child, ongoing/prolonged litigation is also harmful to parents.
