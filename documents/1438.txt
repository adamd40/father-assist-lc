should a costs order be made against the de facto husband relating to the substantive property adjustment proceedings?
...in exercising its discretion to award or refuse costs, a court should look at the matter primarily from the perspective of the defendant. to do so conforms to fundamental principle. if one thing is clear in the realm of costs, it is that, in criminal as well as civil proceedings, costs are not awarded by way of punishment of the unsuccessful party. they are compensatory in the sense that they are awarded to indemnify the successful party against the expense to which he or she has been put by reason of the legal proceedings.
the financial circumstances of the parties
the conduct of the parties, and the overarching purpose
similarly, when one looks at para (f) it is quite clear that the purpose of that provision is to ensure that offers to settle, if made seriously, are considered seriously, to ensure that the cost of litigation is avoided, the workload of this court is lightened, and one other consideration is certainly that a party with greater wealth is not placed in a position whereby he or she can wear out the other by simple attrition. in the circumstances of this case, although para (f) does not have a priority per se, the considerations represented by para (f) are of overriding importance.   emphasis)
offers in writing
did the de facto husband act unreasonably in rejecting an offer?  in mid-2022 the de facto husband considered that the winding up of d pty ltd would involve paying out a total of about $62,500 consisting of the pay out of: (i) $43,158.88 for the payout of the motor vehicle 1 finance, (ii) $3,297.62 for income tax, and (iii) $16,072.00 for other tax obligations such as payg and gst, (b) in mid-2022, the de facto wife informed the de facto husband that she considered that the winding up of d pty ltd would involve paying out a total not exceeding about $97,300 consisting of the pay out of: (i) $46,336 for the payout of the motor vehicle 1 finance, (ii) $20,437 for all tax liabilities, and (iii) $1,650 for accountancy fees associated with the winding up, (iv) $214 for all asic fees associated with the winding up, (v) $10,418 for all gst, stamp duty and income tax liabilities associated with transferring the motor vehicle 1 from d pty ltd to the de facto wife, and (vi) $18,226 for leave entitlements, and in conclusion, the de facto wife reflected that these figures had been adopted from the estimates provided by the parties’ accountant [mr h] served on your office (the de facto husband’s solicitors) previously. [31]   $43,158.88 for the payout of the motor vehicle 1 finance, (ii) $3,297.62 for income tax, and (iii) $16,072.00 for other tax obligations such as payg and gst,  ) $3,297.62 for income tax, and (iii) $16,072.00 for other tax obligations such as payg and gst,  i) $16,072.00 for other tax obligations such as payg and gst,   in mid-2022, the de facto wife informed the de facto husband that she considered that the winding up of d pty ltd would involve paying out a total not exceeding about $97,300 consisting of the pay out of: (i) $46,336 for the payout of the motor vehicle 1 finance, (ii) $20,437 for all tax liabilities, and (iii) $1,650 for accountancy fees associated with the winding up, (iv) $214 for all asic fees associated with the winding up, (v) $10,418 for all gst, stamp duty and income tax liabilities associated with transferring the motor vehicle 1 from d pty ltd to the de facto wife, and (vi) $18,226 for leave entitlements, and in conclusion, the de facto wife reflected that these figures had been adopted from the estimates provided by the parties’ accountant [mr h] served on your office (the de facto husband’s solicitors) previously.

in conclusion, the de facto wife reflected that these figures had been adopted from the estimates provided by the parties’ accountant [mr h] served on your office (the de facto husband’s solicitors) previously. [31]
what weight should i give to an offer that is marginally less than the outcome at trial?
we do, however, consider that the closer the offer is to the award when the offer is under the amount awarded by the court, the more weight that should be given to this factor in considering the question of costs. this principle must not, however, be rigidly applied. offers must be seen in the context of the case and the extent of the offeree's knowledge of the parties' financial circumstances while the offer is live. in the family law jurisdiction, it is not uncommon to find relationships where one party, often the wife, has significantly less grasp of the parties' financial arrangements, or the financial circumstances are so complex that it would be premature to accept an offer. there are also cases where the contents of the offer are in themselves the subject of disputed value and legitimate subject matter for determination. these and other features of the context of offers must be taken into account when considering whether it was reasonable or not to accept an offer, no matter how close to the ultimate result the offer may be.

conclusion as to justifying circumstances   the de facto husband has the financial capacity to meet such an order and the de facto wife is entitled to some compensation for the costs expended in the intervening period between the making of her offer and the trial, and (b) the de facto husband unreasonably failed to accept the dfw’s consolidated offer in circumstances where he could properly consider the offer, the differential adjustment was just above what the judgment provided for and the consequential accumulation of costs (about the financial dispute) by both parties appears to me to be an anathema to one of the objectives of the overarching purpose.   the de facto husband unreasonably failed to accept the dfw’s consolidated offer in circumstances where he could properly consider the offer, the differential adjustment was just above what the judgment provided for and the consequential accumulation of costs (about the financial dispute) by both parties appears to me to be an anathema to one of the objectives of the overarching purpose.
on what basis should the de facto husband pay the de facto wife’s costs and what is the quantum?  the factors previously identified, (b) my assessment of the apportionment of resources and costs for the trial, (c) my assessment that the sum is fair, reasonable and proportionate to the property adjustment dispute, and (d) the de facto wife’s conduct post-judgment which has required the institution of enforcement proceedings (with an unknown result) and the (perhaps) unintended consequence that the de facto husband has been unable to fully realise the income-earning potential of the suburb c property and thus assist him in meeting any costs order i may make (which has significantly informed the due date for the order to be paid).   my assessment of the apportionment of resources and costs for the trial, (c) my assessment that the sum is fair, reasonable and proportionate to the property adjustment dispute, and (d) the de facto wife’s conduct post-judgment which has required the institution of enforcement proceedings (with an unknown result) and the (perhaps) unintended consequence that the de facto husband has been unable to fully realise the income-earning potential of the suburb c property and thus assist him in meeting any costs order i may make (which has significantly informed the due date for the order to be paid).   my assessment that the sum is fair, reasonable and proportionate to the property adjustment dispute, and (d) the de facto wife’s conduct post-judgment which has required the institution of enforcement proceedings (with an unknown result) and the (perhaps) unintended consequence that the de facto husband has been unable to fully realise the income-earning potential of the suburb c property and thus assist him in meeting any costs order i may make (which has significantly informed the due date for the order to be paid).   the de facto wife’s conduct post-judgment which has required the institution of enforcement proceedings (with an unknown result) and the (perhaps) unintended consequence that the de facto husband has been unable to fully realise the income-earning potential of the suburb c property and thus assist him in meeting any costs order i may make (which has significantly informed the due date for the order to be paid).
following determination of the de facto wife’s costs application, what (if any) costs order should be made?  the de facto wife contended for the making of a costs order against the de facto husband fixed in the sum of $2,093.62,[48] and (b) the de facto husband contended for an unspecified indemnity costs order.[49]   the de facto husband contended for an unspecified indemnity costs order.[49]
