ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge taglieri  the icl submitted that: (i) an order for no time with the father would provide y with time, space and opportunity to engage with therapeutic supports, noting that the children and young persons program (“chypp”) will not engage with her while contact remains between her and the father, (ii) an order for no time with the father would alleviate y from the need to rely on herself when with her father, which she appears to do so as to maintain her own psychological and emotional safety, as well as that of her mother and her sister, (iii) the orders relating to both children would reduce the risk of conflict between the parents as well as between the siblings, (iv) the orders give the father a chance, having heard the evidence of the single expert, to better himself as a carer of his children, (v) the court should be very cautious about the weight it places on the views of y about her desire to spend time with her father because those views are affected by alienating behaviours and therefore not a proper reflection of her being able to consider them in light of all her circumstances. more specifically, counsel said that what is in y’s best interests is inconsistent with her views, and (vi) supervised contact would not be an appropriate solution as y struggles in situations where she is watched or is the centre of attention. (b) counsel for the father submitted that: (i) the orders for no time would allow the father to try and address the significant issues raised in dr b’s evidence, (ii) as noted by counsel for the icl, chypp will not undertake counselling or other supports for y unless and until such time as she is not spending time with the father, (iii) the orders still provided for some limited ongoing relationship between the father and y by allowing him to send her via post to the mother's address a present and card on designated special occasions, and (iv) the orders would act as a circuit-breaker to address the conflict between the children. (c) counsel for the mother adopted the submissions of other counsel and claimed that the father's submissions in particular should carry great weight, given that it is the father who would be most aggrieved by making of the order ceasing time between himself and y. in addition, he submitted: (i) that he was not being glib during cross-examination of the father when he put to him that he had had a “road to damascus” moment, but it was clear that there had been a very major and beneficial shift in his attitudes, which could only be of long term benefit to both y and x, (ii) relying on lainhart & ellinson, he emphasised that the job of the court in the exercise of its powers is to quell the controversy between the parties, (iii) that the controversy between the parties would be quelled by the making of the proposed orders and that the parties did not want to complete the trial or adduce any more evidence, and “to be blunt, the parties want to get out of here”, (iv) that there would be benefit to the children, particularly y, in the parents being able to say that they reached agreement on the orders themselves rather than it being what the court determined, and (v) the parties could not be assured that further proceedings would not be brought but the court cannot speculate on that to the detriment of the agreement the parties have reached.   an order for no time with the father

the siblings, (iv) the orders give the father a chance, having heard the evidence of the single expert, to better himself as a carer of his children, (v) the court should be very cautious about the weight it places on the views of y about her desire to spend time with her father because those views are affected by alienating behaviours and therefore not a proper reflection of her being able to consider them in light of all her circumstances. more specifically, counsel said that what is in y’s best interests is inconsistent with her views, and (vi) supervised contact would not be an
