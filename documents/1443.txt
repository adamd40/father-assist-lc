from: [mr nagle] date: [early] 2023 at 7:13:21 pm aedt to: [ms nagle] subject: re: referral [z] does not have adhd. i have absolutely nil issues with him when he is with me. he acts and behaves like a normal 7 year old boy. he needs to be active and enjoys when i play with him. can you please provide additional information about [z] trying to abscond. if need be he can spend more time with me. in all honesty i think living with women only is severely damaging his growth. why wasn't this discussed with me earlier? from: [mr nagle] date: [early] 2023 at 7:18:36 pm aedt to: [ms nagle] subject: re: referral two children with mental health issues. [y] isn't doing great either. she has gone into her shell massively. not impressed. (original emphasis)
y
issues of concern raised by the parents during the trial
communication and information for the father about the children
communication i attempted to communicate with the [ms nagle] about the rumoured change in living location and details of child [x]’s mental health conditions, [ms nagle] has refused to answer all correspondence... ... communication between the respondent mother and i has been fractured an non effective. i will send commincation via email which frequently does not get responded to. i have attempted to call the respondant with no answer and text messages to do get responded to either. the only communication that is effective is when the respondant wants to change the interium order arrangements tking the children on lavish extended holidays such as [region gg]... the respondant mother refuses to convey information set ou in the court orders regaring the chidlren such as hospital visits, school suspensions, behavioural issues at school and representative sporting events. one could only describe the respondants communication as ‘stonewalling’ a form of abuse.[61] (original emphasis)
the mother’s concern regarding conflict, hostility, and volatility
the tyranny of distance created by the mother’s move to [suburb j]
child support
evidence
it is not inconsistent with the independent and professional discharge of an independent children’s lawyer’s obligations for her or him to advocate that a particular course of action adverse to, or inconsistent with, the position of a party, ought be taken by the court, whilst in a unique position, the independent children’s lawyer owes the same professional obligations to the court as does any licenced legal practitioner, on occasion, the independent children’s lawyer will be in an invidious position, but nonetheless they should be no less courageous, no less firm and no less cogent, in advocating for results or findings, inevitably the role of the independent children’s lawyer involves an exercise of professional judgment which may, on occasion, be precarious and difficult, it is not appropriate for a litigant to endeavour to micro-manage the independent children’s lawyer, or critique every step that they take, it is certainly not the case that, even if an independent children’s lawyer does make a mistake, the court will necessarily accede to an application to have them discharged. significantly more than that is required, it is inevitable that the high standards of competence which the court expects of independent children’s lawyers are not always met. independent children’s lawyers are, like anybody, liable to human frailty, a court should be slow to discharge an independent children's lawyer on the basis of largely unsubstantiated complaints of one of the parties.[85]
standard of proof
140 civil proceedings: standard of proof
in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject‑matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.[86] (original emphasis)
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.[87]
issues for determination
issue 1: should the mother have sole parental responsibility for medical and educational matters?
issue 2: relocation of the mother and children closer to the father’s home
14. in adamson & adamson (2014) flc 93–622, the full court said: these rights, and the right of freedom of mobility of a parent, only defer to the paramount consideration of a child’s best interests where those interests would be so adversely affected as to justify such interference, and then the interference is legitimate only to the extent that it is necessary to avoid such adverse effects. to this must be added the consideration that orders requiring a parent, as opposed to the children, to live in a particular place are rare. in a well-accepted passage, bryant cj and warnick j said in sampson and hartnett (no 10) [2007] famca 1365, (2007) flc 93-350 (“sampson and hartnett”): however, we conclude there is power under s 114(3) of the act to enjoin a parent from relocating or to relocate, provided that that injunction is no more than is necessary to secure the best interests of a child. the proper exercise of such a power is likely to be rare, because: (i) the location of the child will usually be the critical factor, leaving to the parents the choice about their roles, and (ii) in a parenting case, an order directed to a parent to relocate or not will likely only serve a useful purpose if that parent is to then discharge a particular role as a parent. if the evidence supports a finding that the parent will play that role, if the child is relocated or not, the order directed to the parent will likely be superfluous. if the evidence does not support such a finding, the order will be coercive in nature and be equivalent to forcing that parent to discharge a role in circumstances not of that parent’s choosing. ... 21. in relation to the present issue kirby j explained it in ams v aif: secondly, it is important to remember that in australia, whilst the welfare (or best interests) of the child are, by statute, the “paramount” consideration in the exercise of jurisdiction such as was invoked here, they are not the sole consideration. in this respect, the position in this country is different from that in canada. it more closely conforms to the language of the convention on the rights of the child. statutory instructions as to the paramountcy that is to be accorded to the child’s welfare or best interests are to be understood as they apply to a child living in australian society, normally in relationship with both parents and other members of its family. whilst the legislation considered in this case, and later statutory reforms, give the highest priority to the child’s welfare and best interests, that consideration does not expel every other relevant interest from receiving its due weight. in part, this is because (as the english courts recognised long ago) the enjoyment by parents of their freedoms necessarily impinges on the happiness of the child. but, in part, it is also because legislation such as fla 1975 and fca 1975 is enacted to take effect within a society of a particular character whose members enjoy a high measure of personal freedom, diminished only to the extent that the law obliges. (emphasis added)   the location of the child will usually be the critical factor, leaving to the parents the choice about their roles, and (ii) in a parenting case, an order directed to a parent to relocate or not will likely only serve a useful purpose if that parent is to then discharge a particular role as a parent. if the evidence supports a finding that the parent will play that role, if the child is relocated or not, the order directed to the parent will likely be superfluous. if the evidence does not support such a finding, the order will be coercive in nature and be equivalent to forcing that parent to discharge a role in circumstances not of that parent’s choosing.  ) in a parenting case, an order directed to a parent to relocate or not will likely only serve a useful purpose if that parent is to then discharge a particular role as a parent. if the evidence supports a finding that the parent will play that role, if the child is relocated or not, the order directed to the parent will likely be superfluous. if the evidence does not support such a finding, the order will be coercive in nature and be equivalent to forcing that parent to discharge a role in circumstances not of that parent’s choosing.
... [y’s] comments about the new environment and school were equally positive as [x]’s views. ... like the older child, [y] expressed a firm wish to remain at [suburb j]. while she did not enjoy the travel she seemed accustomed to it. her main issue with leaving sydney appeared to be discontinuation of weekend [sports]. ... from his varied discussion, it seemed [z] enjoys life, loves his parents and has no issues in either home.[94]
issue 3: the father’s time with the children – including x
6. that [y] and [z] spend school term time with their father as follows:
6.1. during school term time each alternate weekend from 5pm on friday until 5pm on sunday, that for the purposes of changeovers the mother shall deliver the children to the father at [suburb b] mcdonalds at commencement of his time with the children and the father shall return the children to the mother at [suburb b] mcdonalds at the conclusion of his time.
... notation: the court notes that the parents agree and support [x] spending time with her father from 10.00am until 5.00pm each alternate sunday on the same weekend as [y] and [z] and in the event that that time is to occur with [x] the mother shall deliver [x] to the father at 10.00am at [suburb b] mcdonalds and the father shall return all three children to the mother at 5.00pm at [suburb b] mcdonalds. the court further notes that the parents agree and the independent children’s lawyer does not oppose [x] spending overnight time with her father on the same weekend as her siblings in accordance with [x]’s wishes.[98]
... ms nagle opined that [x] is “rebuilding” the relationship with [mr nagle] and considered it is occurring in small steps. she favoured the child being permitted to make her own decisions regarding spend time arrangements, predicting she will eventually resume alternate weekends.[99]
issue 5: the changeover location
parenting orders: the law
the children’s best interests: the s 60cc factors
section 60cc(2)(a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents
what these definitions convey is that "meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[108]
it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[109]
section 60cc(2)(b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[120]
section 60cc(3)(a): any views expressed by the child, and the weight to be accorded to those views given their age and level of maturity
the terms of s 60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child’s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child’s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child’s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court to these matters.[127]
... [z] started the interview by telling me jokes, at which he laughed loudly. with little understanding as to the reason for his attendance he proceeded to discuss school, friends and interests in a lively fashion, occasionally rising from the chair to demonstrate a particular point. from his varied discussion, it seemed [z] enjoys life, loves his parents and has no issues in either home.[128]
i give her views some weight.
... [x]’s present situation with the father should improve as she gets older and attains greater emotional maturity. turning eleven, she is likely to respond to individual overtures by [mr nagle] (eg: phone calls and messaging), as long as her mother is not criticised. moreover, being the eldest, and an anxious child, [x] appears the one most likely to harbour insecurity over the parental separation and ongoing conflict. once the current dispute is resolved, it is predicted she will feel more personally comfortable, which in turn should flow on to the relationship with [mr nagle].[135]
it changes – her age changed – feelings change – she’s heard a lot of negativity from dad and anger and now she is conflicted – she wants a relationship but wants to be made a priority.[137]
she's worried about mum – she cries herself to sleep ...and she has a closer bond with mum but she worried about mum.[138]
she was upset her being dropped early – she plays [sports] and didn’t want to stay on weekend – we talked about several things and she said couldn’t come because of [sports] – i found it frustrating and i took her home early – i dropped her off early because she crying – i kept the other two – she wanted to go home.[143]
possibly – parenting is learning on the fly – i try my best she likes to push boundaries she can manipulate.[144]
i'd follow her wishes but i want a framework but we work in within a timeframe – and needs communication.[145]
section 60cc(3)(b): the nature of the relationship of the child with each of their parents and others
section 60cc(3)(c): the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child
father: so its about villainising me to psychologist mother: no father: but you wanted to control narrative mother: no i wanted a healthy child father: why not include me? mother: it was in her best interests[147]
from: [mr nagle] date: [early] 2019 at 2:27:13 am aest to: [ms nagle] subject: no more i’m pretty sure you have completely broken me. i’m thinking of giving up on the kids. it might be easier if you just have them and they forget about me. in the long run it will be easier for everyone[148] (original emphasis)
25. i have no issues with [z] at home or within social settings. during a recent telephone conversation between [mr nagle] and the children, i overheard [mr nagle] enabling the chilren to be disrespectful to [z]'s teacher at school by saying she was a 'bitch' and that he would phone the school as 'mum does not stick up for them'. i could see a look of concern on all the children's faces following this conversation. there was then an additional telephone conversation within the next few days between [mr nagle] and the children where i overheard [x] telling [mr nagle] that her teacher had returned to school from an overseas holiday to which [mr nagle] said ' did you say hi bitch to her'? it remains constantly difficult to commincate with [mr nagle] in order for effective and timely decision making in relation to having the children's needs met. i am constantly faced with [mr nagle] intimidating, blaming or criticising me and/or others for situations instead of staying focused on conversations at hand about the children and due to these ongoing long term difficulties, i am seeking orders for sole parental responsibility.[150]
the father conceded under cross-examination that he did call z’s teacher a ‘bitch’ in the presence of the children — something that he now regards as a ‘mistake’.[151]
from: [mr nagle]> date: [mid]-2022 at 7:34:00 pm aest to: [ms nagle]> subject: re: [x] bloody hell. can you keep me updated. and when she can call me [in mid]-2022 at 7:33 pm, [ms nagle]wrote: just letting you know [x injured herself] and [is taking] panadol/nurofen as treatment. she goes back to the clinic in a week but they have indicated it would not be likely that surgery is needed then either. (original emphasis)
section 60cc(3)(ca): the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child
it is my personal view that the respondent has used child support income as the main factor to not allow the children regular visits prior to the interim orders...[155]
section 60cc(3)(d): the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect to the child from any separation from either of their parents
section 60cc(3)(e): the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time and communicating with a parent
section 60cc(3)(f): the capacity of each of the child’s parents to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs

parental responsibility
presumption of equal shared parental responsibility
the presumption — legal principles and operation  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
...   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or (b) family violence.   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or (b) family violence.   family violence.   the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. (emphasis added)
applicability of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in this case – should the mother have the sole responsibility for the major long-term issues of health and education?
the respondent’s behaviours since the court matter have been better but still need a lot of work to co-parent the children into the future.[186]
it is the case that the mother ‘claims’ she cannot communicate with the applicant but also refuses to engage in communication creating a high conflict parental relationship. the respondent uses the children to communicate medical and school issues, contrary to court orders. why should the children be punished for the respondents behaviour towards the applicant with sharing parenting information? the mother made no attempt to communicate that she was moving over two hours away, moving schools, moving sports and seeking treatment for [x]. in the respondent’s evidence she said that she would refuse to communicate if she felt threatened. this included initiating communication. this is the pivotal point of the matter. the respondent controls communication. i do not believe a prescriptive order will assit communication, rather the respondent will use it to determine communication. further supported by fictitious claims when giving evidence, which she sort leave to provide evidence but did not provide the court any evidence. only old out of context conversations mostly about money misrepresented for this matter. thus, making the idea of sole parental responsibility a lever of power granted to the respondent when she has continuously displayed, she will lie and fail to meet the orders.[187]
3.1 inform the father of any of any long term decision regarding the children’s education and medical treatment and invite the father to provide her with any views he has in relation to such decisions for the children within 7 days of receiving a written request from the mother to do so, and 3.2 consider the father’s views and then, 3.3 inform the father of any decision made by her within 7 days of such a decision being made.[188]
equal time or substantial and significant time?  how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[193]   the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[193]   the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[193]   the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[193]   such other matters as the court considers relevant.[193]   for the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend substantial and significant time with a parent only if:   the time the child spends with the parent includes both:  days that fall on weekends and holidays, and (ii) days that do not fall on weekends or holidays, and (b) the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in: (i) the child's daily routine, and (ii) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child, and (c) the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in:  ) occasions and events that are of particular significance to the child, and   the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent.   subsection (3) does not limit the other matters to which a court can have regard in determining whether the time a child spends with a parent would be substantial and significant.
conclusion
is giving the decision to the child in the best interest of the child? or does it make the icl feel good? it is hurting my daughter. evident where the respondent could not even drag her out of the vehicle to stay with me, omitted in cross examination. [x] loves her dad, a framework that supports her instead of making her choose between her mother’s happiness and her father’s. a massive responsibility to put on a little girl. the court should make an order to support [x]. [x] has the right to have a meaningful relationship with her father and a cohesive family unit of children, sharing experiences and values which both parents can provide.[194]
keep in mind that since my report which is now 9 months ago or thereabouts there has been some progress – the orders that the court made more recently and i have heard your [the father’s] account and the mother’s account [about] [x]’s sunday’s with you [the father] and it gives me hope that [x] may in fact be able to make the decision to start spending some overnight time with you [the father] and i would anticipate that if you [the father] continue your patient and very appropriate behaviour with her when she comes to see you [the father] that once she does spend some overnight in fact there might be more periods and she may be able then to join her siblings in spending more regularly with you [the father] on an overnight basis.[195]
having the heard of the success of the most recent orders which were not in place when i did the assessment i would likely change my recommendation today to say yes, [x] should be given the final decision as to the overnight contact – i would be encouraged by her compliance with these orders and i’d see nothing wrong with an order that yes she is to spend the sunday’s with the father – at that frequency as it occurs now as an ongoing basis and with the addition that on each occasion that she be given the opportunity to stay overnight if she selects to do so – and i think that may in fact be helpful to [x] as it gives her most scaffolding regarding relationships with the father and the eventual overnight contact.[196]
the independent children’s lawyer’s costs
that unless deemed exempt by the legal aid commission or otherwise agreed by legal aid, both parties shall pay one half the total cost of the appointment of the independent children’s lawyer being $16,325.17 to the legal aid commission within 6 months of the date of the making of final orders.[197]
a. the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, b. whether any party has legal aid and the terms of any grant of aid, the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answers, questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and g. such other matters as the court considers relevant.
9. section 117(3) provides: to avoid doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children’s lawyer in respect of the proceedings. 10. section 117(4) provides: however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if: a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,
the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children's lawyer.
11. section 117(5) provides: in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2) in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer has been appointed, the court must disregard the fact that the independent children’s lawyer is funded under a legal aid scheme or service established under a commonwealth, state or territory law or approved by the attorney-general. a question arises as to the actual meaning of the legislative intent for the court to “disregard the legal aid funding” of the independent children’s lawyer, because that terminology is susceptible to ambiguity. as opined by austin j in gahen & gahen (no 2) [2013] famca 936, it could conceivably mean either: the independent children's lawyer should be presumed to be unfunded, so as to generally incline the court to order the parties’ contribution to the independent children's lawyer’s costs, or the court should not be swayed by either the presumed ampleness or scarcity of the independent children's lawyer’s legal aid funding when determining whether to order the parties’ contribution to the independent children’s lawyer’s costs. in de roma & de roma [2013] famca 566 watts j explained why the former is the preferred connotation, since the purposes of the legislative provision was to protect the public purse. the threshold presumption as to each party bearing their own costs has no application to the independent children’s lawyer, who is not a party. the law is well settled, however, that there is power under the section, subject to other statutory provisions referred to below, to make orders for or against the independent children’s lawyer and the court may make such order as to costs of the independent children’s lawyer and in such proportions in relation to each of the parties as the court considers just: (de roma & de roma (supra)).[198]
