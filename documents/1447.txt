and it is noted that these orders have been amended pursuant to rule 10.13(1)(g) of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021.
reasons for judgment
judge w j neville
introduction
within 30 days of the date of these orders, the parties are to provide a consent minute that reflects the court’s findings and the procedural course regarding (a) the sale of one of the husband’s properties (and the mechanics of the sale), and (b) the dollar amount payable to the wife from the net proceeds of sale in accordance with the “just and equitable” percentages determined by the court.
within 45 days, the wife’s lawyers are to pay 70% of the husband’s costs, either as agreed or taxed. and it is noted that the father has paid legal costs in the order of approximately $180,000, 70% of that sum is $126,000. if the lawyers agree on that sum so as to avoid a taxation, a more specific order may be made in chambers.
the wife’s first appeal, filed on 11 april 2024, is incompetent and is amenable to summary dismissal pursuant to the power enshrined in the fcfca act (s 46(2)), which power may be exercised by a single judge exercising appellate jurisdiction (s 32(3) and s 32(5)). the solicitors belatedly realised the problems besetting the first appeal and now wish to file an amended notice of appeal substituting themselves as the sole appellants, bringing a challenge to only order 5 made on 14 march 2024. orders are made allowing them a short period of time within which to do so, in default of which the first appeal is entirely dismissed. they are now out of time to file a fresh appeal and would require the grant of leave to do so.
background & context: the “balance sheet” at trial: counsels’ comments
mr howard: ... so those are two [parenting] concessions that my client has made. otherwise, he continues to press for an equal-time arrangement with equal shared parental responsibility. in relation to property, we only had the opportunity for a brief discussion, because the majority of our time was spent talking about the parenting. in relation to the property, it might be helpful to your honour just to go through some of the – what seemed to be just a few balance sheet issues, and workout – we haven’t yet had a conversation about which ones are in and which ones are out, but i can perhaps assist you with most of it, because also in my friends’ hands. i didn’t mean to take the centre stage, but no one else is standing, so ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: could i suggest that maybe rather than go through those now, that perhaps there can be some further discussions ‑ ‑ ‑ mr howard: certainly, that’s ‑ ‑ ‑ ms abdelraheem: yes. his honour: ‑ ‑ ‑ over lunch ‑ ‑ ‑ mr howard: i’m content with that as well. his honour: ‑ ‑ ‑ regarding property. mr howard: i’m content with that as well, but can i just say that there are two proposed add-backs by the wife that, to my surprise, i read about for the first time in a case outline, because there’s no evidence on either side about the proposed add-backs. so that’s an unusual, at the very least, circumstance, and will mean that there will need to be oral evidence about that if it has been pressed...
his honour: i’m just wondering: should – would it be best to have a slightly earlier break now so that any discussions between the mother and her lawyers can take place, and then anything further that needs to be said or questions, or clarifications, that they can occur before the father goes in the witness box. ms abdelraheem: i would appreciate that, your honour. i would – and we’re – there’s also – my learned friend and i have had – started to have discussions about a balance sheet. i haven’t had the opportunity to review a draft that my friend prepared. i just need to have a look at it and obtain instructions. so we may need quite some time. not quite some time as in all day, but as in probably an hour to deal with those issues. mr howard: the differences in the pool, the – as i understand it, are only an $800 difference in the value of a car and a $5000 difference in relation to an – the balance of the wife’s bank accounts and add-backs which are not agreed. so i certainly don’t think we need very long in relation to the balance sheet. his honour: i think what we will ‑ ‑ ‑ ms abdelraheem: well, i haven’t had a chance to look at it. his honour: no. ms abdelraheem: yes. his honour: i know. you’ve told me. what we will do is that we will aim to resume at 11.15. any discussions regarding the balance sheet can be done over the lunch break.
his honour: so, the throng keeps growing on one side in the back, but anyway, are there any advances on the balance sheet, like where are we there? mr howard: i think other than – sorry, my understanding was there’s only two items that are not agreed and they are so close as to be not worth having a debate about. one is a car where we’re $800 apart onto the value and the other is the wife’s bank statements – and i admit i haven’t seen the updated bank statements that might show that the amount that we’ve got, which is about $5000 apart, on the two parties’ balance sheets. so, they’re the only issues that i’m able to identify as being differences in the balance sheet, unless my friend tells me otherwise, and obviously there’s agreement about the family law value of the [super fund 1], but there’s not agreement about it being included in the balance sheet, so that’s a different issue though. so, other than that, i’m not aware of any, unless my friend tells me to the contrary, in which case providing – all i need is some updated statements to show the balances as per – and that will be – as per their numbers and that should be easily resolved. his honour: but there’s still a contest over the add-backs? mr howard: sorry. there’s also a contest about the add-backs, of course, yes. sorry. his honour: right. but, again, they’re not monumental sums. mr howard: no. his honour: ms abdelraheem, what’s the story? ms abdelraheem: my learned friend is correct. there’s only a couple of items that are in dispute. his honour: they were in dispute yesterday, i thought i was going to be told about after lunch and we’re, you know, day 3. ms abdelraheem: it’s really just the wife’s bank accounts, but i’m instructed that we have provided the up-to-date bank statements. mr howard: i will look at them before lunch, your honour. his honour: excellent. okay. so, any other issues on the balance sheet? ms abdelraheem: no, your honour. his honour: right. well, hopefully that that will then be just simply a matter of submissions.
his honour: so we will deal with tenders, responses, hopefully, to my questions earlier today, if there’s anything else about the balance sheet to try to tie things up. mr howard: thank you, your honour. his honour: thank you. adjourned [1.16 pm] resumed [2.34 pm] his honour: mr howard. mr howard: your honour, i have received instructions not to read my client’s mother’s affidavit. and therefore, not call on my client’s mother. my friends have been told that. as a result, from my perspective, the evidence is closed. and we have had a further preliminary discussion in relation to parenting matters. we haven’t discussed the property matters, really, yet. and as a result of those discussions, we haven’t still finalised the balance sheet, but there is only the two things. so i understand – but even with a small amount of time, we should be able to finalise that, as soon as are out of here. we were dealing with other matters during the lunchbreak, as well as having lunch...
wife’s balance sheet (case outline: 30th october 2023) wife: husband: assets $1,816,821 assets: e$1,816,426 liabilities: $382,587 $382, 587 super: $2,000,439 $337,547 total (non-super) $1,434,234 $1,433, 839 (with super) $3,434,673 $1,771,386 husband’s balance sheet (case outline: 31st october 2023) wife: husband: assets: $54,326 + nk assets: e$1,794,526 liabilities: $350,546 + nk e$573,513 super: $211,855 $125,692 total (non-super) $-296,219 + nk e$1,121,013 (with super) $-84,364 + nk e$1,246,705
issue 1: were the accumulated superannuation funds of the parties intended to be in the asset pool?
mr routh: essentially, though, the asset list that your honour was relying upon, and i appreciate this is probably for another location, but the asset pool that your honour was relying upon was about just under $600,000 short from what the actual agreed pool was that was provided to your honour on 10 november ‑ ‑ ‑ his honour: right. mr routh: ‑ ‑ ‑ that my friend was just referring to. his honour: right. mr routh: then assuming we’ve got a correct asset list, it then comes down to whether the percentage applies to the two accumulation superannuation funds, or whether it was your honour’s intention, or whether it was the competing applications, that it would just deal with the non-superannuation pool ...   the first task is to construe the discovery orders made by ball j. court orders are interpreted according to the ordinary rules of construction, without delving into the subjective intention of the judge who made the order: australian consolidated press ltd v morgan [1965] hca 21, (1965) 112 clr 483 at 503 (windeyer j), repatriation commission v nation [1995] fca 1277, (1995) 57 fcr 25 at 33 (per beaumont j, black cj and jenkinson j agreeing). extrinsic materials may be consulted where ambiguity exists on the face of the orders: wende v horwath (nsw) pty ltd [2014] nswca 170, (2014) 86 nswlr 674 at [60] (basten ja). less settled is whether extrinsic materials may be taken into account absent ambiguity: perry herzfeld and thomas prince, interpretation (2nd ed, 2020, lawbook co) at [36.90]. [6] the ordinary rules of construction, in the context of commercial contracts, were recently restated in laundy hotels (quarry) pty ltd v dyco hotels pty ltd [2023] hca 6, (2023) 407 alr 613 at [27]:
“it is well established that the terms of a commercial contract are to be understood objectively, by what a reasonable businessperson would have understood them to mean, rather than by reference to the subjectively stated intentions of the parties to the contract. in a practical sense, this requires that the reasonable businessperson be placed in the position of the parties. it is from that perspective that the court considers the circumstances surrounding the contract and the commercial purpose and objects to be achieved by it.”   as to when extrinsic material may be considered in the contractual context, leeming ja (gleeson and white jja agreeing) explained in cherry v steele-park [2017] nswca 295, (2017) 96 nswlr 548 that the ambiguity of a contract may only be revealed once the surrounding circumstances are considered: at [68]-[86]. that is, ambiguity is a “conclusion, rather than a precondition to the admissibility of evidence of surrounding circumstances”: at [79]. as such, commercial context may be considered from the outset, for example, in laundy at [36]. however, if after considering the contract as a whole and the surrounding circumstances, the court concludes that the language of a contract is unambiguous, then the court must give effect to that language unless to do so would give the contract an “absurd” operation: cherry v steele-park at [73]-[75]. [8] returning to how the issue of ambiguity and reference to extrinsic materials has been considered in the context of construing orders, drummond j (sundberg and finkelstein jj agreeing) observed in yates property corporation pty ltd v boland [1998] fca 1605, (1998) 89 fcr 78 at 78:
“it is impermissible, in my view, as well as being quite unrealistic to attempt to read, that is, to understand, an order in isolation from the context of the reasons for it being made. the full court of the queensland supreme court, in australian energy ltd v lennard oil nl (no 2) [1988] 2 qd r 230 held that, in interpreting an order of a court framed in unambiguous language, regard should still be had to the reasons given by the court for making the order because they form part of a context in which the order was made.”   in athens v randwick city council [2005] nswca 317, (2005) 64 nswlr 58, santow ja explained at [129], [130] and [137] (emphasis in original):
“the purpose of a court order is, ordinarily, to give effect to a judgment. the judgment is not some kind of penumbral context surrounding the order. rather the judgment is the source of the order. a court order derives from its originating judgment ... the order must therefore conform to the judgment, with only such latitude as the judgment allows. ... ... it is the judgment which controls the scope of any consequential orders, setting the parameters for what conformance requires. ... orders when delivered have a continuing life of their own, once the umbilical cord has been thereby severed from the originating judgment. but it does not follow that orders so launched are to be treated thereafter as completely self-contained when it comes to their interpretation. convenience and clarity, especially for the party bound, dictate that the orders should so far as reasonably practicable, be self-standing...”  ] in lim v comcare [2019] fcafc 104, (2019) 165 ald 217, the full federal court considered that regard may be had to the reasons for the court order “whether the orders are ambiguous or not”: at [40] (per mckerracher, markovic and snaden jj). see likewise hamersley iron pty ltd v national competition council [2008] fca 598, (2008) 247 alr 385, john tarrant, “construing undertakings and court orders” (2008) 82 alj 82 at 84-85.
in the light of the court’s rulings regarding add-backs, the property pool should relevantly be taken to be as set out in the husband’s case outline ...
issue 2: were there arithmetic errors in the “balance sheet” used by the court?
issue 3: did the court use the “wrong” balance sheet in its reasons?

issue 4: to re-open or not to admit the november balance sheets?
written submissions on behalf of the applicant wife in circumstances where: orders have been formally entered, there is a right of appeal from the federal circuit and family court of australia (division 2), and an appeal has been made,
the matter should not be reopened, even for a limited purpose. judgment was delivered in this matter on 14 march 2024 and final property orders were perfected on 24 april 2024. it is submitted, therefore, that the matter cannot be reopened for any purpose as the court is functus officio (see burrell v r [2008] hca 34, (2008) 238 clr 218 at [21] and [28] ("burrell") and sangara v hamwood [2007] famca 1353, (2009) 39 fam lr 237 at [42]- [56] ("sangara")). relevantly, in sangara, her honour judge boland: at paragraph [42], outlined the definition of the term "functus officio" as referred to in halsbury's laws of england, 4th ed, vol 29, para 766, at paragraph [56], contended that "i accept that, subject to the availability of r 16, a federal magistrate is “functus officio” when a matter has been regularly determined, and orders are perfected. the federal magistrates court, like the family court and the federal court, is a court created by statute and does not have power to re-open its orders regularly entered (see djl v central authority [2000] hca 17, (2000) 201 clr 226 at 248)" ("djl"). in the later decision of vance & vance [2011] famcafc 17, (2011) flc 93-461 ("vance"), boland j considered the high court's comments in burrell. at paragraph [47] of the judgment, boland j held "...i am satisfied i am functus officio and have been since the making of my orders on 20 december 2011". in light of the high court decision in djl, this court only has such jurisdiction and power as is conferred by statute (also see nh v dpp, jakaj v dpp, zefi v dpp, stakaj v dpp at [67]– [71]). the federal circuit and family court of australia does not have the power to vary or to set aside a final judgment or order once that order has been perfected. the court would seem to have power to re-open to make supplemental orders. however, supplemental orders (such as cost orders and orders aiding the interpretation and enforcement of orders) are ones that are necessary to supplement the final orders made so as to fully resolve the whole of the controversy before the court: see, for example, caboolture park shopping centre pty ltd (in liquidation) v white industries (qld) pty ltd (1993) 45 fcr 224 at 235 and darling downs investments pty ltd v ellwood (1988) 18 fcr 510 at 521 and 525-526. it is submitted that, in this case, there is no longer any controversy before the court requiring a resolution. all outstanding matters were resolved upon the making of the final property orders. in relation to the cases referenced in his honour’s associate’s email: in autodesk inc v dyason (no 2) [1993] hca 6, (1993) 176 clr 300, the high court held that a court has jurisdiction to recall a final judgment but that jurisdiction is to be used with great caution, and the court's decision turned on the important and unusual facts of that case, the case of de l v director-general [1997] hca 14, (1997) 190 clr 207 was a consideration by the high court, being "a final court of appeal" at [20] and, whilst the orders had been pronounced, they had not been entered in the record [24] and accordingly it is submitted does not apply to these circumstances.
written submissions on behalf of the respondent husband these submissions are prepared in response to the request made on 2 may 2024, from the chambers of his honour judge neville seeking written submissions setting out why the matter should not be re-opened for the purpose of admitting into evidence the two balance sheets provided under cover of email on 10 november 2023. at the conclusion the final hearing on 3 november 2023, directions were made for the parties to provide a joint balance sheet. on 10 november 2023, joint correspondence was sent to the court enclosing a joint balance sheet, identifying the areas of contention. following the delivery of judgment on 14 march 2024, the parties were directed to bring in orders giving effect to that judgement. on 22 april 2024, the parties emailed their proposed minute of order to chambers. both of those sets of orders were predicated on the joint balance sheet sent to the court on 10 november 2023. it was clearly contemplated by both parties and the court that the balance sheet would form part of the evidence before the court. those items in contention were subject to determination in his honour's judgment dated 14 march 2024, and reflected in the minutes submitted by the parties. it therefore follows that to the extent necessary to give effect to the intention of the court, the matter should be reopened to formally admit the balance sheet. in autodesk v dyason (no 2) [1993] hca 6, (1993) 176 clr 300. as per mason cj" ... the public interest in the finality of litigation will not preclude the exceptional step of reviewing or rehearing an issue when a court has good reason to consider that, in its earlier judgment, it has proceeded on a misapprehension as to the facts or the law."
... once a matter has been re-opened, the nature and extent of the review must depend on the error or omission which has led to that step being taken. very little will be required in a case where, for example, all that is involved is a mathematical error in the calculation of some particular item of loss or damage. and, in the case of a factual error, the extent of the review will vary depending on whether the error goes to the heart of the matter or whether its significance is confined to some discrete subsidiary issue. ... what must be considered is the question to which the error was relevant and the significance of that question to the decision reached... ... not every case involving error will invite further evidence: it will depend entirely on the issue that is opened up. if the issue is one that invites further evidence, then, prima facie and subject to the ordinary rules of evidence, that evidence should be allowed. we say prima facie because there may be situations in which the particular evidence involved would cause embarrassment or prejudice such that, in the circumstances, it would be unfair to allow it.
brennan j: this court has undoubted jurisdiction to recall a judgment which it has pronounced, at least prior to the formal entry of the judgment, if the judgment has been pronounced against a person who, without fault on the part of that person, has not had an opportunity to be heard as to why that judgment should not be pronounced ((20) state rail authority of n.s.w. v. codelfa construction pty. ltd. (1982) 150 clr 29, wentworth v. woollahra municipal council (1982) 149 clr672, at p 684). the jurisdiction is exercised sparingly for it is important to bring litigation to finality in this court ((21) the approach of courts from which an appeal lies is not so strict, for it may be preferable to recall an unperfected but erroneous judgment rather than allow it to stand until it is quashed on appeal: see, for example, in re harrison's share under a settlement (1955) ch 260, at pp 282-284). nevertheless, natural justice would be denied if, in a case in which the stated conditions are satisfied, the judgment were not vacated. 2. it is desirable to add in the context of the present case a further observation about the opportunity to be heard. a court should not pronounce a judgment against a person on a ground which that person has not had an opportunity to argue ((22) pantorno v. the queen (1989) 166 clr466). however, a sufficient opportunity to argue a ground is given when the ground is logically involved in a proposition that has been raised in the course of argument before the court or is to be considered by the court as an unconceded step in determining the validity of a conclusion for which one of the parties contends ((23) university of wollongong v. metwally (no.2) (1985) 59 aljr 481, at p 483, 60 alr 68, at p 71). of course, the precise ground which a court or judge assigns for a decision will frequently be formulated in terms different from the terms of a submission by counsel but, provided the ground has arisen in one of the ways mentioned, the court or judge may properly proceed to judgment without requiring the case to be relisted for further argument and without inviting supplementary submissions to be made.   the overriding principle is the interests of the administration of justice having regard to all the circumstances of the case, (b) fresh evidence, (c) inadvertent error, (d) mistaken apprehension of the facts, and (e) mistaken apprehension of the law.   fresh evidence, (c) inadvertent error, (d) mistaken apprehension of the facts, and (e) mistaken apprehension of the law.   inadvertent error, (d) mistaken apprehension of the facts, and (e) mistaken apprehension of the law.   mistaken apprehension of the facts, and (e) mistaken apprehension of the law.   mistaken apprehension of the law.
issue 5: what, if anything, flows from the matter being re-opened?   the plurality judgment in smith (at 265) confirmed that “very little will be required [to re-open] in a case where, for example, all that is involved is a mathematical error in the calculation of some particular item of loss ...”. in the present matter, “mathematical error” was plainly involved, (b) in autodesk (no.2), brennan j said (at 322): “the approach of courts from which an appeal lies is not so strict, for it may be preferable to recall an unperfected but erroneous judgment rather than allow it to stand until it is quashed on appeal.” the orders of the court of 14th march required the parties to provide the court with an agreed minute. such orders, properly construed, were procedural and machinery, and not thereby “perfected” precisely because they required more to be done by the parties (and the court) before the court could issue final orders.[24] further, the fact that the matter was re-listed because the parties notified the court that they could not reach agreement as to the orders to be made, necessarily confirmed that there was more to be done by the court to bring finality to the proceeding. accordingly, the factually erroneous and unperfected judgment, as specified by brennan j, has now been re-opened to correct the inadvertent errors identified. further, precisely because the orders were machinery and required the parties and the court to take further action to finalise the matter, contrary to the wife’s submission, the court was not, and could not relevantly be, functus officio. further, and in accordance with the instruction of brennan j set out above, it is a more expeditious course for this court to correct the mathematical error(s) identified rather than allow it to stand until it is quashed on appeal, (c) there is an identified range of areas or grounds where cases are typically re-opened, accepting that this should be done (i) only where the justice of the case dictates and (ii) is done rarely (gaudron j in autodesk (no.2)). relevantly, two of those categories, per promptair and ezra abrahams, are “inadvertent error” and “mistaken apprehension of the facts.” the mathematical errors identified were (and are) clearly “inadvertent errors”, and the use of the husband’s original balance sheet was, equally clearly, both an inadvertent error and a misapprehension of fact in the light of the later balance sheets provided to the court, although not filed, (d) the wife identified a range of mathematical errors, some correctly, some incorrectly. yet, having done so, she refused to undertake the easiest course to remedy them as sanctioned by the high court. she still has available to her, unimpeded by the substitution of the balance sheet, (a) all of her discretionary grounds of appeal, (b) notwithstanding having filed written submissions, the wife’s lawyers still have their procedural costs ground of appeal, as well as (c) their “discretionary” “manifestly excessive costs” ground. added to all this, the wife is in a “win/win or no lose” situation because, whether successful or not in her appeal, she (nor her lawyers), is not at any financial “risk”, assuming her benefactor continues to pay her costs. every litigant should be so fortunate.   in autodesk (no.2), brennan j said (at 322): “the approach of courts from which an appeal lies is not so strict, for it may be preferable to recall an unperfected but erroneous judgment rather than allow it to stand until it is quashed on appeal.” the orders of the court of 14th

[1] his honour also noted that “alignment” of interests was not the only issue, recording, at [6] of his reasons, that the interests of the wife and her lawyers could be in “direct conflict if the issue ultimately devolves to which of them should bear liability for the husband’s costs.” it would appear that his honour was not apprised of the “special costs arrangement” whereby the wife’s costs, certainly at trial, and perhaps likely on appeal, were being paid for by her employer.[2] see janzen & naish [2024] fedcfamc1a 75.
[3] janzen & naish [2024] fedcfamc1a 75[4] t 10-11[5] t 114. the husband was shown a copy of the balance sheet from his case outline (see t 120), which related to him having purchased, and disclosed, a car for his mother, thus not directly relevant to matters here.[6] t 187[7] t 240-241[8] t 9. this same issue was raised multiple times, e.g. t 14, 18 and 19.[9] racing new south wales v racing victoria ltd [2024] nswsc 147.[10] the husband’s references to the reasons is at t 19.[11] this contention was repeated four times: see t 9, 12, 13 & 23.[12] regarding the “slip-rule”, see r.10.13 fcfcoa rules. there are multiple authorities that guide the operation of this rule and its antecedents. see, among other decisions, l. shaddock & associates pty ltd v council of the city of parramatta [1982] hca 59; (1983) 151 clr 590 especially at 597; djl v central authority [2000] hca 17; (2000) 201 clr 226.[13] burrell v the queen [2008] hca 34; (2008) 238 clr 218 at [19] – [21].[14] see generally, smith v nsw bar association [1992] hca 36; (1992) 176 clr 256 at 265 – 267 (brennan, dawson, toohey gaudron jj).[15] there were a couple of errors of citation in the wife’s submissions. they are of no moment, doubtless inadvertent, and need no further comment.[16] smith v nsw bar association [1992] hca 36; (1992) 176 clr 256.[17] autodesk v dyason (no.2) [1993] hca 6; (1993) 176 clr 300. brennan j’s remarks are at 308. gaudron j’s comments, which are broadly similar to those of brennan j, are at 322, where her honour confirmed that a case may be re-opened “if the interests of justice so require”, accepting that such a course would be taken cautiously and usually rarely. accepting also that the high court has plenary power and jurisdiction, and this court does not, as set out presently, the basal principles generally still apply. [18] de l v director-general, nsw department of community services (no.2) [1997] hca 14; (1997) 190 clr 207, and djl v the central authority [2000] hca 17; (2000) 201 clr 226.[19] the summary here is taken from white j’s decision in fdy investments pty ltd v promptair pty ltd [2017] fca 1097 at [30] – [33]. the same basic grounds set out in promptair were almost identical to those set out by the victorian supreme court of appeal in ezra abrahams pty ltd v milburn [2017] vsca 355 at [45] – [47]. the court of appeal’s detailed discussion, which follows its outline of principle, refers to multiple other authorities as well. in the result, the court of appeal held a county court decision to refuse an application to re-open was erroneous on multiple grounds, which included (a) mistaken facts, and (b) the exercise of discretion.[20] the same general facts could also give rise here to “mistaken apprehension of the facts” on the basis that, at the time the reasons were drafted and issued, as matters of fact, the court was only aware of the two balance sheets of the parties set out in their respective case outlines, and conversely, was not aware (a misapprehension of fact) of the later emailed (but never formally filed) “joint” balance sheets, again of each party.[21] dickons v dickons (2014) 50 fam lr 244 especially at [21].[22] although noted in various parts of the principal judgment, the issues of non-disclosure and costs are set out at [216] – [250]. among other things, those reasons note the wife’s counsel’s acknowledgment during the trial of the on-going non-disclosure by the wife and her lawyers. she said that she had no instructions how this occurred.[23] see transcript of 1st november 2023 at 87.[24] as noted earlier in these reasons, the “procedural” nature and reality of the orders has recently been confirmed by austin j in the first procedural hearing regarding the original appeal. see janzen & naish [2024] fedcfamc1a 75. of course, again assuming that the wife continues to be funded by her employer, she has suffered no adverse costs order, but the husband continues to bear the financial burden of her litigious actions.
