other
reasons for judgment
judge glass:
what arrangements would promote the safety (including safety from being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, abuse, neglect, or other harm) of the children and each person who has the care of the children (whether or not a person has parental responsibility for the children)
history of care arrangements
generalised assertions
any history of family violence, abuse or neglect involving the children or a person caring for the children (whether or not the person had parental responsibility for the children)
allegations of physical violence  shams]: ...i remember the incident. the incident was he attacked me and i fell to the ground. king’s counsel for [mr alkaios]: you weren’t pushed to the ground? [ms shams]: he was on top of me. king’s counsel for [mr alkaios]: you weren’t pushed to the ground? [ms shams]: when someone’s on top of you, you kind of fall together. king’s counsel for [mr alkaios]: did he fall to the ground as well? [ms shams]: i can’t remember if he fell to the ground or not. ... [ms shams]: i’m saying that when he was attacking me, he came over the top of me to get to my bag, and then pushed... he did, whether we say pushed, either way, we both went together. ... [ms shams]: i fell to the ground, but it was due to him jumping on top of me. ... [ms shams]: he did not fall to the ground, he attacked me to get to my bag, he came from behind, to get to my bag, and in doing so, he knocked me over to the ground. i don’t recall him going with me to the ground. it all happened very quickly, and i remember getting up, and i just grabbed the card and i threw it.
other allegations of violence and abuse
explanations for the inconsistency between the history of care arrangements and allegations of family violence
king’s counsel for [mr alkaios]: you then say that despite the fact that for four years as at january 2023, you had seen the children suffer greatly, you took no action to change the equal shared parenting arrangement? [ms shams]: i wasn’t able to change it, because i didn’t have support in melbourne. my hands were, in my words, tied, i guess, because if i have to work, i need him to support me, either picking up kids, and i was working two jobs at one stage, if i was working on the weekend which is his weekend to have the kids, well then i have to rely on him because i don’t have anybody else.
any family violence order that applies or has applied to the children or a member of the children’s family
any views expressed by the children
king’s counsel for [mr alkaios]: the boys are both clear though that they’re asking for you to come back and be with them in melbourne, aren’t they? [ms shams]: they have asked me to return, yes. king’s counsel for [mr alkaios]: but they want to stay in melbourne, they just want you to come back too? [ms shams]: i understand they want what’s familiar to them, yes.
i don’t think they were being coerced, and i don’t think they were being deliberately coached, intentionally coached. but they were, in both of the reports, they presented as very exposed to the level of anxiety that there was, particularly, experienced by their father, and the level of tension and conflict, and difference between the parents.
the developmental, psychological, emotional and cultural needs of the children
aware that as the children get older, it’s now some two years since i first met the children, that, as [x] particularly moves towards adolescence, the continuity of a stable environment, that doesn’t have the sort of differences in lifestyle that the mother’s living environment would provide, would be much more capable of ensuring healthy emotional development for both children, but particularly for [x].
i think they would be much more emotionally distressed at a relocation now given that for the last 18 months they’ve been settled in their familiar school and community environment with their father, that historically has been part of their lives. particularly because of the lifestyle differences, and the requirement by the mother, it seems, that the children do adapt almost unquestioningly to her lifestyle, i think that would lead to a great deal of, i think, emotional regression. there was concern about both children’s regressive behaviour and symptoms of distress in terms of incontinence, twitching, and nightmares throughout this process, and particularly during the first report. i think that the children’s potential for their development as they move towards early adolescence is going to be much more compromised should they be required to live in queensland.
the capacity of each person who has or is proposed to have parental responsibility for the children to provide for their developmental, psychological, emotional and cultural needs
mr alkaios’ parenting capacity
ms shams’s parenting capacity
alternative proposals
the benefit to the children of being able to have a relationship with their parents, and other people who are significant to them, where it is safe to do so
anything else that is relevant to the particular circumstances of the children
