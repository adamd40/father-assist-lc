reasons for judgmentrevised from transcript
judge burchardt
1 i am going to give ex tempore reasons for judgment because my conclusion is clear. they may not traverse everything perhaps as fully as they should do. on 30 april 2020, following a four-day trial and a 76-page judgment, given in february 2020, judge harland made orders for x to live with the aunt – as i will also refer to her – and spend time with her father. such time then increasing in december of this year, and from 1 december, x was to live with her father and spend time with the aunt, depending upon how closely they lived together, from friday to monday in one week, and thursday to friday in another week. those orders were tweaked, if i can put it in those terms, in april, i think.
2 but thereafter, the matter has been in and out of the court on several occasions. on one occasion, the father overheld and judge harland had to make orders about that. on another occasion, he failed to provide details of the child’s school and that came back to court. but relevantly, for these purposes, on 17 march of this year, judge anthony kelly made orders for – a contingent recovery order – yes. that was in relation to the school issue. i beg your pardon. and also, having tweaked the orders that were then made, varied the time as to school holidays and, relevantly, ordered the preparation of a family report. his honour was, obviously, sufficiently persuaded that the court would benefit from the receipt of such a report.
3 the judgment of judge harland gave sole parental responsibility to the father and instituted the regime of time, to which i have referred. with the greatest of respect and speaking as somebody whose own judgments are criticised for being hard to follow from time to time, it is not entirely easy to see what it was that was decisive in the outcome of that decision. be that as it may, we now have the family report of dr dd. before i come to that, i want to say something that operates, in a sense, in an overarching way. it is absolutely clear that the arrangements for this child are just not working. each side would blame the other for that and that is a matter that would require determination. but it is absolutely clear that the parties are simply not able properly to conform with the orders as they were made.
4 the very fact that the matter has been back to court twice since then speaks for itself. and whatever criticisms may be made of dr dd’s report, the fact is that it is before the court. all parties agree that the rice & asplund principle, if it may be so described, is about, in the ultimate, the best interests of the child. the question is whether there is a material change of circumstances. in my view, the utter failure of the parties to sensibly cooperate is, of itself, a change in circumstances. it may be said that this was known to harland j, and i think it was, but what her honour was not, perhaps, then aware of was the extent of it.
5 and that brings us to dr dd’s report. it is surprising that, as it seems to me, that she did not feel able to read judge harland’s decision and it was, in my view, ill-advised of the advisors of the aunt and for the aunt to object to her doing so. she ought to have been given that material and other materials. however, the fact is, the court has this report, which does indeed need to be tested, but it gives a very clear and precise and, on the face of it, reasoned set of recommendations as to why it is inappropriate that x lived primarily in the father’s care as the orders of judge harland would otherwise provide.
6 in the face of that report, and accepting that there is room for criticisms of her methodology, the fact is, that it is before the court. it is before the court because the court itself ordered it, and it is my view, would, if it were necessary to have such a finding, justify the view that there has been a material change in circumstances. in my view, the rice & asplund [1978] famca 84 objection cannot be upheld. that then leaves what we do about the matter from here. this matter desperately needs to be heard and determined by judicial decision. i am going to give it a listing as early as is in any way practicable, and i think the thursday and friday before judge dunkley in february are still available.
7 matter will be listed for trial on 1 march 2022, for two days, before judge dunkley. it will be in melbourne because we do not have any courts available that week in dandenong. his honour is a very experienced judicial officer and will no doubt be able to bring a penetrating mind to the very unfortunate and very difficult matters that confront these parties. whatever else one may say about it, it is a tragic set of circumstances and one’s heart goes out to everybody and particularly to x. but for the reasons i have described, it is quite plain that it is in her best interest that this matter be heard and determined by a judicial officer as soon as practicable. and i point out that the posited dates are just over 12 weeks away.
8 that leaves only the question of the spend time regime and in the meantime, i am not prepared to make any alterations to the interim orders that would otherwise have be retained up until december. that regime is to stay in place. then, thereafter, during the summer holidays, her honour had ordered week about. i see no reason why that should be displaced, at this stage, notwithstanding dr dd’s report, because that has not been tested.
9 what i would ask counsel to do is to put their heads together and bring to bear a minute that reflects these conclusions. there are so many orders and interim orders tweaking it all, it may well be better to simply set all extant orders aside and put in the regime i have described, namely, the eight-six arrangement as it presently is, plus this half school holidays, which will be sufficient to get the matter through to trial. i will stand the matter down and request counsel to confer and produce such a minute. if it is the subject of any disagreement, then you can mention the matter again when you are ready. if it is an agreed minute, just send it through to my associate, and i will make the orders in chambers.
10 it is very important to emphasise that the court is no sort of adjudicator, as far as i am concerned, of what might perhaps be described as the relative merits of various forms of belief. all persons in this country are entitled to have whatever form of religious belief they wish, obviously subject to any overarching illegality, but there is not even the remotest suggestion of that in this case. and one has to respect that. one of the big issues in the case, of course, is the asserted – and i think, not really denied – difference of religious views on the part of the aunt and her partner, on the one side, and the father and his family, on the other.
11 the reality is that the pattern of week about is sustained by the orders proposed by the aunt, and given the difficulties the parties have with the operation of orders – and emphasising this is only an interlocutory view of the matter – it seems entirely desirable to me to keep this is straight and simple as possible. true it is that the net effect of that will be that the child will celebrate christmas as it is – perhaps, if i can use such a phrase – ordinarily celebrated by a large percentage of the population, of whatever religious belief. christmas has moved – and the question as to whether or not this is a good thing is open for debate – but it has moved from being a purely religious observation to being a large social observation. indeed, there are those who have complained it has become far too much so.
12 i am not in a position to make any kind of informed assessment of the degree of the father’s concerns. they will be a matter for trial. i emphasise, in saying this, that i am not in any way denying the force and extent of his religious belief and his, no doubt, very sincere concerns as expressed through his counsel. but in all the circumstances, it seems to me that the real benefit in this is keeping the week about arrangement that is otherwise uncontroversial between the parties, and giving them a measure of certainty that is entirely desirable. i propose to leave the change over time as 24 rather than 26 of december, and there will be interim orders in terms of the minutes by consent, save orders (3)(a)(i) and (3)(b)(i). so there will be interim orders in terms of the minutes. and the matter is adjourned to trial on 1 march 2022 for two days before judge dunkley in melbourne.
