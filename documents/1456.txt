my main responsibility was to keep working on the expansion of the property, however there was a continual shortage of funds and there were occasions when work had to cease while we saved for materials. my health was also a source of ongoing concern and there were times when i needed to rest instead of working,[23]
final submissions on behalf of the parties
legal principles  firstly, that the court must identify the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property, liabilities, and financial resources of the parties at the time of the hearing, and (b) secondly, and importantly, that in the application of section 79(2) of the act the court must not make any order adjusting the parties’ legal and equitable interests in property unless the court is satisfied that “in all of the circumstances, it is just and equitable” to do so. (c) if the court determines that it would be just and equitable to make orders adjusting the parties’ interests in property, then section 79(4) of the act requires: (i) the consideration of the contributions made by the parties to the acquisition, conservation and improvement of any property, both of a financial nature but also of non-financial nature, (ii) the effect of any proposed orders on the earning capacity of each of the parties, (iii) those relevant factors set out in section 75(2) of the act, (iv) any other order affecting each of the parties, (v) any child support either party has or is liable to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future for a child of the relationship, and (vi) finally, the court must consider the “justice and equity” of the actual orders to be made.   secondly, and importantly, that in the application of section 79(2) of the act the court must not make any order adjusting the parties’ legal and equitable interests in property unless the court is satisfied that “in all of the circumstances, it is just and equitable” to do so.

step 2 - the contributions of the parties
financial contributions  on page 10 and under the heading “conditions / repairs”, the building is described as being “in poor condition overall... internal paintwork is in poor condition and external paintwork is in fair condition”, and (b) on page 17 and under the heading “general comments”, the property is described as:   on page 17 and under the heading “general comments”, the property is described as:
...currently under renovation and is substantially incomplete which is considered to have a detrimental impact on the market value of the property and as such has been reflected within this assessment. at the date of inspection the property had significant works which have not been completed [list of improvements needed to the house] please refer to attached photos. these issues have been considered within our assessment. our valuation has been completed on the basis that the dwelling would be cleaned and tidied without the completion of any capital works prior to any sale. we note our valuation conclusion considers that a potential purchaser would expect a discount over and above any repair costs for taking on a significantly incomplete project of this nature to account for any unforeseen risks and any inconvenience. ... we note the resident of the dwelling has advised the external cladding to the first floor is non compliant. we have relied upon this information to be true and correct. if this information is found to be incorrect the value and marketability of the property may be aﬀected and the valuation should be returned to the valuer for review or comment
non-financial and homemaker contributions
conclusion as to contributions
we think that in extracting a common principle from these cases and the cases they have relied upon it is important to remember, as was pointed out by ellis, strauss and lindenmayer jj in harris [1991] famca 124, (1991) flc 92-254, (1991) 15 fam lr 26, and by fogarty and finn jj in beneke (1996) flc 92-698, (1996) 20 fam lr 841, the task of the court in proceedings under s 79 is not akin to an accounting exercise. the task is to examine the facts of each case carefully to decide what is appropriate and just and equitable in the circumstances. there cannot be expected to be a universal answer to that question on any given set of facts. it is of the essence of judicial discretion that different minds may comfortably arrive at different conclusions. by and large, marriage is a joint venture where parties can expect to buffer each other from the winds of misfortune that blow during the course of their relationship. the degree of the buffer may depend on how much individual sailing they do without consultation or indeed contrary to the wishes of the other. but there can be no certain answer to how much that should be when applying s 79 principles.
step 3 - relevant section 75(2) factors
step 4 - justice and equity  the wife seeks a 70% adjustment in her favour of both the combined superannuation entitlements together with a ‘carve out off the top’ to her in the sum of $54,000. if the wife’s proposal was successful, this would see the husband receiving a superannuation split of $78,977. i consider that a superannuation split will be of little use to the husband in assisting him to have a roof over his head, (b) in my view the greatest priority in this case is to ensure that, if possible, both of the parties have secure housing given their ages and disparate income potentials. if the sale of town c can be avoided, the sale of which would place the husband in a position of accommodation uncertainty, the court should do what is equitably open to it to achieve this result, (c) the facts of this case compel the court to adopt a one-pool approach so that the wife retains all her superannuation so as to give the husband the greatest opportunity to retain the town c property.[61] such an approach has been adopted in other decisions of this court where an ability to retain a home was considered an important overriding factor.[62] (d) the wife’s oral application to pay up to $30,000 in repairs sale and then divide the net balance 70% in her favour, may further erode the prospect of the husband being able to buy a home in the future if this does not result in a greater sale price, and (e) the sale of the town c property given its poor state may prove problematic given the content and observations of the two licensed valuations before the court and cause further delay. the agents’ fees and sales costs will only serve to erode further an already modest asset pool. the wife’s oral application confirms to my mind that the wife understands the property is in such a poor state that further work is likely to be required before it is placed on the open market.   in my view the greatest priority in this case is to ensure that, if possible, both of the
