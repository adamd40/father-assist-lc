reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
i financially supported the de facto wife after separation occurred. she would say that she needed money to get better, i’d give her what she asked for but she would use it to buy drugs or gamble. i also paid her legal fees in relation to her various criminal charges. in 2016 and on two occasions in 2018, the former matrimonial [home] was completely ransacked and about $[60],000.00 of assets were taken.[3]
i had not sought to finalise the property settlement because based on her behaviour and decisions during the relationship and post-separation, i say that the de facto wife would have wasted the money from the property settlement on illicit drugs and gambling. i also was unsure whether she would engage in these proceedings. the de facto wife and i will suffer hardship if leave is not granted to proceed out of time. i am unable to refinance the current home loan as the de facto wife remains listed on the mortgage and property. further, i am unable to make any significant decisions about the property – the nature of which is a rural property that runs [livestock] for the same reason. the de facto wife is entitled to receive a portion of the asset pool. now that her estate is being managed by the public trustee, i believe what the wife receives from the asset pool will be properly managed. as the asset pool stands, the majority of the assets are held jointly. neither the de facto wife nor i can deal with those assets without the consent of the other. i am seeking leave of this honourable court to proceed with my application out of time in the above circumstances.[4]
applicable legal provisions
...the application is made within the period (the standard application period) of...2 years after the end of the de facto relationship.   the court may grant the party leave to apply after the end of the standard application period if the court is satisfied that: (a) hardship would be caused to the party or a child if leave were not granted, or (b) in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party—the party’s circumstances were, at the end of the standard application period, such that he or she would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.   hardship would be caused to the party or a child if leave were not granted, or (b) in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party—the party’s circumstances were, at the end of the standard application period, such that he or she would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.   in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party—the party’s circumstances were, at the end of the standard application period, such that he or she would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit.   a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if: (a) the persons are not legally married to each other, and (b) the persons are not related by family (see subsection (6)), and   having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.   the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists,   the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them,   the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life,   whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship,   the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[8]
where the court has determined that it is just and equitable to make an order pursuant to section 79(2) or section 90sm(3) and there is clear evidence that one party has engaged in conduct and, but for that conduct, the legal and equitable interests of a party or the parties (or the value of those interests) would have be significantly greater, justice and equity may require recognition of the unfairness inherent in those circumstances in the terms of the orders to be made. how might that be recognised? first, consistent with existing authority, it can be recognised pursuant to section 75(2)(o) (cf section 90sf(3)(r)). secondly, it might be contended that it might be recognised within the assessment of contributions. this court has long eschewed the notion of “negative contributions”. nevertheless, it might be argued that the “non-dissipating party” can be seen to have made a disproportionally greater indirect contribution to the existing legal and equitable interests (for example to their preservation) if it is established that, but for the other party’s unilateral dissipation, those existing legal and equitable interests would have been greater or had a greater value. the assessment of the circumstance under discussion is, ultimately, a matter of discretion. equally, however, authority dictates that it will be “the exception rather than the rule” that a direct dollar adjustment equivalent to the amount of the alleged dissipation of the pool is made to the otherwise entitlement of a party. it may be that aspects of the erstwhile treatment of legal fees pre-stanford will require further consideration in an appropriate case. importantly, of course, as has been emphasised in many authorities including those cited above, not every dissipation by a party can be seen to involve an affront to justice and equity, again the circumstances of the individual relationship must be assessed.

issues relating to time limits
the discretion to extend time must be exercised in the context of the rationales for the existence of limitation periods. for nearly 400 years, the policy of the law has been to fix definite time limits (usually six but often three years) for prosecuting civil claims. the enactment of time limitations has been driven by the general perception that ‘[w]here there is delay the whole quality of justice deteriorates’. [18]
a limitation period should not be seen therefore as an arbitrary cut off point unrelated to the demands of justice or the general welfare of society. it represents the legislature’s judgment that the welfare of society is best served by causes of action being litigated within the limitation period, notwithstanding that the enactment of that period may often result in a good cause of action being defeated. ... a limitation provision is the general rule, an extension provision is the exception to it. the extension provision is a legislative recognition that general conceptions of what justice requires in particular categories of cases may sometimes be overridden by the facts of an individual case.[19]
the discretion ... is to order an extension of the limitation period. it is a discretion to grant, not a discretion to refuse, and on well established principles an applicant must satisfy the court that grounds exist for exercising the discretion in his or her favour. there is an evidentiary onus on the prospective defendant to raise any consideration telling against the exercise of the discretion. but the ultimate onus of satisfying the court that time should be extended remains on the applicant.[20]
the applicant must establish three principal matters: first, a reasonable prima facie case for relief, had she instituted proceedings in time, secondly, that denial of the wife’s claim would cause her hardship, and thirdly, an adequate explanation as to her delay. ... if those three elements are satisfied, the court should further, in determining whether to exercise its discretion to grant relief, consider the question of prejudice which the respondent would suffer by reason of the delay in bringing the application.
... the general principle is that on the issue of the establishment of a prima facie case the court proceeds on the basis that the evidence of the applicant, unless it is inherently unbelievable or contradictory, should be accepted, and the court should therefore decide whether or not on that basis a prima facie case has been made out. if leave is granted, then it is for the court conducting the ultimate hearing to determine whether the prima facie case can be established.[25]
these varying phrases may tend to suggest different shades of meaning whereas in reality they are directed to the same fundamental enquiry which basically is in the context whether on the applicant’s material he or she has a reasonable claim to be heard by the court.  he well-established test is that the applicant must have a prima facie claim worth pursuing or a ‘real’ probability of success. further, leave will not be granted if to do so would not, in the substantive result, alleviate that hardship.[28]
... a consideration, but not a final determination, of the nature of the applicant’s claim. in doing so, the court must weigh the applicant’s case against that of the respondent’s and form a view as to whether there is in fact a prima facie case, or a real probability of success, that would, if leave were granted, alleviate hardship.
...the starting point in determining an application for leave is to consider the question of hardship which requires for its existence a conclusion that an applicant has a prima facie or arguable case of substance having regard to all of the circumstances of the case. that must take into account the costs or likely costs to be incurred in pursuing the claim. ... an analysis of the potential claim of the de facto wife was necessary to determine whether or not hardship would be occasioned to the de facto wife if she were not granted leave to pursue that claim. further, as the authorities to which reference has been made demonstrate, an essential element is to consider the prospective legal costs of pursuing the identified or identifiable claim. obviously, the prospective costs may render the conclusion that no hardship would be occasioned to an applicant to pursue an uncommercial claim.
in appropriate cases the interests of justice might overcome long delay and on occasions an inadequate explanation for the delay, which is only one factor to be considered in determining an application for leave pursuant to s 44(3) of the act.[32]
