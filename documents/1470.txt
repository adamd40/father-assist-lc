in the present circumstances, irrespective of mr kane's relationship with his wife or his other qualities, it would not, in my view, be appropriate to permit him to appear on behalf of mrs kane, having regard to the potential conflict which is apparent on the statement of claim. however, in the present case, there is a further matter for consideration. as the high court has indicated in cases such as yerkey v jones [1939] hca 3, (1939) 63 clr 649 and the national australia bank v garcia [1998] hca 48, (1998) 194 clr 395, it is common that the ties of love and affection between wife and husband may incline a spouse to act in a certain way by reason of the relationship, irrespective of the interests of that party. for this reason, it is particularly incumbent on persons who are dealing, as here, with both a husband and a wife to ensure that they do not regard the husband (typically) as the wife's agent. although these two cases concerned the enforcement by a mortgagee of its rights against wives, who were relevantly volunteers, they are instructive as they illustrate the particular vulnerability associated with spouses and, for historical reasons, wives, in particular. the potential for injustice is, in my view, a fortiori in the case of legal proceedings where, as here, the husband and wife are both defendants and have conflicting interests in the proceedings. for that reason, i would, in any event, refuse leave for mr kane to appear on behalf of mrs kane.[10]
in relation to lawyers acting for relatives there is a comparative dearth of authority. one reason for this, at least in modern times, might be that the potential conflict of interest is so obvious that modern lawyers refer matters involving their relatives to independent solicitors. professor dal pont, however, puts the position as follows: especial care should be taken where a lawyer proposes to act in a transaction for herself or himself and a family member or associate. in addition to potentially compromising a lawyer's independent judgment, such a situation is fraught with potential for conflict of interest. the point is well illustrated by woolley v ritchie where a solicitor acted on his own behalf and for his de facto spouse in real estate transactions. upon inquiring, the de facto spouse was told by the solicitor that it was unnecessary for her to seek independent legal advice. salmon j held that the spouse was not fully informed as to the implications of the transactions, which included the transfer of property and a mortgage in her name to a trust. his honour held that the solicitor was under a duty to ensure that his de facto spouse was fully informed and freely consented, and the solicitor's conflict stemming from his interest in the transactions requiring securing for the spouse independent legal advice. prudent lawyers will not, therefore, act in transactions in which they are personally interested and that involve their spouses, other family members or business partners, unless the other party is separately represented or advised. the need for independent representation or advice in these cases is heightened by the likelihood that the relative or associate places greater trust in the lawyer than a client lacking that association, and that the lawyer may be less scrupulous in matters of full disclosure. the lawyer may be less inclined to advise the relative or associate of the risks of the deal, and the latter may simply assume without inquiring that the lawyer acts in her or his best interests.

...[m]ost cases point to the view that, in this respect, the law treats a firm of solicitors as a single entity, so that if one partner is disqualified, the firm should not act. in principle, given the incidents of the relationship of partnership (involving utmost good faith and loyalty between the partners), and those of solicitor and client (requiring any partner in a firm to do all in his or her power and use all knowledge and information available to them, including to their partners, to assist the cause of the client), it is difficult to see how, where one partner is disqualified, it could be acceptable for another partner in the same firm to continue to act[14].
