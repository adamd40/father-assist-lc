“sub-section (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions, which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs”.
"in exercising its discretion to award or refuse costs, a court should look at the matter primarily from the perspective of the defendant. to do so conforms to fundamental principle. if one thing is clear in the realm of costs, it is that, in criminal as well as civil proceedings, costs are not awarded by way of punishment of the unsuccessful party. they are compensatory in the sense that they are awarded to indemnify the successful party against the expense to which he or she has been put by reason of the legal proceedings".
“indeed, the list of matters set out in sub-s (2a) to which the family court is directed to have regard in making orders under s 117(2) indicates clearly that the subject-matter of the orders to be made under s 117(2) is the costs which a person may be ordered to pay another as indemnity for that other's liability for professional fees and out of pocket expenses reasonably incurred in the litigation, that is, "costs" as that expression is ordinarily understood in the law.”
evidence  the final orders were that the wife pay the husband the sum of $452,358.72 and that the husband was to receive 41.5% of her superannuation (as at the date of final orders that sum was, approximately, $126,454.40). the court notes that these amounts total $578,813.12. (b) on 18 march 2020, the wife, through her counsel, made a final offer of settlement that she pay the husband $600,000.00 within 56 days of the date of the orders, that he receive 30% of her superannuation and that the parties retain all other property standing in their name. as at 18 march 2020, the wife’s superannuation balance was around $328,960.00 and that offer would have given him $98,688.00 in superannuation and $600,000.00, totalling $698,688.00. the court also notes that, at that time, the husband had received, by way of partial property settlement, the sum of $337,389.00. (c) the husband, through his counsel, rejected the offer contained in (b), above and the husband left the court building at lunch time and did not return. the husband made no counter offer. (d) the wife’s offer of settlement made on 18 march 2021 was $119,874.88 above what the court ordered, taking into account both property and superannuation. as ms gordon submitted, the offer of settlement provided a sum of $147,641.28 greater than was ordered by the court, having reliance only upon property and not the superannuation split. (e) the husband’s conduct, throughout the proceedings, should not be ignored. the wife suffered severe domestic violence at the hands of the husband. the husband was abusive, violent and intimidating towards the wife and her legal representatives. on the last day of hearing, the husband was brought to the court from prison and delayed the proceedings by refusing to leave the prison van and to appear in court for the final day of the hearing, notwithstanding his counsel attending upon him to seek his attendance. the husband’s evidence made a number of unsubstantiated allegations and he had failed to provide disclosure and information. (f) on 18 may 2021, she wrote to the husband’s solicitor seeking a costs order on an indemnity basis for her costs incurred from 18 march 2020 to the end of the hearing. the court notes from the wife’s solicitor’s cost disclosure letter that the wife’s actual costs were in the order of some $93,633.41 (as rendered and incurred but not yet rendered as at 10 march 2020). she advised the husband’s solicitor that the wife was then seeking costs of $86,382.58, made up of $38,257.58 in solicitor’s fees, $45,100.00 in counsel’s fees and $3,025.00 in disbursements and made an offer of compromise to settle the costs dispute for $50,000.00. (g) she set out the wife’s costs, as particularised at paragraph 83, below. (h) she did not provide a cost figure for the wife’s application for indemnity costs in terms of her making her costs application, itself.   on 18 march 2020, the wife, through her counsel, made a final offer of settlement that she pay the husband $600,000.00 within 56 days of the date of the orders, that he receive 30% of her superannuation and that the parties retain all other property standing in their name. as at 18 march 2020, the wife’s superannuation balance was around $328,960.00 and that offer would have given him $98,688.00 in superannuation and $600,000.00, totalling $698,688.00. the court also notes that, at that time, the husband had received, by way of partial property settlement, the sum of $337,389.00.

“if one considers the issue as a matter of policy, that is, on the basis of what the parliament's objective and purpose was in enacting the legislation, it is clear that the parliament wished to encourage settlements thereby reducing the cost of litigation to the parties and to the community. that must mean that a party cannot reject or ignore a reasonable offer seriously made except at his or her peril as to costs. at the same time a party cannot sit tight and postpone a decision as to acceptance until a matter is at the door of the court. by that time an offer which might have been acceptable to the offeror because of savings in time and preparation costs, may have become unattractive. in this case the offer was left open for a reasonable period, was clear and capable of acceptance which would have saved the parties considerable costs....”
““...whilst s 117(2a) does not provide any direct guidance to where weight should be given in any one particular case, it is very important for the court to give proper consideration to written offers of settlement that have been made. ...the failure to heed a reasonable offer in circumstances where there is adequate knowledge of the parties at the time the offer is made to give it a proper consideration, is something to which very significant weight indeed ought normally be given.”   the wife’s offers prior to 18 march 2020 were not expressed with sufficient clarity or precision to enable them to be reasonably capable of acceptance so as to satisfy a justifying circumstance in terms of consideration under this factor. the court notes that the wife submitted that her “indemnity” costs from 1 june 2018 (being the date of her first offer, as referred to in paragraph 61(a), above) was in the sum of $215,724.48. the wife has provided no breakdown as to how these costs were, specifically, made up. (b) however, by at least 18 march 2020, the husband had adequate knowledge, at the time of the wife’s offer of that date, as communicated by her counsel, particularly as to the quantum of the property pool and superannuation available for division between the parties, so as to give proper consideration to the terms of her offer. (c) the terms of the wife’s offer of 18 march 2020 were not ambiguous or unclear and appeared to be expressed with sufficient precision and were, objectively, capable of being clearly understood. see in the marriage of harris [1987] famca 7, (1987) flc 91-822. (d) the husband, at the time of the wife’s offer, had available to him legal advice to determine its reasonableness. (e) while the court’s orders represent the outcome of an exercise of discretion in respect of the facts ultimately found at hearing, the wife’s offer of 18 march 2020 would have seen the husband receive a greater sum than was ordered by the court and should have been accepted by him. the court does not accept the husband’s submission that the parties’ positions vis-à-vis ms jordain prevented him from giving appropriate consideration to the wife’s offer. (f) the wife’s offer dated 18 march 2020, as referred to above, is a justifying circumstances weighing in favour of a costs order. the husband submitted that the non-acceptance of a relevant offer of settlement in writing could not be so exceptional as to warrant an indemnity costs order. the court accepts the husband’s submission in the circumstances of this matter, in that regard.   however, by at least 18 march 2020, the husband had adequate knowledge, at the time of the wife’s offer of that date, as communicated by her counsel, particularly as to the quantum of the property pool and superannuation available for division between the parties, so as to give proper consideration to the terms of her offer.

“the power to order costs on an indemnity basis... ...that in an appropriate case, the court has a discretion to order costs on an indemnity basis and that such costs may be ordered where they have been incurred under a costs agreement which departs from the usual scale of costs. however, it is fundamental to the exercise of that discretion in the family court that the judge should not only understand that such an order is a very great departure from the normal standard, but also that the judge should know what the terms of the agreement are, to what extent it exceeds the parameters set by the scale and what its likely impact will be on the financial position of each of the parties. this impact is a relevant matter to which the trial judge should have had regard, when considering the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings under sec 117(2a)(a), or perhaps even more as a relevant matter under paragraph (g). the degree to which a costs agreement departs from the established norm and the actual financial significance of such a departure may itself be a reason for not ordering costs on an indemnity basis. the proper exercise of the discretion the intent of sec 117(1) and 117(2) is that in this jurisdiction costs should not follow the event as a matter of course. however, where the justice of the matter so requires, the court may make such order as the court considers just. as we have pointed out, the court may depart from the scale of costs prescribed under the rules... the court should not depart lightly from the ordinary rules relating to costs between party and party and the circumstances justifying the departure should be of an exceptional kind... indemnity costs orders are still an exception in this and other jurisdictions... insofar as an unaccepted offer of compromise which exceeds a judgment may justify an order for costs, the general practice in this jurisdiction so far has been to order no more than costs on a party and party basis. even in cases where there has been dishonest concealment of assets or income... no more than party and party costs have been awarded. when considering what is just in this case, one must bear in mind that a party who enters into a costs agreement should be warned and must anticipate in this jurisdiction that each party might well have to bear his or her own costs, and that even if an order for party and party costs is made, the difference between party and party costs and costs payable under a costs agreement may consume all, or a substantial part, of the property order. in this particular case the wife changed her solicitors in august 1990. it must then have been apparent to her, or at least to her new solicitors that this might become drawn out litigation and that a rate of costs which amounted to three times the scale, exposed the wife to great risks. if she was willing to assume these risks, it does not seem just to saddle the husband with them.

“it is, however, a mistake to think that if a costs order is made, that order can only be on a party and party basis or on an indemnity basis. the words “such order as to costs ... as the court considers just” permit the court to fashion an order that is apt to the circumstances. one such well-known example is assessment on a trustee basis, which is more generous than party and party costs, but falls short of an indemnity. orders for a partial indemnity or for a particular period are obvious possibilities. the court may also fix costs in a particular sum, taking account of all relevant circumstances, that type of order too is neither one for party and party costs nor an indemnity costs order. for convenience, in these reasons we shall refer to such orders as a “special costs order””.
“we accept the practicality of the submission that, in an appropriate case, a judicial officer should make an order in sum certain, rather than put the parties to the expense and stress of further proceedings to assess costs.”   applying the same percentage as referred to in paragraph 84, above, to her solicitor’s costs, she would be entitled to recover $31,863.33.
