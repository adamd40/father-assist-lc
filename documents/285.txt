if you want to leave me, i can only use my death to answer you. it is impossible for us to take divorce as an end once we married. you should be absolutely clearly aware of that. it is no use to say anything from now on, our relationship has been destined, only death can separate us.
using the child to pursue the relationship
nature of relationship between child and father
impact of the father’s behaviours on the mother
deliberation
... in russell v close, the full court referred to the decision of the full court in b and b [1993] famca 143, (1993) flc 92-357 (“b and b”) and stated, at [32]:
in upholding children’s right to protection from sexual, psychological and/or emotional harm, the court must take into account any anxiety on the part of the primary caregiver concerning the child’s exposure to potential harm where such anxiety is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s caregiving ability.
79. in the cited decision of b and b, the full court, at 79,780 stated:
it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children’s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children’s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s ability to care for the children.
... ... what the full court did in blinko was draw upon the line of authority commencing with russell v close and, at [83], usefully summarise the relevant principles adumbrated in those authorities as follows:  ] it may be taken as well established by a line of authorities generally acknowledged to commence with russell & close ... that the following are correct statements of principle: if a court is satisfied that a parent represents an unacceptable risk of harm to a child, then unless that risk is able to be sufficiently managed or ameliorated by, for instance, supervision of any time or communication between the parent and the child, the best interests of the child may require an order prohibiting that parent from spending time or communicating with the child, if the court does not find that a parent represents such an unacceptable risk of harm, nonetheless it may take into account anxiety on the part of the other parent arising from their genuine, but not necessarily rational, belief that the parent represents such a risk of harm. in such a case, the other parent’s belief must be genuinely held. if it is entirely irrational and baseless, then the genuineness of the belief would clearly be open to doubt. however where such a belief is genuinely held, if the child spending time with a parent would sufficiently erode the other parent’s capacity to properly care for the child, then that may of itself mean that the ensuing detriment to the child determines that it is in their best interests not to spend time or communicate with the parent, further, where the history of abuse, violence or like behaviour between two parents means that any continued interaction between them would similarly erode the resident parent’s capacity to care for the child, the need for peace and tranquillity in their household may be a more compelling need for the child and hence also might justify an order prohibiting the other parent from spending time or communicating with a child: see sedgley & sedgley [1995] famca 154, (1995) flc 92-623.   the father stalked the mother and unlawfully entered her premises and such amounts to intimidation and family violence (paragraph 68
