background
... with respect to positive impression management, ms badri’s pattern of responses suggests that she tends to portray herself as being exceptionally free of common shortcomings to which most individuals will admit. as a result, she will be quite reluctant to admit to minor faults, perhaps not even willing to admit these faults to herself. she may be blindly uncritical of her own behaviour and insensitive to negative consequences associated with her behaviour, tending to minimize the negative impact that her behaviour has on others and on herself. given the high level of defensiveness, the clinical scale profile potentially reflects considerable distortion and minimization of difficulties in several areas. regardless of the cause, the test results are unlikely to be a valid reflection of ms badri’s experience. the following interpretation is provided only as an indication of ms badri, self-description. ms badri’s self-report regarding her personality and mental health functioning can not be considered at face value. with the aforementioned response style in mind, the pai clinical profile reveals no elevations that should be considered to indicate the presence of clinical psychopathology. the pai clinical profile is entirely within normal limits. there are no indications of significant psychopathology in the areas that are tapped by the individual clinical scales. ms badri, however, indicates a certain amount of turmoil in important life areas. despite the level of defensiveness noted above, there are some areas where she described problems of greater intensity than is typical of defensive respondents. these areas include: suspiciousness, stress in the environment, poor sense of identity, and distrust. ... ms badri’s pds profile indicates high im and sde subscales. individuals scoring high on both subscales tend to be restrained and generally well-socialized but, when they do have problems, they lack the insight to deal with them and appear rigid. they may also appear sanctimonious about others' problems. in sum, they have a trait-like style towards self-enhancement as well as a tendency to be influenced by situational demands leading them to respond in a socially acceptable manner. situational demands may have had the most important effect on the responses. overall, ms badri’s profile reflects overly positive self-presentation. there is a very high likelihood of invalid responses. ... interactions between the mother and the children overall were polite and satisfactory, though limitations to their relationships were observed. there was a lack of attachment between the mother and the children. the evaluation raised concerns about the extent to which there are sound and solid relationships between the children and their mother. ... [child 2] reported that she is in year 11. she reported attending a public school, and liking her current school more than her previous private school. she reported that her public school was more inclusive and accepting of students of all abilities and interests. she denied comprehension, social or behavioural problems at school. she reported liking to chat with her friends online and at school. she denied any extracurricular activities.
... [child 2] reported that she would like to re-engage her mother in the future, but needed time to reflect on recent events. she also reported that she wished to remain living with her father and visit with her mother, given her mother’s difficulties with anger and aggression. [child 2] stated that she felt her mother may also may need psychological help. she reported that her mother had attempted suicide previously. she reported that she heard her mother “gagging” after taking pills ... [child 3] reported that he was living with his father because his mother had hit him. he reported that he was scared of his mother when she was angry. [child 3] disclosed that his mother has hit him previously when she was angry. [child 3] reported that his parents had separated following an argument over his sisters sleeping over at their aunt’s home. he reported that he wasn’t home at the time of the argument and that his sisters had informed him of what happened. [child 3] reported that his mother and father hadn’t been talking to each other much in the period prior to the incident. ... [child 4] is aged 9 years. he was interviewed on 14 may, 2021 over approximately 45 minutes.
... [child 4] described typical age-based concerns and interests. he did not present as overly informed about the assessment. [child 4] reported that he was told he was coming to speak to a psychologist. he couldn’t describe what a psychologist was, other than to say “someone you talk to”. there was no evidence of coaching in this context. a summary of the evaluation follows.
... [child 4] said that he wants to rotate between his respective parents’ homes each day. [child 4’s] report was unsophisticated in the context of his age and level of development, but seemed to indicate that he wished to spend equal time with each parent. [child 4’s] overall disclosures did not indicate abuse or neglect. [child 4] appears to be comfortable in the care of either parent. ... with respect to positive impression management, [the father’s] pattern of responses suggests that he tends to portray himself as being relatively free of common shortcomings to which most individuals will admit, and he appears somewhat reluctant to recognize minor faults in himself. given this apparent tendency to repress undesirable characteristics, the interpretive hypotheses in this report should be reviewed with caution. although there is no evidence to suggest an effort to intentionally distort the profile, the results may underrepresent the extent and degree of any significant findings in certain areas due to [the father’s] tendency to avoid negative or unpleasant aspects of himself. the pai clinical profile is entirely within normal limits. there are no indications of significant psychopathology in the areas that are tapped by the individual clinical scales. despite the level of defensiveness noted above, there are some areas where [the father] described problems of greater intensity than is typical of defensive respondents. these includes stress in the environment. ... [the father’s] pds profile indicates a markedly elevated im subscale and a low sde subscale. this profile is usually found in individuals who are aware of their shortcomings, but want to appear publicly acceptable. in this case, the im scale score is elevated. test results are likely to be overly positive and probably not valid. implicit or explicit demands of the situation may have promoted socially desirable responding.
... parental risk the mother was assessed with a greater level of parental risk (moderate-high) primarily given allegations that she has been physically abusive. [the mother] presents as emotionally reactive and impulsive. interpersonally she is described a critical, and fluctuating between being volatile or withdrawn. both parents, however, have been unable to establish co-parenting, in a fashion that has not been helpful to the children. the father was assessed as low risk, primarily given a level of relationship stability and coopetition with the children. the parents lack functional communication. as stated, the mother is alleged to have perpetrated physical and verbal abuse against the children. she possibly has limited frustration tolerance. it appears that she also endorses physical discipline at some level. the elder children have also described their mother as demonstrating a lower level of meaningful engagement and support than their father. the elder children were observed to be quite disengaged from the mother during interactions. the mother’s psychological testing has validity problems, namely significant positive impression management. this presents as consistent with difficulties reconciling her problematic family relationships. [the father] has not had to face the upheaval of relocating and adjusting to a new country later in life. he spent a large portion of his childhood and adolescence in australia and is readily available subsequently to meet the needs of an adolescent and emerging adolescent children, who likewise have grown up in australia. [the father’s] relationship with the children subsequently has been able to evolve without added pressures. it is plausible, however, that he has not remained attuned to the potentially evolving emotions, needs and attitudes of [the mother], who views his demeanour as controlling and undermining of her. the father was unable to identify the mother as offering any parental benefits currently. he appeared somewhat content with his positive relationship with the children (which indeed was observed during interaction). he did not identify any areas of growth personally. the father presented as rigid in his opinions that the mother is problematic. his approach to parenting the children subsequently, is likely to be somewhat one sided, even if inadvertent. [the father’s] pai outcomes indicated impacts associated with stress in his environment. similar to [the mother], [the father’s] clinical profile indicated positive impression management, though not at a level that would necessarily invalidate outcomes. this is not an uncommon response pattern where child custody matters are being evaluated.   on 11 november 2021, i say as follows: (i) during [the mother’s] time with [child 4] and [child 3], [the mother] took them to [suburb 1] police station in [suburb 2] to speak to the [suburb 1] sex offence and child abuse investigation unit at around 4pm.
