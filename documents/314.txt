4. the notice of appeal, filed by the father on 2 december 2021, pleads these grounds of appeal: 1. the orders were not made on consent, i never agreed that the court has the power to make this ruling and override a hca ruling that has been in place since 1949. 3. i refer to section 51 (xxiiia) of the australian constitution 1901. in this section the government is given powers to authorise health services, but not as to form any part of civil conscription. 4. british medical v commonwealth hca 1949 - the judges in this case found that not only did civil conscription refer to doctors and dentists but also to patients. 5. this is a constitutional question and needs to be heard in the high court of australia. (as per the original) (bold emphasis added) [...] 6. given the apparent lack of any reasonable prospects of its success, the appeal was listed today to enable the father to be heard about why the appeal should not be summarily dismissed.[56]

the proposls of the parties at the review application hearing
the father’s proposal
68 the father’s proposal was difficult to ascertain as it has changed throughout this proceeding. as discussed previously, the father did not comply with the 22 july 2020 orders which required the father to file and serve an initiating application and a notice of risk within 20 days, as the proceedings had been commenced irregularly with the father’s 27 may 2020 application in a case.[80] the father’s 27 may 2020 application in a case sought an order that the father become the primary carer of the child.[81]
69 further the father did not comply with the 8 november 2021 orders which required that prior to the interim defended hearing, an application should be made on notice in writing as an application in a case with supporting affidavits.[82] instead the father continued to rely upon the father’s 26 october 2021 affidavit, where he sought a variation of the 30 october 2019 orders that there be a shared care arrangement with the mother.[83]
70 it was not until the father served the father’s proposed minute of orders on 23 february 2022 that it became apparent that the father was seeking to reinstate the 30 october 2019 orders, notwithstanding that he remained located in city o, country n (father’s proposal).

the icl’s proposal
74 the icl supported the mother’s proposal (icl’s proposal).[86]
relevant legal principles
rice and asplund considerations
75 the 30 october 2019 orders were final consent orders. final orders cannot easily be changed because of the rule in rice and asplund[87] (rice and asplund), which is designed to prevent parties from returning to court to seek new court orders unless there has been a substantial change in circumstances. this was explained in edwards and edwards[88] where the full court of the family court stated: the well settled principles in rice and asplund (supra) were formulated to promote the best interests of children who are the subject of proceedings under the act. the principles recognise the damage which may be caused to children by endless litigation which may, directly or indirectly, expose them to conflict, and the potential of abuse of the child by subjecting the child to repeat expert interviews.[89]
76 the full court of the family court in elimi & munro[90] (elimi & munro) considered the principles in rice and asplund. in that case the full court said there was no scope for doubting the correctness of rice and asplund. the full court noted that in poisat and poisat[91] the full court said (at [13]) that the principal was: [...] intended to apply universally in the sense of applying to every case in which final parenting orders are sought to be discharged or varied subsequently.[92]
77 the full court in elimi & munro held that: the essence of the issues to be determined is whether there has been a material change in circumstances which indicate that it would be in the best interests of the child for there to be a reconsideration of the parenting orders.[93]
78 in this case neither the father nor counsel for the mother or the icl made an application for a threshold determination as to whether there had been a material change in circumstances, for the purposes of the rule in rice and asplund. nevertheless, for the reasons that follow and taking into account the relevant provisions of the act, i have considered the principles enunciated in rice and asplund and i am satisfied that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances subsequent to the making of the 30 october 2019 orders such that it is in the best interests of the child to warrant a reconsideration of the 30 october 2019 orders.
applications for review
79 powers delegated to senior judicial registrars for division 2 of the federal circuit and family court are set out in s.254 of the federal circuit and family court of australia act 2021 (cth) and in schedule 4, clause 2 of the federal circuit and family court (family law) rules 2021 (cth) (rules).
80 the application for review was lodged with the court within 21 days of the date of the relevant decision being the 10 december 2021 orders, in accordance with r.14.05(2) of the rules.
81 applications of this kind are heard de novo in accordance with r.14.07(1) of the rules. rule 14.07(2) stipulates the evidence that the court may receive as follows:
14.07 procedure for review [...] (2) the court may receive as evidence: (a) any affidavit or exhibit tendered in the first hearing, or (b) any further affidavit or exhibit, or (c) the transcript (if any) of the first hearing, or (d) if a transcript is not available—an affidavit about the evidence that was adduced at the first hearing, sworn by a person who was present at the first hearing.
disability discrimination act 1992 (cth)
82 the father claims that he has a disability as defined within the disability discrimination act. section 4 of the disability discrimination act defines a ‘disability’ as follows:
disability, in relation to a person, means: (a) total or partial loss of the person’s bodily or mental functions, or (b) total or partial loss of a part of the body, or (c) the presence in the body of organisms causing disease or illness, or (d) the presence in the body of organisms capable of causing disease or illness, or   the malfunction, malformation or disfigurement of a part of the person’s body, or (f) a disorder or malfunction that results in the person learning differently from a person without the disorder or malfunction, or (g) a disorder, illness or disease that affects a person’s thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour,   a disorder or malfunction that results in the person learning differently from a person without the disorder or malfunction, or (g) a disorder, illness or disease that affects a person’s thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour,   a disorder, illness or disease that affects a person’s thought processes, perception of reality, emotions or judgment or that results in disturbed behaviour,
and includes a disability that: (h) presently exists, or (i) previously existed but no longer exists, or   may exist in the future (including because of a genetic predisposition to that disability), or   is imputed to a person.
family law act 1975 (cth)
83 i will turn now to the relevant legal principles governing my decision in this matter, which are set out in pt.vii of the act.
84 pursuant to s.60ca of the act, the court, in determining this application for review, must consider what is in the child’s best interests. what this means is individual cases is determined by a number of statutory provisions. in determining what is in the child’s best interests, the court must consider the matters set out in s.60cc of the act.
85 section 60cc of the act sets out the primary and additional considerations that the court is to take into account in determining what is in the best interests of children. each of those matters, where relevant, must be considered and assessed in the context of the respective proposals. the court must then determine which of the proposals is in the child’s best interests.
86 the primary considerations are set out in s.60cc(2) of the act and the additional consideration in s.60cc(3) of the act.
87 pursuant to s.60cc(2a) of the act, the court in applying the primary considerations in s.60cc(2) of the act, is to give greater weight to the considerations set out in s.60cc(2)(b) of the act.
88 the full court in goode & goode [2006] famca 1346 mandated that the legislative pathway must be followed in all parenting cases and set out the procedural steps to be followed in interim proceedings.[94]
89 in keats & keats [2016] famcafc 156 the full court held in respect of interim proceedings: .] that apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge may have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected.[95]
90 an interim hearing is therefore, by its very nature, a curtailed hearing. evidence is limited and the matter is decided on the papers.
consideration
91 i will now consider the primary considerations in s.60cc(2) of the act.
section 60cc(2)(a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents,
92 in the section 11f report the family consultant reported that: 24. overall, [the child] was observed to have a similar and relaxed bond with both parents and no concerns were noted during either parent’s interactions with [the child].[96]
93 the section 11f report was prepared on 15 july 2020, over 18 months ago when the child was aged 3 years. the child is now aged 5 years. the mother has been the primary carer of the child since separation. the mother contends that the child should maintain a meaningful relationship with both parents, however this relationship needs to be protected in the context of the conflict between the parents.[97] the mother has stated that the child is confused about the circumstances of the father leaving australia and has been unsettled by the change in her routine.[98]
94 i determine that the child has a meaningful relationship with the mother within the context of s.60cc(2)(a) of the act. i also determine that the child has had a meaningful relationship with the father within the context of s.60cc(2)(a) of the act, however the current status of that relationship is not independently verified by reason of the lapse in time since the section 11f report and the change in circumstances with the father leaving australia to reside in city o, country n.
section 60cc(2)(b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
95 the father left australia to reside in city o, country n without providing any prior notification to the mother, the icl or the court.
96 when the mother asked the father directly in an email on 7 december 2021 whether he was in country n, the father failed to respond to this specific request. it was only during the interim defended hearing on 10 december 2021 that the father revealed to the mother, the icl and to the court that he was in city o, country n.
97 after the interim defended hearing the father persisted with his view that the paternal grandmother was entitled to spend time with the child whilst he is in country n, and the father filed the application for review. the father has maintained this viewpoint despite being warned by notation d of the 10 december 2021 orders that members of the paternal family are not parties to the proceeding and are not bound by orders of the court. the father insisted on proceeding with the review application hearing, notwithstanding that he remained in country n.[99]
98 there are two affidavits from the paternal grandmother filed in this proceeding.[100] these affidavits do not detail the paternal grandmother’s capacity to care for the child. the evidence in these two affidavits falls a long way short of any substantive evidence in support of the paternal grandmother spending substantial and significant time with the child. the paternal grandmother is not and has never been the child’s carer. in the absence of evidence from the paternal grandmother as to her capacity to care for the child, there is no evidence before the court that it is appropriate for the paternal grandmother to step in and fulfil the father’s role as caregiver pursuant to the 30 october 2019 orders.
99 further, there has never been any agreement between the mother and the father that the paternal grandmother care for the child for an extended period of time, in the absence of the father. the mother opposes the paternal grandmother being the child’s carer whilst the father is in country n for the reasons enumerated in [18] of the mother’s 9 december 2021 affidavit.
100 after the interim defended hearing the father sent two emails to the mother (copied to the icl) on 22 december 2021, demanding that the child be returned to the care of the paternal grandmother.[101] these emails are demeaning and abusive towards the mother and are completely misconceived from a legal perspective.
101 on 22 december 2021 the icl sent an email to the father explaining the correct legal position as a consequence of the 10 december 2021 orders and the filing of the father’s 22 december 2021 application in a proceeding. in this email the icl requested that the father change the “tone and content” of his correspondence. in response on 22 december 2021 the father replied with an email to the icl (copied to the mother) refusing to moderate the tone and content of his emails. this email from the father directed a high degree of abuse towards the icl and the mother. the father also threatened to take the icl and counsel for the icl “to court after the constitutional argument is settled in my favour”.[102]
102 on 26 january 2022 the father responded to the icl’s request for information relating to the father’s travel arrangements for his return to australia. the father was ordered to provide this information to the icl in accordance with order 10(a) of 10 december 2021 orders. the father refused to provide the icl with the information that he was ordered to provide pursuant to order 10(a) of 10 december 2021 orders. further, the father refused to confirm when he was returning to australia or provide a brief report from his medical practitioner as to the treatment he received in country n. the father was ordered to provide this information to the icl pursuant to orders 10(b) and 10(c) of the 10 december 2021 orders. the father’s email correspondence to the icl on 26 january 2022 was again highly abusive towards the icl.[103]
103 during the review application hearing the father stated that he was intending to return the australia on 19 march 2022 on a flight booked with p airlines.[104] the father has not filed any affidavit with this information or any information in relation to his expected quarantine arrangements. further, the father declined to advise the court during the review application hearing as to his vaccination status in relation to covid-19.[105] in these circumstances the court is unable to make any assessment as to the period that the father may be subject to quarantine upon arrival in the commonwealth of australia.
104 the court has very little option in these circumstances, having regard to s.60cc(2)(b) of the act but to take into consideration the father’s behaviour and to act protectively in relation to the child. the court therefore prefers the mother’s proposal and the icl’s proposal.
105 i now consider the additional consideration in s.60cc(3) of the act, to the extent that they are relevant to the application for review.
section 60cc(3)(a) any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child's views,
106 the child was not interviewed to the section 11f report due to her young age. the child is too young to determine what is in her best interests.
section 60cc(3)(b) the nature of the child’s relationship with:(i) each of the child’s parents, and(ii) other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child),each of the child’s parents
107 i refer to an repeat the matters discussed in relation to s.60cc(2)(a).
other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child)
108 the child lives with the mother and her husband, mr d, and e. the child has a relationship with e. mr d has deposed that the child: [...] has developed a very loving and close relationship with e. she is besotted with her. she refers to e as her “baby sister” and loves playing with her.[106]
109 the child has a relationship with the paternal grandmother. i refer to and repeat the matters discussed in relation to s.60cc(2)(b). there is no evidence before the court in relation to nature of the child’s’ relationship with the paternal grandmother.
section 60cc(3)(c) the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:(i) to participate in decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child,(ii) to spend time with the child, and(iii) to communicate with the child,participation in decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child,
110 pursuant to orders 1 and 2 of annexure a of the 30 october 2019 orders the parents have equal shared responsibility for the child and may equally participate in the making of all long term decisions in relation to the child.
111 equal shared parental responsibility for the child has proved to be very difficult for the parents to manage, due to the conflict between the parents. particular problems have arisen in relation to the father’s attitude to the child’s vaccination to covid-19. this issue resulted in the 8 november 2021 orders and the appeal. after the appeal of the 8 november 2021 orders was summarily dismissed by justice austin on 23 december 2021, the father sent an email to the court’s appeals registry and to the mother’s personal email (copied to the icl), which included the following: .] where is the jurisdiction handed down from the high court for your lower court to hear a constitutional matter? austin did not have any idea nor the jurisdiction to hear this matter in the first place. see you in the high court.[107]
112 the father has subsequently filed the father’s 24 january 2022 application in a proceeding, the high court appeal and the father’s 10 february 2022 contravention application.
113 in relation to the child’s education, the father filed the 16 february 2022 application-contravention.
114 i otherwise refer to and repeat the matters discussed under the heading procedural history.
spend time and communicate with the child.
115 the father has not spent any time with the child since early november 2021. order 7 of the 10 december 2021 orders ordered that the child communicate with the father via zoom, or such other electronic means as agreed to in writing, at specified times. order 9 of the 10 december 2021 orders provided that the mother give the child privacy during the zoom calls.
116 in the mother’s 14 february 2022 affidavit the mother stated that the child is spending time with the father in accordance with the 10 december 2021 orders. the mother also stated that she is concerned about some of the comments that the child is making to the mother following these calls.[108] the mother is seeking the discharge of order 9 of the 10 december 2021 orders.
section 60cc(3)(ca) the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child,
117 in the mother’s 9 december 2021 affidavit the mother stated that the father does not pay child support, despite the assessment which provided for the father to pay approximately $635 a month. the mother stated that there was an arrears in child support of $6,203.54. services australia determined that the father’s annual income was approximately $192,000.[109]
section 60cc(3)(d) the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from:(i) either of his or her parents, or(ii) any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child, with whom he or she has been living),either of his or her parents
118 in the mother’s 14 february 2021 affidavit at [14] to [18] the mother described: the child being confused about the circumstances of the father leaving australia, and the improvement in the child’s behaviour since the child has been in the sole care of the mother.
119 it is noted that the child commenced primary school on 1 february 2022 and the mother reports that the child is settled in her routine.[110]
any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child, with whom he or she has been living,
120 this is not a relevant consideration.
section 60cc(3)(f) the capacity of:(i) each of the child’s parents,(ii) any person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child),
to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs,
each of the child’s parents
121 the father’s drug and alcohol history and mental health history is reported in:  the section 11f report, at [13] and [14], (b) dr f’s first affidavit and dr f’s 16 april 2019 report, and (c) dr f’s second affidavit.   dr f’s first affidavit and dr f’s 16 april 2019 report, and (c) dr f’s second affidavit.   dr f’s second affidavit.
122 the father claims that he has a disability as defined within the disability discrimination act.[111] the definition of ‘disability’ in s.4 of the disability discrimination act describes some disabilities, each of which could significantly impact upon the father’s capacity to provide for the needs of the child, including her emotional and intellectual needs.
123 the father has deposed that he is currently located in country n and receiving treatment for his ‘disability’ that is “not available in australia”.[112] the court has no independent medical evidence in relation to the father’s alleged diagnosis of a ‘disability’ pursuant to the disability discrimination act. further, the court has no evidence as to what treatment the father has been receiving in country n.
124 it is alleged by the mother that the father suffers from an opioid dependency.[113] hair follicle test results collected on 24 august 2020 indicated a high level of opioids in the father’s system at the time the test was undertaken.[114] the father’s medication summary prepared by dr q as at 23 september 2020 indicated that the father was prescribed oxycodone hydrochloride and targin mr on a regular basis.[115]
125 the mother is concerned that the father has again reverted to abusing prescription medication and using illicit drugs and that his mental health has deteriorated.[116] i also share those concerns, based upon the recent correspondence that the father has been sending to the icl and the mother, and the number of recent proceedings the father has filed against the mother.
section 60cc(3)(i) the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents,
126 pursuant to order 14 of annexure a to the 22 july 2020 orders the parents were each ordered to enrol in a parenting orders program as soon as practicable. the mother has completed a parenting orders program.[117] there is no evidence before the court that the father has complied with order 14 of annexure a to the 22 july 2020 orders to enrol in a parenting orders program.
127 pursuant to order 3 of annexure a to the 30 november 2020 orders the father was ordered to attend a men’s behavioural change course as soon as reasonably practicable and upon completion, to provide a certificate of completion to the solicitors for the mother and the icl. there is no evidence before the court that the father has complied with order 3 of annexure a to the 30 november 2020 and completed a men’s behavioural change course.
section 60cc(3)(j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family,
128 on 18 april 2019 an intervention order, in favour of the mother and the child was made against the father. on 26 february 2019 a further intervention order was made against the father in favour of the mother and the child at the sunshine magistrates’ court.[118]
129 the intervention order made on 26 february 2020 expired on 25 february 2021. the father is being prosecuted for a breach of the intervention order made on 26 february 2020.[119]
section 60cc(3)(k) if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:(i) nature of the order,(ii) the circumstances in which the order is made,(iii) the any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order,(iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for the order,(v) any other relevant matter,
130 there is no evidence relevant to s.60cc(3)(k) before the court.
section 60cc(3)(l) whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child,
131 at the time of the review application hearing there were seven (7) extant applications between the parties. these are summarised under the heading procedural history at [67]. given the father’s history of filing numerous applications, contravention applications and appeals (including the review application), i consider that the father will continue with this behaviour unless specifically restrained by the court.
section 60cc(3)(m) any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.
132 all matters relevant to this review application have been considered in these reasons for judgment.
conclusion
133 after considering ss.60cc(2) and 60cc(3) of the act and the principles enunciated in rice and asplund, i have determined that there has been a substantial and material change in circumstances subsequent to the making of the 30 october 2019 orders. i therefore determine that pursuant to s.60ca of the act it is in the best interests of the child for the court to reconsider the 30 october 2019 orders.
134 the 10 december 2021 orders were entirely appropriate. it is in the best interests of the child to remain in the mother’s sole care until the father returns to the commonwealth of australia. after the father returns to the commonwealth of australia, a reconsideration of the appropriateness of the 30 october 2019 orders should take place.
135 therefore for the reasons given above, the orders proposed in the mother’s proposal and in the icl’s proposal are in the best interests of the child. i therefore determine that:  the orders made by the senior judicial registrar are affirmed, and (b) the application for review be dismissed.   the application for review be dismissed.
136 orders will be made accordingly.
costs
137 the mother seeks an order that the father pay her costs of and incidental to the application for review. counsel for the icl sought an order that the icl’s costs of and incidental to the application for review be reserved.[120] the father made no submissions in relation to costs.
relevant legislation
138 the general rule in s.117(1) of the act that each party to proceedings shall bear their own costs, is subject to s.117(2) of the act.
139 section 117(1) of the act provides:
subject to subsection (2), subsections 45a(6) and 70nfb(1) and sections 117aa and 117ac each party to proceedings under this act shall bear his or her own costs.
140 section 117(2) of the act provides:
if, in proceedings under this act, the court is of opinion that there are circumstances that justify it in doing so, the court may, subject to subsections (2a), (4), (4a) and (5) and the applicable rules of court, make such order as to costs and security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, as the court considers just.
141 section 117(2a) of the act is relevant for the purposes of this proceeding. section 117(2a) of the act provides: ) in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2), the court shall have regard to:   the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, (b) whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   whether any party to the proceedings is in receipt of assistance by way of legal aid and, if so, the terms of the grant of that assistance to that party, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   such other matters as the court considers relevant.
consideration of costs applications
142 i now turn to consider the costs applications made by the mother and icl.
143 in relation to s.117(2a)(a) of the act, in the mother’s 14 february 2022 affidavit the mother stated that her total legal fees incurred from her previous legal representatives up until 29 november 2021 totalled $46,063. the mother relied upon the mother’s costs notice in relation to her legal fees incurred since 29 november 2021.[121] the mother’s costs notice states that:  in relation to the interim defended hearing, the mother incurred costs of $7,000 and disbursements of $1,850, being a total amount of $8,850,[122] (b) in relation to the hearing before the senior judicial registrar on 16 february 2022, the mother incurred costs of $6,150 and disbursements of $1,850, being a total of $8,000,[123] and (c) in relation to the review application hearing it is estimated that the mother will have incurred costs of $3,300 and disbursements of $1,850, being a total of $5,150.[124]   in relation to the hearing before the senior judicial registrar on 16 february 2022, the mother incurred costs of $6,150 and disbursements of $1,850, being a total of $8,000,[123] and (c) in relation to the review application hearing it is estimated that the mother will have incurred costs of $3,300 and disbursements of $1,850, being a total of $5,150.[124]   in relation to the review application hearing it is estimated that the mother will have incurred costs of $3,300 and disbursements of $1,850, being a total of $5,150.[124]
144 the financial circumstances of the mother are set out in the mother’s financial statement. the mother’s financial statement states that the mother does not have a weekly income and that the father does not pay the child support of $115 a week, which he is required to pay.[125] i otherwise refer to and repeat the discussion in relation to s.60cc(3)(ca) of the act concerning the father’s failure to pay child support.
145 the financial circumstances of the father are set out in the father’s financial statement. in the father’s financial statement the father affirmed that he was employed as a sales representative with an average weekly income of $2,769.[126]
146 in relation to s.117(2a)(b) of the act, neither the mother or the father are in receipt of legal aid.[127] the icl is funded by victoria legal aid.
147 in relation to s.117(2a)(c) of the act, the father has issued multiple applications against the mother which have been discussed above under the heading procedural history. many of these applications have been without merit and have either been dismissed by order of the court or by consent. a summary of the matters which remained extant between the parties at the time of the review application is at [67] of these reasons for judgment.
148 in relation to s.117(2a)(d) of the act, as discussed at [68] to [70] under the heading father’s proposal, the father has failed to comply with procedural orders which related directly to the conduct of the review application hearing.
149 in relation to s.117(2a)(e) of the act, the father has been wholly unsuccessful in relation to the application for review. the application for review lacked any reasonable prospect of success and yet the father insisted on proceeding with the review application hearing.
150 in relation to s.117(2a)(f) of the act, the court is not aware of any matter relevant to this consideration.
151 in relation to s.117(2a)(g) of the act, i take into account the highly abusive email correspondence that the father has sent to the icl and to the mother, in particular the father’s email correspondence sent on 22 december 2021 and 26 january 2022.[128] i also take into account the father’s attempt to remove the icl by filing the father’s 6 january 2022 application in a proceeding, which was dismissed by the senior judicial registrar on 16 february 2022 by order of the court.[129]
costs applications - conclusion
152 having considered ss.117(1), (2) and (2a) of the act, i determine that it is appropriate to exercise my discretion and make the orders sought by the mother and the icl in relation to costs as follows:  the father pay the mother’s costs of and incidental to the application for review, and (b) the icl’s costs of and incidental to the application for review be reserved.   the icl’s costs of and incidental to the application for review be reserved.
153 orders will be made accordingly.
