reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
to mr kinji, i and x are leaving this place today. i don’t think our relationship is family.[2]
...a confidential student transfer is undertaken only when the need for it is supported by evidence provided by sa police, the department for child protection, and/or support providers such as crisis shelters or domestic violence support centres.[3]
by necessary implication the department considered that such a change of school was warranted so far as x was concerned. the father disputes this and feels his parental authority had been circumvented by the relevant authorities with the mother’s connivance.
the child inclusive conference  haru] alleged that [mr kinji] is easily angered, overly critical of [x], verbally abusive towards [x] and uses cruel punishments to teach [x] ‘lessons’. [ms haru] reported that [mr kinji’s] relentless emotional abuse of [x], led to [x] suffering with depression and anxiety and not wanting to get out of bed for approximately six months in 2020. [ms haru] alleged that [mr kinji] does not “understand feelings”. [mr kinji] stated that discussing ‘feelings’ and having open communication was something that was avoided in [country f] culture. he denied emotionally abusing [x]. he stated that he believes spraying and soaking [x] in cold water, to remind her to water the potatoes in their garden, is a reasonable method of teaching her responsibility.[4]  , presented as an open and articulate young person, who had a growing sense and awareness of what constitutes appropriate discipline. she also presented as hyper vigilant to sounds and noises occurring around her. when the writer opened the door to the main childcare area, the writer observed [x] ‘startle’ almost as if she had to brace herself from an attack, and with what appeared to be a look of fear on her face. she was gently reassured that she was safe by the childcare worker, which appeared to alleviate her initial reaction of fear. she stated she was scared it was her father entering the main childcare area. [x] is in year 5. she likes school and has many friends. she loves to read and draw. she reported being significantly happier since moving away from her old school. within the first several minutes of her interview, [x] began to cry softly. she cried for the majority of her interview when speaking about her father. she disclosed multiple distressing memories she has in regard to [mr kinji]. she stated that talking about them makes her sad and anxious. [x]’s affect during her interview was consistent with her narrative and she presented as confused and plagued by her memories of [mr kinji]. [x] disclosed several detailed accounts of times that she felt poorly treated, emotionally pressured, emotionally abused and/or saddened by her father’s comments and/or actions. she provided a level of detail that suggested the incidents had occurred. [x]’s narrative suggested that she had recently felt emotional pressure during phone contact with [mr kinji], to rewrite/restate her experiences in order for him to ‘look better’ in these proceedings. overall, [x] painted a picture of her father as someone she was extremely fearful of and someone who had emotionally and verbally abused her over a significant period. [x]’s presentation during her interview left the writer concerned that [x] had experienced a significant level of trauma that may be affecting her emotional wellbeing and that which may explain some of her hyper vigilant behaviours. the hyper vigilant behaviours exhibited and described by [x] are consistent with someone who has experienced trauma.[5]
other relevant facts
on 5 september 2021 we arrived ten minutes early. [x] refused to go to see the father. the service coordinators and i all tried to encourage [x] to go and see the father in some way, even just to wave to him, but she refused. after a while of trying to get [x] to see the father, [x] became upset and said she wanted to leave. the service coordinators allowed us leave instead of continuing to pressure [x] to see the father. when we left [x] said to me ‘how many times do i have to say no, i don’t want to see him again’.[7]
we have received information that indicates that the father is actively engaging in violent behaviours, which is contradictory to the behaviour that is required for successful reunification therapy. in addition, the nature of the reports lead me to have concerns about the safety of the mother and the child at the office. consequently i am withdrawing my services.[10]
i disagree that [x] is bearing the responsibility of parenting decisions. i have tried everything i can to get [x] to see her father. she has consistently refused and has become distressed. i am only able to push so much before i need to stop and respect [x]’s wishes or risk severely damaging our relationship and her willingness to trust me.[13]
the child was intelligent and reflective. she spoke about experiences like snorkelling with her father, and how his behaviour made her afraid of water due to his lack of sensitivity to her anxiety about deep water. the child also spoke about feeling as though she had to hide the strength of her relationship she has with her mother from the father as she felt that her father struggled with this. the child spoke about secreting phone calls to her mother whilst the father and she camped. the child insinuates a level of anxiety in her relationship with her father, stating that if she does something wrong, he "would shout at me". furthermore, she lacks confidence in his capacity to change, as she said that the last time the mother left the father, he promised to change and he did not. in speaking with the child, she articulated the detrimental effect having parents who were in chronic conflict had on her mental health. she also spoke about her struggles with the father denigrating the mother to her. this is a significant issue for the child, and something the father will need to address as part of his attempts to repair his relationship with the child.[14]
this information that was provided, along with the information that the father attended the child’s [m] program unexpectedly, gave rise to the concern that the father was behaving in a way which falls under the umbrella of family violence. such behaviour does not give faith to the therapist that the father would not unexpectedly attend the adelaide resolutions centre offices and given the allegations made in that letter, it is likely that the mother would be in a heightened state of anxiety when attending which is not conducive to an optimal therapeutic environment which is required for the purpose of reunification therapy.[15]
legal principles applicable
decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing.
i remind the parties that i am not deciding final arrangements for the parenting of x in the context of the current proceedings.
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.
conclusions
apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.
...it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children’s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children’s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s ability to care for the children.
