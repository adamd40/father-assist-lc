proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answer questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters.  there was an absence of offers by the mother and she has significantly frustrated the proceedings through baseless allegations of,

mother persisted with her claims that the children were reluctant to spend time with the father and were even afraid of him.  ) throughout the proceedings and the final hearing the mother persisted with her claims that the children were reluctant to spend time with the father and were even afraid of him.   the mother made family violence allegations against the father, and alleged that the father had also been observed by others to be aggressive, dishonest and manipulative. she alleged that the father finds it difficult to contain his anger unless there is surveillance, (b) the mother had alleged the children have witnessed the father physically and emotionally abusing the mother, and had also been subject to physical and emotional discipline from the father, which has left them feeling afraid, (c) the mother alleged her concern about the father’s use of alcohol during the marriage and the correlation between his alcohol use and violence. she alleges that since separation she believes the father may still be drinking to excess and that might be impacting on his capacity to regulate his emotions, (d) the mother proposed on a final basis, inter alia, that the children spend from friday 3 pm to 5 pm on sunday during term time with the father, (e) the father stated to the family report writer that his communication with the mother was very poor, (f) the mother alleged to the family report writer that the children have never enjoyed a good relationship with the father both prior to the separation and since, (g) the mother alleged to the family report writer that her communication with the father was fraught and she was afraid of him. she alleged that the level of mistrust between the parties was extremely high and she could not imagine their parenting relationship improving, (h) the child x, date of birth in 2010, told the family report writer that she would like to stay with the father for one evening per fortnight only as she misses the mother too much, (i) the child y born in 2012, told the family report writer that he would like to stay with the father for a longer period of time, (j) the family report writer stated that the views of the children should be given minimal weight, (k) the family report writer stated that both parties are afraid that the other is behaving in a way that denigrates them to the children or that significant others are implicated, (l) the family report writer stated that if there was any truth to the allegations made about the behaviour of the other it would suggest a significant level of immaturity in the way the parties have conducted themselves since the separation, (m) the family report writer stated that the communication between the parties is fraught and mistrust so high that it was difficult to envisage how, without significant changes, they could move forward and implement orders for shared parental responsibility. she stated that in the past two years since separation the parties have been unable to demonstrate a capacity to communicate in a child focused way. she stated that the capacity of the parties to exercise parental responsibility jointly was impeded by them maintaining extremely negative narratives of the other and their parenting capacities. in this context the family report writer stated that the mother accuses the father of being violent and abusive to her and to the children and having oversights in his attention to the children’s needs, (n) the family report writer stated that the parties may benefit from engaging with a therapist who specialises in family law to help them rebuild their trust, explore ways of communicating in a more collaborative way and appreciate the damaging impact on the children being involved in the adult issues, (o) the family

between the parties, including violence allegations. the family report writer stated that the court would need to decide the extent and nature of family violence that existed in the family. she stated

both parties seem to present with some personality traits that are characterised by need for control, rigidity and lack of openness to views that do not concur with their own. she stated that the parties’ inflexible views of the other and unwillingness to appreciate that the other parent has the children’s best interests at heart may lead them to behave in ways that placed the children and their relationship with each parent at risk, (r) the family report writer recommended, inter alia, that the children live with the mother, that the time that the children spend with the father be incrementally increased by one evening every three months so that they eventually spend 4 to 5 evenings per fortnight with the father, school holidays and special occasions be shared between the parties.   the mother had alleged the children have witnessed the father physically and emotionally abusing the mother, and had also been subject to physical and emotional discipline from the father,

has the children’s best interests at heart may lead them to behave in ways that placed the children and their relationship with each parent at risk, (r) the family report writer recommended, inter alia, that the children live with the mother, that the time that the children spend with the father be incrementally increased by one evening every three months so that they eventually spend 4 to 5 evenings per fortnight with the father, school holidays and special occasions be shared between the parties.   the child y born in 2012, told the family report writer that he would like to stay with the father for a longer period of time, (j) the family report writer stated that the views of the children should be given minimal weight, (k) the family report writer stated that both parties are afraid that the other is behaving in a way that denigrates them to the children or that significant others are implicated, (l) the family report writer stated that if there was any truth to the allegations made about the behaviour of the other it would suggest a significant level of immaturity in the way the parties have conducted themselves since the separation, (m) the family report writer stated that the communication between the parties is fraught and mistrust so high that it was difficult to envisage how, without significant changes, they could move forward and implement orders for shared parental responsibility. she stated that in the past two years since separation the parties have been unable to demonstrate a capacity to communicate in a child focused way. she stated that the capacity of the parties to exercise parental responsibility jointly was impeded by them maintaining extremely negative narratives of the other and their parenting capacities. in this context the family report writer stated that the mother accuses the father of being violent and abusive to her and to the children and having oversights in his attention to the children’s needs, (n) the family report writer stated that the parties may benefit from engaging with a therapist who specialises in family law to help them rebuild their trust, explore ways of communicating in a more collaborative way and appreciate the damaging impact on the children being involved in the adult issues, (o) the family report writer stated the parties are massively wary and suspicious of each other and these proceedings have brought out some unbecoming allegations, including violence allegations between them sometimes in the view of the children as well as aggression directed towards the children, (p) the family report writer stated that it was difficult to disentangle the veracity of the allegations made between the parties, including violence allegations. the family report writer stated that the court would need to decide the extent and nature of family violence that existed in the family. she stated that if such violence was as serious as the mother alleged, her fear of the father and apprehensions for the children would be warranted, (court’s italics) (q) the family report writer stated that both parties seem to present with some personality traits that are characterised by need for control, rigidity and lack of openness to views that do not concur with their own. she stated that the parties’ inflexible views of the other and unwillingness to appreciate that the other parent
