reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
we were married in 1998. there are no children of the relationship, although ms cottrell does have two children from a prior relationship, and in around 2004, we started looking after her two grandchildren ms f and ms g. in around 2010, ms cottrell formally adopted her grandchildren.[5]
the interests of each joint tenant in the land held are always the same in respect of possession, interest, title and time. no distinction can be drawn between the interest of any one tenant and that of any other tenant. if one joint tenant dies his interest is extinguished. he falls out, and the interest of the surviving joint tenant or joint tenants is correspondingly enlarged.[10]
in the same case, dixon j (as his honour then was) held that  n contemplation of law joint tenants are jointly seised for the whole estate they take in land and no one of them has a distinct or separate title, interest or possession.[11]
relevant legal provisions
it will be recalled that s 79(2) provides that ‘[t]he court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order’. section 79(4) prescribes matters that must be taken into account in considering what order (if any) should be made under the section. the requirements of the two sub-sections are not to be conflated. in every case in which a property settlement order under s 79 is sought, it is necessary to satisfy the court that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[14]   where, before property settlement proceedings are completed, a party to the marriage dies:   the proceedings may be continued by or against, as the case may be, the legal personal representative of the deceased party and the applicable rules of court may make provision in relation to the substitution of the legal personal representative as a party to the proceedings, (b) if the court is of the opinion: (i) that it would have made an order with respect to property if the deceased party had not died, and (ii) that it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate with respect to: (iii) any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or (iv) any of the vested bankruptcy property in relation to a bankrupt party to the marriage, and (c) an order made by the court pursuant to paragraph (b) may be enforced on behalf of, or against, as the case may be, the estate of the deceased party.
the death of a spouse will not always extinguish or satisfy the moral claims of the surviving spouse and children to which effect would have been given if the proceedings had been completed. section 79(8) empowers the family court to give effect to the moral claims in respect of the property of the spouses which was made available to answer those claims by the commencement of the proceedings, provided “it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property”: s. 79(8)(b)(ii). that qualification on the power, coupled with par. (ca)(i) of the definition of “matrimonial cause”, ensure that the jurisdiction is exercised only in cases where the moral obligations arising out of the marriage remain unsatisfied. section 79(8) provides machinery for the discharge of those moral obligations in priority to any rights in the property of a party to a marriage which arise by testamentary disposition of that party’s property or by any other devolution of that property on that party’s death.
gibbs cj (with whom wilson j agreed) said:
it is true that s. 79(8) provides for the creation of new proprietary rights after a marriage has been terminated by death. however, those rights may be created only if proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them had been commenced while the marriage was subsisting and only if the proceedings are continued by or against the legal personal representative of the deceased spouse, further we are concerned only with the case in which the proceedings arose out of the marital relationship. an order may be made under the subsection only if the family court is of the opinion that it would have made an order with respect to property if the deceased party had not died and that it is still appropriate to make an order with respect to property. we are not concerned to consider in what circumstances it would be appropriate to make an order that would benefit complete strangers, but clearly the discretionary power to make an order under s. 79(8)(b) should not be exercised lightly.[16]
section 79(8)(b) thus requires a court considering an application for a property settlement order which is continued by or against the legal personal representative of a deceased party to determine first, whether it would have made an order with respect to property if the deceased party had not died and second, whether, despite the death, it is still appropriate to make an order. both of those inquiries require consideration of section 79(2) and its direction that the court not make an order unless "satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable" to do so. it follows that, in cases where section 79(8)(b) applies, a court must consider whether, had the party not died, it would have been just and equitable to make an order and whether, the party having died, it is still just and equitable to make an order.[17]  hat the court really looks to is the contributions based entitlement of the deceased party, which the surviving party has a moral obligation to meet, and to then ask whether that entitlement should be adjusted for section 75(2) factors relating to the surviving spouse, or for any other reason.[20]
specific controversies relating to the sole occupancy issue
it was always ms cottrell’s wish that the real property be left to her grandchildren. she fostered my sister and i growing up and the real property was our family home for many years. i continue to spend time there and for the past 3-4 years i have been assisting in the maintenance and upkeep of the property.[23]
legal principles relating to sole occupancy
114(1)...the court may make such order or grant such injunction as it considers proper with respect to the matter to which the proceedings relate, including – ... (b) an injunction restraining a party to the marriage from entering or remaining in the matrimonial home or the premises in which the other party to the marriage resides, or restraining a party to the marriage from entering or remaining in a specified area, being an area in which the matrimonial home is, or the premises in which the other party to the marriage resides are, situated, ... (e) an injunction in relation to the property of a party to the marriage, (f) an injunction relating to the use or occupancy of the matrimonial home.  s it really sensible to expect a wife ... to endure the pressures which the continued presence of the other spouse will place upon them.[27]  he court should regard the situation between the parties as being such that it would not be reasonable or sensible or practicable to expect them to continue to remain in the home together.[28]
