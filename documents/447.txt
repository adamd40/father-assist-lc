reasons for judgment
judge demack
harm statements [x] has not been harmed. complicating factors the things that make it harder for the adults to protect the children are: [mr c bridges] has been convicted of sexually assaulting his step-daughter and [x]’s half-sister, [f]. [ms wyatt]’s other children, [f], [g] and [h] were recently assessed as requiring out-of-home care. they are placed with a kinship carer, [ms wyatt]’s sister, [ms k], on the [region o]. [mr c bridges] is a cpor (child protection registry offender) offender, which means he is subject to a higher level of monitoring following his release from prison that would be required in a standard parole arrangement.
acts of protection and belonging mr bridges made an application to family law court to custody and parental responsibility of [x], because he was worried that [x] would be neglected and/or exposed to drug use in [ms wyatt]’s care. strengths and resources the things that make it easier for the adults to protect the children are: probation and parole and qps believe that [mr c bridges] poses a low risk of sexual abuse to [x], as [mr c bridges] has always maintained that he is not sexually interested in boys or biological family members. [mr bridges] is aware of [mr c bridges]’s criminal history, believes that it happened, and does not minimise the seriousness of it. [mr bridges] has also set up the family’s lifestyle to reduce risk to [x], e.g. making sure that [x] and [mr c bridges] are usually supervised when they are both home, and setting boundaries around privacy in the home. there are family law court orders granting sole responsibility for caring for [x] to [mr bridges]. [x] also demonstrated an age-appropriate understanding of sexuality and sexual boundaries. he was able to name the body parts, including their proper names, and knew that nobody is allowed to touch or look at his private parts, ask him to touch or look at their private parts, or show him pictures or videos of private parts.
i have assessed that [mr bridges] is a parent willing and able to care for [x] and keep him safe, for the following reasons. there are family law court orders granting sole parental responsibility of [x] to [mr bridges]. this means that family law court have assessed that [mr bridges] is a parent willing and able to care for [x]. [mr bridges] is aware of [mr c bridges]’s criminal conviction of sexually assaulting [mr c bridges]’s step-daughter. [mr bridges] does not deny, minimise or justify this serious offence. [mr bridges] demonstrated an understanding of [mr c bridges]’s reporting requirements, and ways in which he can order the family’s lifestyle to reduce any risk to [x]. (probation and parole and the police have assessed that [mr c bridges] poses a low risk to [x], as [mr c bridges] reports that he is not attracted to girls or biological family members). [x] demonstrated an age-appropriate understanding of sexuality and protective boundaries. he identified that [mr bridges] is a safe person who would help him if he felt unsafe.
i have assessed that [mr c bridges] is not a parent willing and able to care for [x] and keep him safe. while [mr c bridges] may provide daily care for [x] from time to time, [mr bridges] is [x]’s only legal guardian and primary carer on 17 june 2020, [ms wyatt] was assessed as a parent not willing and able to care for [h], [g] and [f], resulting in child protection orders for all three girls. i have not assessed her as a parent with regard to [x] as she is not able to exercise parental responsibility for [x] due to family law court orders. outcome the outcome for this i & a will be recorded as unsubstantiated – child not in need of protection.
it is deeply concerning that the mother, in interview for this update report, and in interview for the writer’s earlier report, suggested that she had received a “wake-up call” with respect to her drug abuse and other lifestyle choices, and is taking positive steps to address those matters. again, there appears to have been a pattern of behaviour with the mother making such assertions repeatedly over quite a number of years to the department of child safety, whenever she has had engagement with that authority, and yet, the issues and concerns noted in child safety material remain consistent today, with those matters raised over many years, dating back to at least 2010 [and earlier as a child herself]. child concern reports, and notifications received by the department over many years reveal ongoing themes with respect to the mother, of: alcohol and drug abuse, domestic violence, transience, neglect of the children’s basic care needs, lack of supervision of the children, and inadequately addressed mental health issues. it is noted throughout subpoenaed material from the department of child safety youth and women, that the mother has a propensity to decline assistance from external agencies when offered, and claiming to no longer have any issues that would negatively impact on her parenting capacity.
despite the mother’s very recent engagement in programmes recommended by child safety services, the writer notes a pattern of behaviour by the mother in previous years of seemingly positive engagement of similar nature for periods of time, but subsequent reversion to lifestyle choices that place her children at unacceptable risk of harm. the child protection themes that have been noted, have been consistent over many years, and the inevitable conclusion to be drawn is that the mother’s lifestyle choices are deeply entrenched and she has not, in any meaningful way demonstrated a capacity for sustained change over any significant period of time. .
