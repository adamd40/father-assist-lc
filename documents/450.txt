background
legal principles
“thus, the essential importance of the unacceptable risk question as i see it is in its direction to judges to give real and substantial consideration to the facts of the case, and to decide whether or not, and why or why not, those facts could be said to raise an unacceptable risk of harm to the child. thus, the value of the expression is not in a magical provision of an appropriate standard, but in its direction to judges to consider deeply where the facts of a particular case fall, and explain adequately their findings in this regard.”
“25. efforts to define with greater precision the magnitude of the risk which will justify a court in denying a parent access to a child have resulted in a variety of formulations. the degree of risk has been described as a "risk of serious harm" (a v a [1976] vicrp 24, (1976) vr 298, at p 300), "an element of risk" or "an appreciable risk" (marriage of m [1986] famca 62, (1987) 11 fam lr 765, at p 770 and p 771 respectively), "a real possibility" (b. v. b. (access) [1986] famca 52, (1986) flc 91-758, at p 75,545), a "real risk" (leveque v leveque (1983) 54 b clr 164, at p 167), and an "unacceptable risk" (in re g. (a minor) (1987) 1 wlr 1461, at p 1469). this imposing array indicates that the courts are striving for a greater degree of definition than the subject is capable of yielding. in devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from ...abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. to achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of... abuse.”
competing proposals of the parties
“if the court were to find that [mr janzen] should be meaningfully involved in the children’s lives and that he is not an unacceptable risk to the children, i seek a graduated time arrangement of, say, an initial 2 hours each sunday after lunch for 4 visits, with changeover inside the mcdonalds... at [suburb e]...thereafter each sunday morning at the start of their swimming lessons at the [region f] leisure centre at [suburb e] or at 9am if swimming are not being held until 4pm...for 4 visits and thereafter every second weekend from 2.00pm on saturday... until sunday at 4.pm for a period of 3 months. thereafter each alternate week from 2.00pm on saturday until the start of school on tuesday. this would fit much more easily into their normal pattern, including their football games in case we have to travel and get back in time for changeover, without placing them under too much stress or exposing them to too much conflict between [mr janzen] and me”
“the father is undergoing a course of treatment, including residential treatment in respect of issues relating to his mental health and/or alcohol use. the father advises the court that he seeks to increase his time with the children upon there being a substantial and significant change in those circumstances”.
evidence
the father
the mother
“both boys have similar issues with dysregulated behaviours and poor focus at school. this comes of a complicated background including alleged exposure to significant domestic violence from their father”[22]
“throughout 2017 and 2018, i witnessed [mr janzen] using cocaine. on one occasion he and his friend snorted cocaine worth $2,000.00”[23]
evidence of ms j
evidence of the family consultant  there is always a risk of relapse. during the twelve month period following residential treatment a person is most at risk of relapsing. abstinence from alcohol for twelve months post residential treatment is a good indicator that a person has addressed their alcohol abuse issue and is able to maintain abstinence. (b) there is a lower risk of relapse if a person engages in relapse prevention therapy such as drug and alcohol counselling or attendance at alcoholics anonymous. (c) she is hesitant to recommend block periods for the children with the father currently having heard the additional information in relation to his alcohol abuse last year. (d) she expressed surprise and concern that the children are still engaged in trauma counselling due to their exposure to ms c’s behaviour in april 2018. she noted that the incident was a one-off, and she said that years of trauma counselling for children of this age is probably re-confirming or cementing the trauma and she is sceptical as to the need for ongoing counselling. the goal of trauma therapy for children is to work towards a resolution, to manage anxiety and the triggers, and to manage the children’s behaviours. the aim of trauma counselling is to help the children to manage and to emotionally cope with life. (e) she understood the mother’s concern that spending time with the father in an unsupervised situation may trigger the children, and she suggested that any current therapy for the children could run alongside any arrangement for the children to spend time with the father, and that it would be helpful for the therapist to work with the father and provide him with feedback. (f) ms h expressed concern as to which therapist has made a diagnosis of the children suffering from ptsd, noting that there has been no input from the father into any assessments of the children. (g) ms h is supportive of the father receiving information from the children’s schools and supports a continuation of his involvement in the children’s schooling. she agreed that it would be helpful if the father is able to speak to the children’s teachers and attend parent teacher meetings. she supports the father’s involvement in the children’s extracurricular activities, subject to the proviso that the court finds it less likely that there will be conflict between the parents. (h) ms h agreed with the proposition that in this matter it is not a case of there being no risk, and that the appropriate questions to ask are whether any risks are unacceptable or whether such risks can be managed. (i) ms h is uncomfortable with the father’s proposal for automatic progression of the children’s time with him from daytime to overnight time. she is of the opinion that the father needs to focus on his own health particularly alcohol abuse and depression, and taking into account whether there is evidence that that the father has self-harmed in the past.   there is a lower risk of relapse if a person engages in relapse prevention therapy such as drug and alcohol counselling or attendance at alcoholics anonymous. (c) she is hesitant to recommend block periods for the children with the father currently having heard the additional information in relation to his alcohol abuse last year. (d) she expressed surprise and concern that the children are still engaged in trauma counselling due to their exposure to ms c’s behaviour in april 2018. she noted that the incident was a one-off, and she said that years of trauma counselling for children of this age is probably re-confirming or cementing the trauma and she is sceptical as to the need for ongoing counselling. the goal of trauma therapy for children is to work towards a resolution, to manage anxiety and the triggers, and to manage the children’s behaviours. the aim of trauma counselling is to help the children to manage and to emotionally cope with life.

(d) she expressed surprise and concern that the children are still engaged in trauma counselling due to their exposure to ms c’s behaviour in april 2018. she noted that the incident was a one-off, and she said that years of trauma counselling for children of this age is probably re-confirming or cementing the trauma and she is sceptical as to the need for ongoing counselling. the goal of trauma therapy for children is to work towards a resolution, to manage anxiety and the triggers, and to manage the children’s behaviours. the aim of trauma counselling is to help the children to manage and to emotionally cope with life. (e) she understood the mother’s concern that spending time with the father in an unsupervised situation may trigger the children, and she suggested that any current therapy for the children could run alongside any arrangement for the children to spend time with the father, and that it would be helpful for the therapist to work with the father and provide him with feedback. (f) ms h expressed concern as to which therapist has made a diagnosis of the children suffering from ptsd, noting that there has been no input from the father into any assessments of the children.
