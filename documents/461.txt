physical violence
mr morton has subjected me to physical, verbal, emotional, financial and sexual abuse. as a result of mr morton's ongoing conduct, i felt belittled, manipulated, and pressured sexually throughout our relationship. i was very emotionally fragile, and my confidence and self-esteem became very low during my time with mr morton.[9]
coercive control and ‘q’
... mr morton would typically go onto a site called r site which was a site to locate men who wanted to have sex with a female in front of another man. mr morton would invite a man who would come around to my house after x was asleep. the man who was a stranger would then have sexual encounters with me, while mr morton watched and/or sometimes became involved. mr morton would video these encounters. i believe mr morton would still have these videos as mr morton had shown me old videos and photos. ... mr morton would also tell me that i should work as a prostitute.[20]

efforts to define with greater precision the magnitude of the risk which will justify a court in denying a parent access to a child have resulted in a variety of formulations. ... courts are striving for a greater degree of definition than the subject is capable of yielding. in devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child’s paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. to achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse. it is to be remembered that the concept of “unacceptable risk” referred to in m v m was within the framework of resolving “the wider issue” namely what is in the best interests of the child and to which the resolution of the existence of an “unacceptable risk” is subservient (see m v m at 76, b and b [1993] famca 143, (1993) flc 92-357). the process by which a risk is identified and its magnitude measured cannot, in parenting cases, be subject to rigid mathematical or empirical assessment. as the high court said in cdj v vaj (1998) 197 clr 172 (cdj v vaj) at 218: 151....given the nature of applications for parenting orders, there must often be a real chance that the order under appeal is not in the best interests of the child. such applications necessarily involve predictions and assumptions about the future which are not susceptible of scientific demonstration or proof. perceptions, predictions and even intuition and guesswork can all play a part in the making of an order. ... as long ago as 1995, in n and s and the separate representative [1995] famca 139, (1996) flc 92-655 at 82,713–82,714, fogarty j said of this determination: thus, the essential importance of the unacceptable risk question as i see it is in its direction to judges to give real and substantial consideration to the facts of the case, and to decide whether or not, and why or why not, those facts could be said to raise an unacceptable risk of harm to the child.

it is ... seminal to the proper exercise of judicial discretion to understand not only the source of the power to make an order but the ambit of it.[46]
standard of proof
140 civil proceedings: standard of proof
in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject‑matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged. [49]
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.[50]

sometimes i would do it wrong, after the other male left he would degrade and physically abuse me for doing it wrong. if i did not attend his needs in the bedroom every morning he would either not get up or would wake up moody, grumpy and on edge. mr morton put me at risk of getting pregnant or contracting sti’s from these men as he wouldn’t allow protection to be used as that doesn’t fit with his fantasies/fetishes. at one point i thought i may have had an infection. mr morton tried to prevent me from going to the doctor to seek help and made me put up with it for a number of weeks as he didn’t want me to say anything to the doctor about how i may have contracted it. mr morton would want me to say dirty sexual things to him about what i have done or would do to other males. if i couldn’t say what he wanted to hear then he would abuse me and belittle me and say he’ll get someone else who can do it properly. towards the end of our relationship he attempted to force me into prostitution and sexual massaging as a job, i left before this idea could progress any further.  bruary 2020] father:

conclusion with respect to x’s best interests under s 60cc
parental responsibility  this section applies if, under a parenting order: (a) 2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child, and (b) the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long-term issue in relation to the child.   2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child, and (b) the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long-term issue in relation to the child.   the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long-term issue in relation to the child.   the order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons. (3) the order is taken to require each of those persons: (a) to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and (b) to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and (b) to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons, that the decision has been made jointly.
... issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about: (a) the child's education (both current and future), and (b) the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent. to avoid doubt, a decision by a parent of a child to form a relationship with a new partner is not, of itself, a major long-term issue in relation to the child. however, the decision will involve a major long-term issue if, for example, the relationship with the new partner involves the parent moving to another area and the move will make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with the other parent.   the child's education (both current and future), and (b) the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children,   parents should agree about the future parenting of their children,
in those situations, there can be little doubt that, appropriately, parties share parental responsibility (as defined). yet, common experience shows that parental responsibility (or, at least, aspects of it, for example, responsibilities and duties) is - for a variety of reasons, some born of necessity, others not - by no means always, or even frequently, shared equally. the act (s 65dac) makes it clear that sharing parental responsibility in respect of “major long-term issues” is not a passive activity, it requires those sharing parental responsibility to make joint decisions and to consult and attempt to reach agreement in order to do so. carrying out those tasks and obligations, on what might be a regular basis, particularly when, as here, a child is young, carries with it potential significant difficulties. that is all the more so where, for example, parties other than the parents are involved, there are siblings of another relationship involved and where the parties are in high conflict. all three are present here. equally, though, an order for “sole parental responsibility” in favour of a party (as is frequently sought as an alternative to either the sharing of parental responsibility or equal shared parental responsibility) means, as it seems to me, that the other party has no rights, responsibilities and authority in respect of “major long term issues” for the children save as expressly ordered. (decisions in respect of day to day issues are specifically provided for: note to s 65dae(1)). the exercise of discretion in favour of excluding one parent from consultation and decision making in respect of major long-term issues for a child - particularly when, as here, the child is young – is, it seems to me, a very significant step, being a very serious interference with the fundamental rights of a person.[178]
for the reasons discussed in blaze v grady [2015] famca 1064 ... the legislative intent of part vii of the act is to focus upon rights of children, on the one hand, and duties, obligations and responsibilities of parents on the other. viewed in this context, the allocation of parental responsibility by parenting orders made under part vii does not have in focus some inchoate or accepted right of a parent to exercise parental responsibility. rather, the focus must be on the rights of the child, that is the child’s right to have the child’s parents properly meeting their parental duties and obligations, including by their discharge of parental responsibility. that forms an important element of the child’s right to have parents having a meaningful involvement in the child’s life.[179]
the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility: legal principles and operation  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. (2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or (b) family violence.   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or (b) family violence.   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or (b) family violence.   family violence.   the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
applicability of presumption of equal shared parental responsibility 61da(2)] does not say that, if there are reasonable grounds to believe one of the nominated circumstances exists, equal shared parental responsibility, qualified or unqualified, shall not be ordered, but merely that the presumption does not apply (at all).[185]

equal time or substantial and significant time?
65daa court to consider child spending equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent in certain circumstances equal time   subject to subsection (6), if a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, the court must: (a) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (b) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (b) consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   consider whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (c) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.   if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents.
substantial and significant time (2) subject to subsection (6), if:   a parenting order provides (or is to provide) that a child’s parents are to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child, and (b) the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents,   the court does not make an order (or include a provision in the order) for the child to spend equal time with each of the parents,
the court must:   consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents would be in the best interests of the child, and (d) consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable, and (e) if it is, consider making an order to provide (or including a provision in the order) for the child to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents.

icl’s proposal (n 51), [38].[70] for the purpose of x’s time with the father from 2023 onwards, the mother proposes (at [15]) that the father needs to have (i) undertaken at least four visits with x in 2022, (ii) completed a drug and alcohol counselling course (and certify his completion of the same), and (iii) completed psychological counselling for his risk-taking sexual behaviour (and certify his completion of the same). the mother seeks that the icl be permitted to provide the parenting orders and family report to the father’s treating counsellor and/or psychologist for this purpose.[71] father’s proposal (n 51), [24].[72] ibid [13].[73] family law act 1975 (n 35) s 68b. the icl’s proposal concludes with an order seeking the injunction as a separate order given the sensitive nature of the issue. with the order in those terms now made i do not have to address that aspect of the icl’s proposal in these reasons. see also the father’s proposal (n 51), [26], which proposes an injunction in substantially identical terms and which, the injunction having been made, does not need to be addressed.[74] icl’s proposal (n 51), [9].[75] ibid [30].[76] family law act 1975 (n 35) s 65dac.[77] ibid s 4 (definition of ‘major long-term issues’, (c)).[78] for discussion of the meaning of ‘unacceptable risk’ see paragraphs 54-58 of these reasons.[79] father’s proposal (n 51), [3(b)], for one weekend in june 2022 from 5pm friday until 6pm sunday, with changeover to occur at the city d contact centre.[80] mother’s proposal (n 51), [4(a)(ii)], [16], noting that [16] permits the mother to telephone x on his birthday, the mother’s birthday, christmas day, and easter sunday if x is not in her care, but the terms of [4(a)(ii)] are framed somewhat differently, in that x shall communicate with the father on christmas day, easter sunday, the father’s birthday, and x’s own birthday of not spending time with the father for no less than 20 minutes unless x terminates the call unilaterally.[81] father’s proposal (n 51), [6.1.4];

i have extracted his reasoning because his assessment is consistent with the wording of s 61da(2), and with the concept of the presumption as a legal mechanism which does not prevent an order being made in pursuance of s 60ca.[186] mr reeve also submitted that the evidence was insufficient to make a finding of family violence against the father but, by virtue of his admission of physical violence on 14 february 2020, my corresponding finding of physical family violence at paragraph 259, and my finding of coercive control at paragraph 287, that submission is irrelevant.[187] family report (n 100), [148].[188] mrr v gr (n 38), [37].[189] family law act 1975 (n 35) ss 65daa(2), 65daa(5).[190] ibid s 65daa(3)(a).[191] ibid s 65dac(4).
