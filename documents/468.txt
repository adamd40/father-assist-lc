credit  in november/december 2017 the parties had engaged architects to design, inter alia, a house together with livestock amenities, shelters, feed shed, on acreage property (about 20 acres) at town q nsw (hereinafter referred to as “the property”) purchased by the respondent in about mid 2017, (b) in july 2018 and early august 2018 the parties had discussed buying a livestock transport business,   in july 2018 and early august 2018 the parties had discussed buying a livestock transport business,  e court interpolates here that the respondent alleged that he ended the parties’ relationship, being a mere boyfriend and girlfriend relationship, in early september 2018.)   in october 2018 the parties had established a livestock transport business, with the respondent providing the purchase price, (d) on 17 december 2018 the respondent had emailed the architects referring to discussions that had occurred with the respondent, the applicant and the respondent’s children in relation to the proposed house to be erected on the property (there being no reference to livestock structures in that email).   on 17 december 2018 the respondent had emailed the architects referring to discussions that had occurred with the respondent, the applicant and the respondent’s children in relation to the proposed house to be erected on the property (there being no reference to livestock structures in that email).
ms page: so you claim that the [shelters] and [livestock] amenities were only then added after we buy [livestock] transport? that’s why we were having a further meeting with [ms r]. yes or no? i don’t know when it was first raised. i don’t. his honour: next question. ms page: [mr gaubert], the architect quotation stated [livestock] amenities on 4 november 2017. you claim there was no [livestock] amenities included until after we bought a business. we didn’t buy the business until 2018 – october – one year later. please explain? well, as you know, we discussed a property. i bought the property. and a part of the property improvements were to build a shed. and the shed might as well make a facility for [livestock], being in an area like that. it would increase its rent value so that it could be rented out. and if i’m going to build a shed, i might as well build it so that it has got a facility for [livestock]. we were going out together. you had [livestock]. why would you build a [exercise area] and a round yard? because you liked [animals]. but you’re not in relationship with me. i’m only your girlfriend. a [exercise area] that would cost, like, $90,000. that was in the quotation for the architect. so was the round yard. so was a boutique barn. could you please explain that? so was the house, none of which i could afford, as you know. the question is why would you have an [exercise] area? because you were putting in plans to council so that i could build a shed for accommodation, which is all that i could afford. when did you start getting interested in [livestock], [mr gaubert]? i’m not particularly interested in [livestock]. then why would you have an [exercise area] on your property? it’s in a [livestock] area, and we were going out together. okay. enough.

legislation and legal principles
de facto relationships meaning of de facto relationship   a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if:   the persons are not legally married to each other, and (b) the persons are not related by family (see subsection (6)), and (c) having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.
paragraph (c) has effect subject to subsection (5). working out if persons have a relationship as a couple   those circumstances may include any or all of the following:   the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.   no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. (4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case.
"living together" and "breakdown" 28. section 4aa(1)(c) identifies the relationship which is the concern of the act: "a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis". the existence of such a relationship is determined having regard to "all the circumstances" of a relationship, significantly, those "circumstances" include any or all of the circumstances listed in s 4aa(2), and, by reason of s 4aa(3), no particular finding about any circumstance is necessary for there to be a de facto relationship. consistently with the reality that human relationships are infinitely mutable, in determining whether a de facto relationship exists a court is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate [23]. 29. a de facto relationship will have broken down when, having regard to all the circumstances, the parties no longer "have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis". such a conclusion is not precluded by the presence of an ongoing relationship of some sort. that is not the inquiry. the question is whether a de facto relationship exists or has broken down. 30. in the context of a human relationship, "breakdown" refers to the "end" or "breakup" of what had been an enduring emotional bond. it is the "breakdown" or "end" of a de facto relationship that is the trigger point for the federal circuit and family court to be seized of jurisdiction to make a property settlement order under s 90sm of the act. it would make no sense for such a jurisdiction to arise before a de facto relationship had ended. the appellant's submission finds no support in statutory context, in history, or in any extrinsic material referred to the court's attention. 31. other provisions in the act support the view that "breakdown" refers to the "end" of a de facto relationship... the need for cohabitation 32. the appellant's primary argument that the parties' de facto relationship had broken down when the appellant was placed into an aged care facility such that the parties were no longer physically living together must be rejected. it is contrary to the text of s 4aa and to statutory context and purpose to which reference has been made. it is also contrary to real-world considerations. it would be productive of injustice if two people who live apart (including for reasons of health) were incapable of remaining in a de facto relationship. 33. living together for the purposes of s 4aa(1) will often, perhaps usually, mean cohabitation of some residence by a couple for some period of time. but cohabitation of a residence or residences is not a necessary feature of "living together". that phrase must be construed to take account of the many various ways in which two people may share their lives together in the modern world [26]. two people, for any number of reasons, may not reside in the same residence, but nonetheless be in a de facto relationship in the sense required by s 4aa. 34. the fact that here the appellant was placed into an aged care facility may be relevant to the existence or breakdown of a de facto relationship under the act, but it could not, of itself, be determinative of that issue. the same observation applies to the decline in the appellant's cognitive ability. 35. two decisions support the proposition that physical cohabitation at a single home or homes is not a necessary feature of an ongoing relationship whether by way of marriage or otherwise, it is not an irreducible minimum that all relationships must exhibit... 39. the language of s 4aa of the act and its reference to "living together" requires no different approach to determining whether a relationship exists of the kind defined. "living together", consistently with authority, should be construed as meaning sharing life as a couple. section 4aa does not prescribe any way by which a couple may share life together. its language is sufficiently broad to accommodate the great variety of ways a de facto relationship may exist [41]. that conclusion is supported by the varied factors listed in s 4aa(2). in a given case, some of the factors listed in s 4aa(2) may be relevant and some may be irrelevant, inevitably some may have greater prominence than others. a conclusion that a de facto relationship has ended may also arise because of factors not listed in s 4aa(2). such a conclusion is mandated by s 4aa(3) and (4). in particular, s 4aa(4) is a statutory recognition that what may constitute a genuine de facto relationship is not be determined in the same way in every case by reference to rigid criteria that must always be satisfied. in that respect, the language of s 4aa(2)(b) does not assume that every de facto relationship must have a "common residence" to some "extent" and of some "nature". such a construction is entirely denied by s 4aa(3).
relevant circumstances under section 4aa(2) the duration of the relationship, the nature and extent of their common residence, whether a sexual relationship exists, the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them,  the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life,  the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.
other circumstances
applicant’s application for a declaration, in the alternative, that, being a party to a de facto relationship, she made substantial contributions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90 sm(4)(a), (b), or (c), and that a failure to make the declaration would result in serious injustice to her
a court may make an order under section 90se, 90sg or 90sm, or a declaration under section 90sl, in relation to a de facto relationship only if the court is satisfied:   that the period, or the total of the periods, of the de facto relationship is at least 2 years, or (b) that there is a child of the de facto relationship, or (c) that:   the party to the de facto relationship who applies for the order or declaration made substantial contributions of a kind mentioned in paragraph 90sm(4)(a), (b) or (c), and (ii) a failure to make the order or declaration would result in serious injustice to the applicant, or   that the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory.   in considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court must take into account:   the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship:   to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property, whether or not that last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, and   the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship:   to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property,
whether or not that last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, and (c) the contribution made by a party to the de facto relationship to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the de facto relationship and any children of the de facto relationship, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent.
17. what is meant by the term ‘substantial contributions’? the full court of the family court of australia in redmond & mullins[4] cited and affirmed the following view of holden cj in v & k :[5]
in my view, substantial means something more than usual or ordinary. in my view [the section] is aimed at more exceptional circumstances where serious injustice may be caused by the application of [the relevant provision].
18. johnston j addressed substantial contributions in wall & mitchell.[6] after referring to the decisions of miller & trent[7] and v & k he said:  3] with respect to both coates fm and holden cj, i agree. if usual or ordinary contributions were sufficient to amount to “substantial contributions” within the meaning of s 90sb(c) , there would be little purpose in the two years requirement in s 90sb(a) of the act. this is because in most de facto relationships to some extent usual or ordinary contributions would be a feature of such relationships.
19.the full court[8] decision in harriot & arena[9] is instructive in considering the meaning of “substantial contributions”:
59. if the appellant’s contribution of the net proceeds of her home constituted a “substantial” contribution, it will be unnecessary for us to determine the somewhat more vexed question of whether the actions taken by the appellant in relation to her career and her child should be characterised as “contributions”. 60. the trial judge made no finding as to whether the appellant’s contributions were “substantial”. however, he did record that the appellant relied on the decision of altobelli fm (as his honour then was) in webb & douglas [2012] fmcafam 1049 to support the assertion that “substantial” means “something more than usual or ordinary”, this being the view of holden cj in v and k [2005] fcwa 80 when dealing with equivalent legislation. (holden cj’s formulation has been followed in other cases, some of which were cited by watts j in lee v hutton [2013] famca 745, (2013) 50 fam lr 322 at [180]–[182]). 61. rather than agreeing with holden cj, it seems to us that altobelli fm disagreed with him, as appears from this extract from webb & douglas (original emphasis):
21. the cases therefore seem to suggest that before a contribution can be substantial, it must be more than usual or ordinary. this is a vague and subjective standard. in the diversity of relationships that present before courts exercising jurisdiction under the family law act how is “usual” or “ordinary” to be determined other than by reference to the facts of the case before the court at the time? how could a judicial officer make the comparisons that need to be made by using this standard without referring to extrinsic evidence ie. the judicial officer’s own perception of contribution in other cases? 22. by contrast it is interesting to note that fm coates in miller & trent referred to dictionary definitions of “substantial” at paragraph 59 of his judgment. he noted, for example, that the macquarie encyclopaedic dictionary defined substantial as “an ample or considerable amount as well as something having real worth or value”. his honour also referred to the concise oxford dictionary meaning of “having real importance or value and to a considerable amount”. federal magistrate coates also referred to a family provision act (1982) (nsw) decision in wentworth & wentworth (1995) 37 nswlr 703 where the court held that substantial “means not illusory, something considerable or large”. 23. whereas the v & k and miller & trent definition of substantial invite comparison to other cases, the dictionary definitions invite a more contextual analysis. in other words the question is whether the contribution is substantial in the context of the case being determined, and not by reference to other cases.
62. while altobelli fm erroneously assumed in webb & douglas that a court could have jurisdiction to deal with a de facto property dispute where it was common ground that neither s 90sk(1)(a) or s 90sk(1a) had been satisfied, his honour’s discussion draws attention to deficiencies in the “something more than usual or ordinary” formulation. noting that the matter was not the subject of proper argument, as presently advised we are not attracted to the “something more than usual or ordinary” definition, since it would, for example, seem to exclude parent and homemaker contributions in a lengthy marriage. this could not be right, as holden cj implicitly acknowledged at [20]–[21] in v and k. we would therefore be inclined to treat anything said in v and k as being confined to its own unusual facts, which involved two self-represented litigants, and where the issue was whether “substantial contributions” had been made in the 22 days the parties spent living in western australia. 63. to the best of our knowledge, the meaning of “substantial contributions” has not been the subject of careful consideration by this full court, although the matter was touched on in redmond & mullins [2015] famcafc 69, where v and k was cited. however, the meaning of “substantial” has been the subject of much discussion by other courts. our review of those authorities indicates support for these observations of deane j in tillmans butcheries pty ltd v the australasian meat industry employees’ union [1979] fca 85, (1979) 27 alr 367 at 382:
the word “substantial” is not only susceptible of ambiguity: it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision. in the phrase “substantial loss or damage”, it can, in an appropriate context, mean real or of substance as distinct from ephemeral or nominal. it can also mean large, weighty or big. it can be used in a relative sense or can indicate an absolute significance, quantity or size. the difficulties and uncertainties which the use of the word is liable to cause are well illustrated by the guidance given by viscount simon in palser v grinling ( ... [1948] ac 291 at 317) where, after holding that, in the context there under consideration, the meaning of the word was equivalent to “considerable, solid or big”, he said: “applying the word in this sense, it must be left to the discretion of the judge of fact to decide as best he can according to the circumstances of each case...
64. clearly the “substantial contributions” test is a subjective one. any effort to elucidate its meaning by use of other words or phrases will simply replace one subjective test with another. it will remain a matter of impression whether the contributions are considered to be “substantial”. while recognising that the test is subjective, we are nevertheless inclined to agree with thackray j, who said in thorburn and oswald [2007] fcwa 43 at [54] that a trial judge
would need to interpret the word “substantial” in the context of the financial position of the parties. what might appear to be a “substantial contribution” for people of limited financial resources, might not be substantial in a case involving very wealthy parties.
65. to like effect, see oakley and roche [2009] fcwa 132 at [15] per crisford j. 66. as noted, the trial judge made no finding as to whether the appellant’s submissions [sic] were “substantial”. we consider that the contribution of $80,000 from the sale of the appellant’s home was “substantial”, and we note that the respondent effectively conceded as much, since his counsel accepted that the application of those funds in vanuatu represented a “substantial” contribution. that being the case, it is unnecessary for us to come to a concluded view about the other “contributions” upon which the appellant relied.   the property at town q.
from at least about 12 january 2018, when the respondent purchased a tractor for the applicant’s use, the applicant spent “hours on end” and “well over 100 hours” of manual labour maintaining the property through clearing work, whipper snipping, weeding, regularly slashing paddocks, removing old ag pipe and wire fencing, and filling holes in the property. she organised for electric fences to be installed, planted and watered boundary trees, maintained the access road grass verges and entrance. she performed this maintenance work continually whilst she resided at the property. the property was very overgrown and derelict when the parties moved in to live at the property in december 2017. the applicant drove the tractor purchased by the respondent to carry out some of the above tasks.
the court observes, again, that the applicant lived at the property at least from about early december 2017 to june 2018 (when the parties rented premises together in suburb ax, queensland), and probably intermittently attended the property in the second half of 2018.  the business company ba.
