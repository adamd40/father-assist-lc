ex tempore reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction  requires a structured routine and stability alongside the continuation and development of her relationship with her father. supporting [ms laramie's] wellbeing at this time is also a primary consideration, as she is [x's] primary caregiver and is also managing the considerable needs of the three children, one of whom has special needs and requires significant resources both emotionally and physically to care for. [x] is highly reliant on a primary caregiver for her physical, emotional and development needs at this time.[6]
