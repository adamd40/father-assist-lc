the father’s case
reviews - relevant principles
basis upon which final orders were made
despite the application having now been before the court for five months, [the father] appears to have taken no steps either to engage legal counsel, or to comply with the court’s directions in any way. pursuant to section 69zn of the family law act 1975 (cth), i am required to proceed in parenting matters without undue delay. i am not satisfied of the explanation [the father] has given for his failure to comply with the court’s directions and i do not consider it to be in the children’s best interests to continue to be exposed to litigation in circumstances where [the father] continues to fail to comply with the court’s directions to facilitate his participation in the proceedings. for those reasons, i will grant leave to [the mother] to proceed on an undefended basis this day. it will be open to [the father] to apply to set aside orders made on that basis, in the event he can satisfy the court of the matters as prescribed in rule 1.34 of the rules.
evaluation
on 1 march 2022, we were listed before senior judicial registrar glass for an interim defended hearing. senior judicial registrar glass was extremely patient with [the father] and asked him repeatedly if he understood that the matter was proceeding on that day. [the father] confirmed that he did understand.
disposition and assessment
the termination of a worthwhile relationship between the parent and child ought in most cases be the course of last resort. the court should not shy away from reaching such a result in an appropriate case but at all times judges should be conscious that the adversarial or inquisitorial systems often reach results that are artificial. the truth does not always come out. a false negative finding accompanied by appropriate safeguards as to the future relationship between parent and child, such as adequate supervision to guard against possible abuse, may be far less disastrous for the child than an erroneous positive finding that leads to a cessation of the parent-child relationship. the court needs to be remain conscious of this imperfection at all times.
