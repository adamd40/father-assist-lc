legal principles
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).   identify the assets, liabilities and financial resources of the parties to the marriage, (b) identify and assess the relevant contributions of each of the parties within the meaning of s.79(4)(a), (b) and (c), (c) consider the matters in s.79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s.75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   identify and assess the relevant contributions of each of the parties within the meaning of s.79(4)(a), (b) and (c), (c) consider the matters in s.79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s.75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   consider the matters in s.79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), including the matters in s.75(2) so far as they are relevant, and determine whether any adjustment ought to be made to the contribution based entitlement of the parties assessed earlier, and (d) consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.   consider the effect of the above findings and decide whether it is just and equitable to make the order.

...once it has been established that there has been a deliberate non-disclosure... then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. to do otherwise might be thought to provide a charter for fraud in proceedings of this nature....the court’s jurisdiction to make an order going beyond the identified property arises once there is sufficient evidence to support a finding that the party has not made a full disclosure of his or her assets.
...where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value

assessment of the contributions of the parties
the essential task is to assess the nature form and extent of the contributions of all types made by each of the parties within the context of an analysis of their particular relationship
16. although it is natural to assess financial contributions under s.79(4)(a) by reference to individual assets, it is also natural to assess the contribution of a spouse as homemaker and parent either by reference to the whole of the parties' property or to some part of that property. for ease of comparison and calculation it will be convenient in assessing the overall contributions of the parties at some stage to place the two types of contribution on the same basis, i.e. on a global or, alternatively, on an "asset-by-asset" basis. which of the two approaches is the more convenient will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. however, there is much to be said for the view that in most cases the global approach is the more convenient. it follows that the full court is quite entitled to prescribe that approach as a guideline in order to promote uniformity of approach within the court. in saying this we are not to be understood as denying the legitimacy of the trial judge's ascertainment in the first instance of the financial contributions of the parties by reference to particular assets. it is difficult to conceive how the trial judge in many cases could otherwise take account of such contributions as he is required to by s.79(4)(a) of the act. in this respect we agree with the comment of nygh j. in g and g that, although mathematical precision is certainly not required, there is ordinarily a need to know the circumstances in which assets were acquired and the general extent of each party's contribution to them. 17. the assessment of the parties' entitlements before the making of an order is another question, quite distinct from the assessment of their contributions. as a matter of construction of s.79 nygh j. is right in saying that the section imposes no obligation on the family court to pursue in relation to this issue either the global approach or the asset-by-asset approach to the exclusion of the other. we do not understand the full court in the present case to suggest otherwise. what the full court asserts is that the global approach is the only "realistic", that is, convenient, means of arriving at the entitlements of the parties. again, it seems to us that it will depend on the circumstances of the particular case, though in the majority of cases the global approach will be the more convenient and for this reason the full court is entitled to prescribe its adoption as a guideline in the majority of cases. the family court has rightly criticized the practice of giving over-zealous attention to the ascertainment of the parties' contributions, and we take this opportunity of expressing our unqualified agreement with that criticism, noting at the same time that the ascertainment of the parties' financial contributions necessarily entails reference to particular assets in the manner already indicated.
in our opinion, in most cases, a damages verdict arising from a personal injury claim, whenever received, is a contribution by the party who suffered the injury. it should not be considered in isolation, for the reason that each and every contribution, which each of the parties makes to the relationship, must be weighed and considered at the same time
