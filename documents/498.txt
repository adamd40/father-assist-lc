...
14.07 procedure for review   a court must hear an application for review of an exercise of power by a senior judicial registrar or judicial registrar as an original hearing.
note: in an original hearing, the court rehears the whole matter and does not simply review the decision of the original court. (2) the court may receive as evidence: (a) any affidavit or exhibit tendered in the first hearing, or (b) any further affidavit or exhibit, or (c) the transcript (if any) of the first hearing, or   if a transcript is not available—an affidavit about the evidence that was adduced at the first hearing, sworn by a person who was present at the first hearing.
although on review, the court should consider the matter afresh, it does not follow that the reasoning of the registrar should be ignored, or that variations in the material presented to her, or him, and the evidence that was adduced are irrelevant. the starting point is, therefore, the decision that is to be reviewed. the court does not merely cast that decision to one side and proceed as if it had never been made. the court will have regard to the basis on which the decision was made and the material placed before the court itself on the application for review: wily re led (south coast) pty ltd [2009] nswsc 946 at [24] – [26].
the decision of the senior judicial registrar e father] refers to allegations of family violence that have resulted in the making of domestic violence orders. in particular, he refers to an incident in september of 2019 where he alleges that [the mother] threatened to hurt [the child] in utero and began to cut herself, and otherwise deposes to her exposing him to significant domestic violence, emotional manipulation to screaming and hitting and making other threats to harm. whilst [the mother] accepts that there have been incidents of yelling and screaming, she denies any physical violence. significantly those allegations predate consensual arrangements for [the child] to live with his mother and spend the time that i have outlined with his father. i infer that [the father] did not consider [the child] to have then been at unacceptable risk of harm in [the mother’s] care. [the father] raises concerns arising from his observations of [the child] during video conversations, and also a photograph that was sent to him showing injuries on [the child]. as a result of those concerns, a number of welfare checks were undertaken by new south wales police at [the father’s] request and no issues arose as a result of those inquiries. [the father] also refers to incidents of family violence that appear to have occurred between [the mother] and her now ex-partner in or around november of last year, which also resulted in domestic violence order proceedings between them, and it appears a charge of assault. nevertheless, despite that evidence [the father] proposes that [the child] spend at the very least one week per month unsupervised with his mother, or alternatively, in the event that [the mother] lives in the [city b] area, that, in fact, [the child] live primarily with her. i infer from his proposal that he does, in light of the more recent evidence, consider [the child] to be at unacceptable risk of harm in the relevant sense in his mother's care and i do not reach a different conclusion.

analysis
issue 1 - significance of the mother relocating prior to the final hearing
two of the principles underpinning part vii of the act [s 60b(2)] encourage parents to share duties and responsibilities for their children and to agree about future parenting arrangements for them. for reasons arising from these principles, amongst other factors, courts applying part vii are discouraging of parents, who take unilateral actions in respect of arrangements for their children, except in circumstances of significant emergency. this is particularly so in cases of relocation, which invariably have implications for both the quality and quantity of relationship the parent left behind can have with the children affected by the other parent’s move. the high court has indicated that cases involving relocation require delicate and careful analysis of all the pros and cons, in respect of the move, from the individual perspectives of all concerned, including the children. for the reasons outlined already, such a degree of analysis is not possible at the interim stage. in morgan & miles, which was a case which arose after the shared parental responsibility amendments were implemented, boland j confirmed that the court should be reticent to determine issues of relocation at the interim stage. she said as follows:
“it is highly desirable that, except in cases of emergency, the arrangements which will be in the child’s best interests should not be determined an abridged interim hearing, and these are the types of cases in which the child’s present stability may be extremely relevant on an interim basis. it further appears to me that the comments of warnick j in c and s remain apt and relevant to determination of these cases.”
the comments, of warnick j referred to, were as follows:
“in my view it is clear that the interests of any child or children, including the children here, are very much connected with any questions directly affecting those children, such as a re-location, being determined by a court without the impediment of a situation of recent development, which situation significantly alters the relationship of the child or circumstances of the child with regard to one of its parents, from what it or they had been immediately beforehand.”  tations omitted)
issue 2 - the prospects of the mother obtaining appropriate accommodation for herself and the child in city b
issue 3 – is it in the best interests of the child for orders to be made requiring the mother to return to city b and/or for orders to be made for the child to live with the father.
i seek that [the child] live primarily with me to provide greater stability and an environment and home life free of domestic violence.
i am still very concerned however about the stability of [the mother] and her domestically violent relationship with [[mr f]] that is contining [sic] in advo proceedings.
the mother’s parenting capacity
screened out for [the child] for risk of psychological harm with prf of mental health and domestic violence. although it is concerning that the mother is verbally abusing the father via text and phone calls and is threatening to start taking drugs or threatening the father to not be able to see [the child] unless the father does what she wants him to do. there is insufficient information that [the child] is exposed to these text messages and phone calls considering his age. the mother and father have no face-to-face contact currently. this report does not meet risk of significant harm at this stage (emphasis added)
screens out for risk of significant neglect as there is insufficient information to mark mental health as a parental risk factor. whilst there are some concerns that [the mother] may not be coping since giving birth to [the child] (4 weeks old), there is insufficient information to indicate that her mental health is interfering with her functioning, or significantly impacting on her care & supervision of [the child]. [the mother’s] statements raising concerns for her mental state were in a conversation with [the father] and it is not known if it is indicative of what is going on her in her daily life.  e mother] has a history of mental health issues. she has been scheduled to a psychiatric service under the mental health act in 2016 and 2015. the issues at the time were threatened self harm. [the mother] advised that she does not have a mental health diagnosis. [ms kane’s] father, [the maternal grandfather] advised that he sought psychiatric therapy for [the mother] when she was a teenager and that this seemed to help her. [the maternal grandfather] also advised that he does not have current concerns about [the mother’s] mental health and that her behaviour in september 2019 was a reaction to finding herself in a situation in which she is pregnant and [the father] does not want to continue the relationship. [the mother] also stated that she acknowledges that her behaviour in the incident in september was "over the top" and that she has since processed her feelings about her situation. [the mother] said that she understands that working out a co-parenting relationship with [the father] "will take time". she said she has good emotional support from her cousin, her dad and her mum.
risk due to the alleged potential for the child to be exposed to family violence in the care of the mother
i am concerned that [the mother] and [[mr f]] are still in a very toxic and unstable relationship that includes domestic violence which [the child] is being exposed to. because of the situation, myself and my mother have made a number of reports to the department of communities and justice about the care and welfare of both [the child] and [h]. i am unsure as to any action they have taken.
with information available to police, police see significant doubt as to the seriousness of the allegation. police believe an argument took place, [[mr f]] was pushed and away and out of the [mother’s] space as a self defence response. police believe cutlery was thrown towards the victim at the time he was leaving the house. [[mr f]] states he has no fears of the [mother] and of note the [mother] is of petite build, [[mr f]] is of solid build. the victim has since returned to the area of (redacted) to live. of the two alleged assaults that have taken place police see the hitting/pushing to be self defence and the throwing of the cutlery to be in anger and not with the intent to connect with [[mr f]]. police see it is not in the best interest of all parties to pursue a common assault charge for this matter. as such will not be taking any action.

other relevant matters:
it is often difficult to disentangle the interests of a parent from the interests of a child. indeed, “the reality that the nurture of children is inextricably intertwined with the well-being of the nurturing parent” is far from novel. a child’s welfare is often advanced in tandem with improvements in the parent’s financial, social, and emotional circumstances.
