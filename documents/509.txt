independent children’s lawyer’s orders sought
oral evidence of the father
i suspect collusion between her [the icl] and [ms f], the mother’s lawyer. i have suspicions that [the icl] and [ms f] are in a romantic relationship, and this is true. there will [be] present a conflict of interest. ... during the court hearing on 13 may, i observed that the icl was looking at the mother’s lawyer, [ms f], in an adoring way, that i have suspicion their relationship goes beyond professional.
and this has already been touched on by mr haddock earlier, but wouldn’t it follow from that that if an independent assessor, the psychologist – the family consultant – assesses the girls to be really well, that that would almost inevitably follow that the decisions that the mother has made for their care and welfare generally has been really good?‑‑‑that is a really dangerous position to even think about it because people are murdered every day. i’m sure, as a judge, you have actually witnessed people being – who – murderers or – probably, you’ve handled with that were – that’s previously – these things could be said about them. but there were also incidents of foul play, setting risk factors, having broken lights. there is no probability – there’s no correlation between a child’s current performance and the risk factors that surround that child. that says that based on this, those risk factors are eliminated. they are not. those risk factors are extreme. they are significant and a child who is a minor who does not rights of her own – i believe, that if a child was assaulted, she – or if an adult was assaulted, the adult can take a decision as to whether to involve the police or not, but a child needs the mother to do that and when in all these situations, the child is not protected then it’s a significant risk that the courts should look at. it has no correlation whatsoever to school performance or anything that we’re talking about. and what responsibility did you have or did you show by going to [country b] for five years and leaving the children with their mother?‑‑‑in the family report of 2020, if the – can i check the paragraph? well, i would be grateful if you could just tell me what you could remember and then if we need to, we can check it?‑‑‑yes. in the family reports of 2020, [ms yulay] did mention to the family consultant then that they’re at a point where – i forgot the technical term, but when i got – [x] was a – sorry, [y] was a baby then – at a point where [y] was a baby, the exchange process where she will bring her to me was a difficult process and it wasn’t in the interests of [y], and my action as a father at that time was to decide that it was not in the interests of [y] for even that exchange to happen. so she was with the mother. the other aspect of what i have done was that i personally believe that being alive and being well, being in that good mental state was in the interests of the children better than me being in the position where i, myself, wasn’t okay. it was a risk factor if i wasn’t in the right frame of mind to look after the children. so it was in the best interests of the children at that time. if i am not in a good frame of mind to be a good father, i would not put my children in that risk. so what i did, in 2014, was to go get help for myself so that the children would not be negatively impacted. so would it be fair to summarise it then that your decision to be absent from the children’s lives for five years was in their best interests because you were attending to your mental health, emotions, etcetera?‑‑‑yes. it was in their best interests in that – still within that time, we’re still fighting. there was a lot of – the dvo, for example. i was accused of assault. there were every opportunity was being sought to get me. exposure, interactions between [people of colour] and police: it’s not good, and but every opportunity was being sought to get me involved in the police one way or the other. i felt that it was in the best interests of the children to cut off that link.
oral evidence of the mother
yes? okay. thank you. i don’t have any issue with that. my only issue is my relationship with him and the impact it has on the children. yes. so if it’s going to impact – looking at all that is going on, yes. if it’s going to have an impact on the children in a negative sense, yes, i think i have – that’s where i have the – my concern. if he’s going to brainwash the kids and if he’s given the opportunity .... all right. and, so, if all of those things were in place, [y] would be safe, not able to be brainwashed by her father, and if she were distressed it could be stopped. what’s the problem with trying that if there’s a possibility of a positive relationship like [mr zahir] had with [x] before he left for [country b]? my worry – main worry is, yes, if he is under supervision it’s meant to be a different thing, and if he’s left alone it’s going to be a different thing...

[ms yulay] stated that she, and the children, were well protected, by family, and friends, until they left [country b], to return to australia, therefore, there was no necessity to report the incident to the police, either in [country b], or in australia, where the family was safe. according to [mr zahir], there is no evidence to support the allegation (which he denies), made by [ms yulay], that he sexually assaulted [x]. there are no reports of violence, perpetrated, by [mr zahir], towards the children. 134. at the family assessment, [mr zahir] described his marriage to [ms yulay], as “false”, stating that he did not actively participate in the wedding ceremony, however, at times, during the marriage, when he suggested a separation, [ms yulay] fell pregnant, with each of their two children. mr [zahir] commented that [ms yulay]’s falling pregnant with [mr yulay]’s child could have been a strategy to ensure the approval of [mr yulay]’s spouse visa, to re-locate, to australia.

[mr zahir] reports that he returned to australia, in order to protect his children from “psychological damage”, after receiving on-going reports, about [ms yulay]’s abusive relationship, with [mr yulay].

[mr zahir] remains in close contact with family members, who live in [country b]. he reports having a close circle of friends, and involvement with his local church. 138. [ms yulay] described [mr zahir], as “abusive, and controlling”, during their relationship, and post-separation, reporting that [mr zahir]’s abusive behaviour escalated when he was asked to pay child support, for the children. she reported physical, verbal, and sexual abuse, during the marriage, and further abuse, in the form of defamatory emails about her, sent by [mr zahir], to family members (including [x]), friends, and [country b] community members. [ms yulay] stated, at the family assessment that she feels “terrified”, and “not at peace”, knowing that [mr zahir] has returned to live in australia. she expressed fears for the safety of her children, and has had a security camera installed at the front of her house, the data being accessible by [mr yulay] (in the [country c]), as an extra safety precaution. 139. [ms yulay] expresses great concern that [mr zahir] wishes to spend time with the children, due to his history of violence, and particularly, the sexual assault of [x]. she expressed her wish that the children have no contact with [mr zahir]. 140. [ms yulay], and the children, live in [town m], act. [ms yulay] is a [health care worker], who has worked at the ‘[employer p]’, [suburb q], act, for approximately nine years. she reports having a close friendship group, who provide assistance (for example, with school pickups), if required. [ms yulay] reports having a good relationship, with extended family members, who live in [country b], and in other parts of the world. 141. [ms yulay] married [mr yulay], in 2013. they have a daughter, ‘[d]’, who is three years old. [mr yulay] lives in the [country c], after being deported from australia, after his visa expired. [ms yulay]described [mr yulay] as “my friend”. she denied family violence, in the relationship. [ms yulay] reports that the children have a strong relationship with [mr yulay], and his son, ‘[n]’, speaking, via ‘skype’ on most days. prior to the covid-19 pandemic, [ms yulay], and the children, would visit [mr yulay], in the [country c], once, or twice, each year. [mr yulay] plans to re-locate, to live in australia, once he has “spouse” visa approval. 142. at the time of the family assessment, each of the children is, reportedly, doing well at school. the children have friends, and present as well cared for. the children appear to be happy, in their present living arrangements. each child expressed a wish not to have contact with [mr zahir], with [x] referring to historical events. y has not had the opportunity to develop a relationship, with [mr zahir]. the impact of the alleged sexual assault of [x], on [y] (who was present at the event), was not mentioned, during the family assessment. 143. communication between the parents is non-existent. each parent reports concerns about “lies” told by the other parent that support their own case. there is no trust between the parents, evidenced by their allegations, particularly those of family violence, against each other, although evidence of an incident of family violence, against [ms yulay], by [mr yulay], has been provided, in the documents. [mr zahir] claims to have evidence that the alleged sexual assault, of [x], did not occur. such evidence would enhance his proposal to be re-introduced to, and develop a relationship, with each of the children. without concrete evidence (for example, police reports) to support the allegations of each of the parents, about the other parent, it is not possible to ascertain the level of truthfulness, or embellishment/exaggeration of incidents that have, reportedly, occurred in the past. 144. [ms yulay] has been the primary carer for the children, since approximately 2011. there has been no contact, between [mr zahir], and the children, since 2015, other than at the funeral of the maternal grandfather, in late-2017. re-introduction of the children, if ordered, to [mr zahir] will need to be conducted over an extended period of time, under supervision, with frequent reviews, on the impact of the re-introduction, on each of the children. the opportunity for the children to spend time with [mr zahir] could enhance future decisions, made by the children, whether, or not, to continue to have a relationship, with [mr zahir]. recommendations 145. based on the family assessment, and review of documentation related to the matter, available at the time of the family assessment, it is respectfully suggested that, a) [ms yulay] has sole parental responsibility for the children, b) the children live with [ms yulay], contact between [mr zahir], and the children, if ordered, by the court, is introduced in very short sessions (approximately thirty minutes), initially, and under the supervision of an external agent/organization (such as [e contact service], act), with frequent review, and feedback, on the impact of the re-introduction, of the children, to [mr zahir], d) the children are provided with supportive therapy, to increase their feelings of confidence, and safety, if there is contact, with [mr zahir], e) neither parent is permitted to make derogatory comments, about the other parent, or the other parent’s partner, to, or in the presence, of the children, f) the children’s names remain on the airport “watch list”, until they attain an age of eighteen years, unless otherwise ordered by the court. g) [ms yulay] is offered the opportunity to attend therapy/counselling to address her anxiety, related to the re-introduction of the children, to [mr zahir],
d) the children are provided with supportive therapy, to increase their feelings of confidence, and safety, if there is contact, with [mr zahir], e) neither parent is permitted to make derogatory comments, about the other parent, or the other parent’s partner, to, or in the presence, of the children, f) the children’s names remain on the airport “watch list”, until they attain an age of eighteen years, unless otherwise ordered by the court. g) [ms yulay] is offered the opportunity to attend therapy/counselling to address her anxiety, related to the re-introduction of the children, to [mr zahir],

g) [ms yulay] is offered the opportunity to attend therapy/counselling to address her anxiety, related to the re-introduction of the children, to [mr zahir],
oral evidence of the family consultant  g], am i right from your report that, in your interactions with [mr zahir], he seemed to have a focus on criticising the mother of the children, have i got that right? [mr zahir] was very much focused on protecting the children. the protection was, for the children, mainly with the husband of – of the mother and his fears that the children would be subjected to violence – not at his hands, but would witness violence in that relationship between the mother and the stepfather. but his view of the mother didn’t appear to be very positive in terms of her ability to be protective from violence, you would agree with that, wouldn’t you? i would agree with that, yes. okay. right. and he seemed to have a pretty negative opinion of the mother generally, is that fair to say? generally speaking, yes. yes. and that seemed to be a pretty firmly-held belief by him? yes, and it seems to have stretched across a number of years and incidents – or reported incidents, yes. almost an entrenched opinion, if i could put it that way, would that be fair? yes, yes.
yes. and that’s particularly because of two things, as i understand it, that come out of your report. one is that mum has got that psychological primary carer role for [y], but also because of the circumstances of this case which mean that the father is a stranger to this particular child? yes. okay. and are you able to say – is it really the case that i take from the report that any relationship that the father might develop with [y] is only going to be a meaningful relationship if it has got the support of the mother? that – that would be fair to say, yes. they all need to work together, to some extent – or to an extent, yes. ... yes. and the way that time between the children – the idea of time between the children and the father and the fear associated with that impacts on the mother has a necessary flow-on effect to the children, correct? i would say so, particularly the younger child. and that’s right, because [y] is perhaps of a younger age and is more vulnerable and is more reliant on mum. it has an exponential impact, is that correct? yes, correct. just pardon me one moment, sorry. and, sorry, the other element of that in terms of what we think is the support for the idea of time in a relationship, if we focus on [y] for a moment, it seems that [x] is quite anxious about the idea of [y] spending time with the father to the extent that she’s saying, “look, i would go along, because otherwise i would be uncomfortable.” i’ve got that right? yes, correct. okay. and so the concept of time between the father and [y] wouldn’t necessarily just have a psychological impact on the mother. it seems that it would also have one on [x], have i got that right? that – yes. yes. yes. and that psychological impact would be, at least for a period, in a form of worry and anxiety, correct? that would be the case, yes. and she seems – [x], i have to say, from your report, seems like quite an articulate, intelligent young lady, i’ve got that right? that’s how she presented. and it seems if she had put quite a lot of thought into this idea and what her worry would be, have i got that right? that impression from your report? yes, yes.
okay, lovely. so you spoke there about what would be needed for reintroduction if it was ordered, and you said that it would need to be conducted over an extended period of time. i’m just interested in understanding, when you use the phrase “extended period of time,” what sort of timeframe are we talking about? are we talking about a year? more? less? i would say at least a year, and i do recall putting in the recommendations that it needed to be in very, very short periods of time with very specific reviews to ensure that [y] in particular was not becoming too distressed and/or had the appropriate supports in place to help her manage that re-introduction.
say there are three sessions and there are levels of distress with [y], for whatever reason. subject to what the reason is for the distress and the critique of the visits done independently, obviously, by the contact centre, would three visits, for example, be more than sufficient to give someone like your good self sufficient information to say it’s worthwhile pursuing or better just to pull up stumps and abandon it? if – if the sessions were a month apart, i don’t believe that three would be enough. i – my suggestion would be that the sessions, if they were to be held, were closer together, so that there was so, what, a fortnight? yes. yes, your honour. in that way, there – there is going to be a more timely, i think, monitoring of the progression of – of the – well, for [y]. okay? yes. well, say they’re every fortnight. after a month and a half – or, say, after two months, is that going to be sufficient time to make a fair assessment that they’re worth continuing or better to pull the plug because of the distress? i would – yes, your honour. i would think that that would be a good timeframe. ... okay. all right. and i guess the other side to that lens in terms of what [y] will miss out on, i’ve taken from what you’ve said, is there’s some potential downsides in terms of mum’s anxiety and [x]’s anxiety, and that those potential downsides must be balanced against how the mother can, if she can, encourage the time and the relationship. i’ve understood that correctly? that – that’s correct. okay. and so, ultimately, are you able to identify what, if anything, are the benefits to [y] of having a relationship with the father or time with the father, i should say, as things stand right now? the benefit, i believe, would be that [y] would have the opportunity to develop or not a relationship with – with the father. she knows nothing about the father, or very little. what she seems to know is not positive. so if that opportunity was presented to her with appropriate support, then she would be in a better position to make a decision about whether – there would be outside input in terms of people reviewing her psychological wellbeing during that process, but there would also be the opportunity for her to be able to say, “well, even if i don’t spend a lot of time with this person, there is something that i might be able to gain from having a relationship with this person, as opposed to not having a relationship, or the opportunity to attempt to have a relationship with him at all.” so, looking at that, something she might be able to gain: what are the things that she might be able to gain from that relationship, as you’ve said? the other things? the support of the father in, say, her education or extracurricular activities. that – that – that would be one area where that could be supportive. there’s the influence or the impact of cultural background and learning more about the cultural background from a different perspective. same cultural background, but different perspective, and how that would pan out. so i think those – those two are – are positives that could be gained.
right. and then the role of the electronic side of things? the electronic side of things, i really – i feel that it would need to go hand in hand with face-to-face contact. that, by itself, that might not be a positive – or it – it won’t allow the contact to demonstrate the body language as much, as we know by the work that we’ve been doing. so the face-to-face contact is – is very important, complemented by follow-up video calls – not phone calls, video calls – so that is reinforced with the child. that could be i see? useful, as well. thank you. mr haddock: and just thinking about the commencement of time, the question i had for you was this. if we’re looking at a situation where this man is a stranger to [y] – and focusing on [y] – and we’re looking at starting time and then potentially stopping it, what’s the advantage to [y] of having to start time with the potential of stopping it as opposed to not starting time with the father? what’s the benefit, did you say, sorry? yes. what is the advantage to her of starting and potentially stopping as opposed to not starting? the – the advantage to her would be still the opportunity to actually meet this person and form an opinion and/or develop a relationship with that person. so my suggestion would be that it’s not only supervision, but also – of supervised visits or contact, if that was to happen, but also separate support for her where she could talk through what had happened, how she felt about it, and then, supported by that particular individual, basically work her way through how she was feeling, how she was responding, or whatever, to – to draw some conclusions for herself.
and so, consequently, one of the outcomes of that exploration could be, couldn’t it, that [y] says no. “i’ve explore it, and the answer is no”? the – the therapy would need to be designed and developed around encouraging the child. so on a – on a costs and benefits or a pros and cons with the – the therapist introducing the – the potential for a positive outcome in the context of this safe environment that the child would be in, and also allowing the child to know or at least have some information that, if it wasn’t a comfortable experience for her over time – so not immediately, because young children will often jump on the immediate – over time, then it could be discontinued, and i would suggest that the importance of the individual therapist is to help the child work through that – that particular process. the supervision is basically about the parent and the child interacting with each other without the supervisor...
and that that is an informed choice? that’s an informed choice, but i – also based on the fact that this child is still only very young. so there would need to be support from other members of the family around trying this particular approach. and would it be the case that you would recommend this same process for [x] and [y], or only [y]? [x] presented as much more independent. she is very articulate. she did mention and it’s in the report – i can’t tell you exactly where – that, at some stage, she would probably wish to meet again with the father, if only to have closure and/or the opportunity to – to develop a relationship with the father. yes. so what she said at paragraph 94 was – she stated that, in the future, she might consider some interaction to get closure, then no further contact? that’s what she said, yes. ... but it was about getting closure on the relationship to be able to move on without the relationship? that’s the way that she – she presented it, yes. and so, at 16, you’re comfortable with that decision, but, for [y], at nine, you’re saying she can’t make that choice? not without the – the opportunity to spend some time with the father, if that is possible, and/or without – well, with supportive counselling, as well, to help her work through that process. ... so doesn’t that place [y] sort of between that proverbial rock and a hard place? it – it does, your honour. however, [x] has expressed that, although she’s very concerned she would be willing to accompany [y] to a meeting with the father. so, to me, that suggests she’s not totally against the idea herself, that – that – she – she has obviously thought about it and would consider that, if she felt sufficiently anxious about it, that she could accompany her to ensure her safety, if nothing else. ... seems a range of contradictions. i understand that that’s what we deal with, but still? it does. it – it – it does. i – to me, it suggested that [x] was not necessarily as reluctant to meet with the father as she might have presented, in other words, around closure, that there, in her mind, could still be the opportunity to have a more positive contact than just meeting with the father to get closure for herself. but it is all still predicated upon her anxiety for her sister about spending time with her father? that’s correct, your honour, yes. ...
she stated that [y] was shocked when she was informed that [mr yulay] was not her biological father. [x] stated her impression that [y] would not be safe to spend time with [mr zahir]. she stated that she would accompany [y] to any meetings, stating, “i wouldn’t feel comfortable.”
? that’s correct. now, i have interpreted that as she would put her own wishes secondary to [y]’s protection, have i misinterpreted that? no, you haven’t. that – that was the impression that she gave. all right. now, your report discovered that [y] was most closely bonded within her family to [x], that’s right, isn’t it? yes. that’s what she said. ... right. so we’re talking about a fairly close-knit little family? absolutely. ... his honour: so would it be going too far to say that the opportunity to explore the father-daughter relationship takes precedence over all else? i believe so, your honour. i believe that opportunity would be useful for the – for the child so that she can explore it, form her own opinions at nine and a half? nine and a half. it would be difficult. that’s one of the reasons i suggested a prolonged period of time, because, as a child that age, she is going to be influenced very much by the primary caregiver, the sister, because that’s her go-to person, and even the stepfather, because he seems to have very frequent input into the – into the family, as well.
his honour: well, on that score, the five-year absence: what’s the significance of that, where someone literally, for want of a better description, vanishes from the family to the other side of the world? what’s the significance of that, particularly from the perspective of the children? well, the – the – the children, your honour, the – the second child was a baby at – at the time. so it didn’t have – she, i beg your pardon – didn’t have a father figure at all. [x], on the other hand, had some knowledge of the father that – that vanished. so she would only have been – i can’t remember how old she was at the time, but she was only fairly young herself. so i – my – my impression is that – that they then moved onto this new relationship. so the father has been this person who has been not there at all. but the relationship with a father figure has developed with the stepfather over time. ... so he was still mia, so to speak? yes, absolutely. absolutely, and that would lead to questions, particularly with [x], as to where he was and why he was absent, because she did have some knowledge of him prior to his leaving the country. and does that have any significance – that is, his absence. does that have any significance – and, if so, what – in the attempt to re-establish a relationship with [y]? you know, will she ask, “well, you weren’t around. why?” “i was back in [country b] doing stuff”? working, yes. yes. so the impact on her – i – again, i – i feel that if any consideration to the father spending time with – well, [y] in particular, it is around this building of a relationship that was not able to happen at the time because – not because the father left the country, but more around circumstances that led to him leaving the country and not having contact, without going into too much detail. but you would accept, would you not, that going to another country is not – for, you know, five years is not a usual response to – you know, in sort of most family law matters. i know that there are particular circumstances here, and that [country b] is the cultural and family heritage – all those sorts of things. but just sort of fleeing, you know? it – it is unclear – or for me it was unclear as to why the father hadn’t returned previously. the information that he provided was that his preferred country of residence is [country b], so he would have stayed there had he not had information around the family violence that was reportedly or allegedly occurring in this new relationship with the – the – the mother – between the mother and the stepfather.
supplementary evidence of the family consultant
q) would it be in the child’s [[y]’s] best interests for therapy/counselling to commence when she is somewhat older, perhaps when she is 12, to enable her to better cope with the stresses and strains of what was recommended by [ms g]? 18 march 2022 matter of [zahir ]and [yulay] (cac833/2018) good afternoon your honour, thank you for the opportunity to address your question related to the "introduction of supportive therapy/counselling for the child, '[y]' (born [2012]) with a view of possibly commencing a relationship with the father" . it has been identified, to [y], that [mr yulay] is not her biological father. mr [zahir], her biological father, of whom she has little, or no recollection, has returned to australia, and wishes to establish a relationship, with her. it was suggested (family report, dated 21/02/22) [y] be afforded the opportunity to develop a relationship, with mr [zahir], over time, utilizing virtual communication, prior to face-to-face supervised contact (in short sessions), and then, depending on the outcome (which should be reviewed frequently), increased levels of contact, or not. supportive counselling is imperative, for each person, involved in the matter, and should commence, for [y], prior to her having any form of contact, with [mr zahir]. even though [y] is young (nine years of age), it is suggested that the longer the situation remains unattended, the greater the potential for a negative emotional/psychological impact for [y], in terms of confusion about her parentage, and the on-going stability, and security of her relationship, with [mr yulay], that has, to date, been described in positive terms. there is no suggestion that [mr zahir] attempt to take the "father" role, rather that [y] is able, over time, to understand the dynamics of the family interrelationships, and make informed decisions about her continuing to have a relationship with [mr zahir], in the future. i hope this provides an answer to your hounour' s question. yours truly, [ms p] (regulation 7, family consultant)
primary written submissions on behalf of the applicant
outline these submissions are provided in accordance with the orders of judge neville made on 4 march 2022. it is noted that the applicant father will be separately filing submissions regarding the watch list order issue. that issue will not be addressed in these submissions. the primary focus in this case has been about whether or not the child [y] should be introduced to her father, with safeguards in place, including counselling/therapy for her prior to any introduction and professional supervision for any future introduction. the evidence of [ms g] (including her letter dated 18 march 2022) supports the proposition that there are potential long-term negative emotional/psychological impacts for [y] if she is not afforded the opportunity to, safely, be introduced to her father. the father’s application is for family therapy and the introduction of modest time, fully supervised professionally, with this time simply to be reviewed. the letter from [ms g] dated 18 march 2022 should be admitted into evidence. it is noted that this letter was provided in response to a question raised by the court. 5. the following matters will be addressed: a. a brief background of the case, an assessment of the evidence supporting a reintroduction of time for [y], c. the section 68b injunction sought by the mother, d. consideration of the other relevant section 60cc factors, and e. summary. brief background of case the parties commenced cohabitation in about late 2004 or early 2005. they have 2 children, namely:- [x] born [in] 2005, currently aged 16 ½ years, and [y] born [in] 2012, currently aged 9 ½ years. the parties separated in about may 2012. between that date and about march 2014, the father spent regular time with [x] and some time with the then infant [y]. at about this time the father relocated to [country b] and lived there until october 2019. between the date of his departure and early 2015 the children had some video calls with the father. when the father returned to australia in october 2019 he attempted to engage with the mother in mediation to discuss possible resumption of his relationship with both children. the mother would not participate and the father filed his application on 26 february 2020. when he was self-representing the father sought a slow start but rapid progression to his time with the children. in the minute of orders filed on his behalf just prior to the commencement of the trial he made a much more modest proposal for therapy and then supervised time, followed by a review. in light of the recommendations of [ms g], including in her evidence, the father no longer seeks family therapy but accepts, instead, that both he and [y] should have separate counselling/therapy prior to any supervised time occurring. in relation to [x], it was common ground between the parties that there would be no orders compelling her to spend time with the father. both parties also agreed that there should be an order that permitted [x] to spend time with the father if she wishes to. whilst this order was technically not part of the father’s minute of orders, he seeks an order to this effect given the agreement of both of the parties. it should be noted that there is no transcript available. as a result, any reference to the evidence of any person is a reference to the notes taken at the time and may not be in precisely the same words as the relevant witness. should [y] be introduced to her father? the father accepts that he does not have a relationship with [y] and that she has no real memory of him. given that she was only about 18 months old when he left to live in [country b], this is perhaps not surprising. [y] believed, until recently, that the mother’s husband [mr yulay] was her father. anything she knows about the father has come from either her mother or her sister. the father maintains that he had a close and loving relationship with [x] prior to his departure for [country b]. the mother agreed during her evidence that, in that period, they had a positive relationship and that [x] was happy and comfortable in her father’s care. with an exception discussed in the following paragraph, the mother accepted that it would be a positive thing for [y] if she were able to develop the happy and comfortable relationship with her father similar to that which [x] had in the period prior to the father’s departure to [country b]. in answering the question referred to in the above paragraph, the mother did express concern about the possibility that the father would attempt to “brainwash” the children. this was explored with the mother in further cross examination. noting that the father does not seek any specific orders about any possible future time with [y] other than supervised by a professional supervision agency (with a review after a period of time), the mother accepted that in those circumstances:- a. [y] would be safe with her father, there would be no possibility for the father to attempt to “brainwash” [y], if the supervisor is to prepare reports about [y]’s time with her father, then everyone would be in a position to review how she was coping with that time. [ms g]’s very clear evidence was to the effect that it was important for [y]’s long-term psychological health that she have the opportunity to meet her father so that she can know who he is and form her own opinion about him and whether she would like to continue in a relationship with him. this position was emphasised in her letter dated 18 march 2022. in that letter she said, in answer to a question about whether or not any therapy or time could be delayed until [y] was older, “that the longer the situation remains unattended, the greater the potential for a negative emotional/psychological impact for [y] (sic) in terms of confusion about her parentage, and the on-going stability, and security of her relationship, with [mr yulay], that has, to date, described in positive terms.” [ms g] was also clear in her evidence that both [y] and the father should have counselling/therapy separately and before any possibility of supervised time is to occur. while the father had proposed family therapy in his minute of orders, he accepts the recommendations of [ms g] that therapy for he and [y] should be separate. the father also accepts that if there is to be an introduction to him and some time between he and [y], then it should not commence until after a reasonable period so that the counselling will have time to progress. the mother’s concern about the father potentially attempting to “brainwash” the children or, relevantly, [y] will not be able to occur on the basis of the orders sought by the father. in the first instance only counselling will be occurring which, in accordance with the recommendations of [ms g], will be separate and distinct from counselling that he will undertake. he then only seeks orders for professionally supervised time. it can be accepted, as it was by the mother, that professional supervisors will intervene if the father were to say or do anything inappropriate during a session. if that were to occur, the mother would be notified as a result of any reports being prepared. the only progression the father then seeks is for the parties to engage in mediation to review the progress of those arrangements. the court would have been impressed by the father’s expressed willingness to abide by recommendations of counsellors and therapists and also that he would be unlikely to insist on time if [y] were distressed. in any event, a professional supervision agency would be unlikely to facilitate time if she were distressed. the mother will probably be referring to the father’s communications with various people, including her, in the period up to about 2017. more recently, the father has sent entirely inappropriate correspondence to the court making unfounded and improper allegations. it seems to be the case that the father has difficulty in keeping his written communications respectful and contained. the manner in which he gave evidence, however, showed a calm and measured man who seemed to answer questions thoughtfully. even though he then repeated his unfounded and improper allegations from his recent correspondence with the court, he still did so calmly and without apparent anger. it is accepted that the father has firm and fixed views about the mother and her husband. no orders that he seeks in these proceedings will put him in a position to share those views with [y]. it is to be hoped that the counselling that he accepts should occur for himself will assist him in understanding the importance of not sharing those views, if they are then maintained by him, with [y]. the father expressed regret in hindsight that he had sent the emails to the mother and to members of her family and others up to 2017. he indicated that they had fought and that he was angry and that, as a result, he regretted that he had sent those emails. the court can take comfort from the fact that in the time since he has returned to australia he has not attempted to contact or harass the mother or the children. this is discussed in the next section in more detail. section 68b injunction sought by the mother in her amended response filed on 10 november 2021 the mother seeks an injunction pursuant to section 68b in the following terms:- “that an injunction pursuant to section 68b of the family law act 1975 issue restraining the applicant father from contacting, attempting to contact, locating or attempting to locate or otherwise approaching the mother or any of the children.” the mother attempted to obtain a family violence order in the act magistrates court upon learning of the father’s return to australia. that application was rejected on the basis, says the mother, that the father had not contacted her, at the time of the application, since 2017. the mother was carefully taken through the father’s behaviour since his return to australia in october 2019. that is now a period of approximately 2 ½ years. other than through lawyers for the purpose of these proceedings, there has been no communication between the parties and they have not come into contact with each other in any other way. only on one occasion in that time, at a store, have the parties come across each other. on that occasion there was no interaction between the parties including there being nothing said and no staring or other inappropriate behaviour. the parties lived in the same suburb until relatively recently. notwithstanding this fact, the mother accepted that the father has not contacted her, attempted to contact her, approached her or attempted to approach her. he has also not located or attempted to locate her. the mother also accepted that the father had not contacted or approached or attempted to contact to approach either of the children since his return to australia. effectively then, in the almost 2 ½ years since his return to australia, the father has not done any of the things that the mother seeks an injunction to restrain him from doing. having not obtained her fvo, on the basis of there being no contact between the parties for about 3 years prior to that application, the mother now seeks orders from this court when the period of there being no contact between them is now increased to between 5 and 5 ½ years. the order is also sought in circumstances where, without any order preventing him from doing so, he has not attempted to do any of the things that would be restrained by the mother’s proposed injunction. the evidence does not support the granting of the injunction sought by the mother. section 60cc factors section 60cc(2)(a) - benefit of meaningful relationship. [y] does not have any relationship with her father at present. there is some evidence that she would benefit from the opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with him. this evidence comes from both [ms g] and the mother. the mother accepted that, if her concerns were able to be addressed, it would be a positive thing if [y] were able to develop the type of relationship that [x] had with her father prior to his departure from australia. section 60cc(2)(b) – risks. it is accepted that the court would have some concerns about the possibility of the father sharing with [y] his unfavourable views of the mother and her husband. that risk is ameliorated, and probably eliminated, in circumstances where the father seeks no orders for any time at the moment other than supervised time. section 60cc(3)(a) – views. [y] does not know the father. anything that she does know about the father only comes from the mother or [x]. in what appears to be a throwaway line, [y] is recorded as saying that “she has no desire to see him”. this expression of her views is not surprising given her lack of relationship with him. given the probable long-term implications, less weight should be given to expressed views. section 60cc(3)(b) - nature of relationship. [y] has a loving and close relationship with mother, stepfather and her sister. she has no present relationship with the father. section 60cc(3)(c) & (ca) - extent of involvement. it is accepted that the father has failed to take the opportunity to spend time with the children or to completely fulfil his obligations of financial support. he did provide some financial support for the children. it is as a result of the father’s absence from the children’s lives that the current issues before the court are so difficult. section 60cc(3)(d) - likely effect of any change in circumstances. it is accepted that it is likely that an introduction would, in the first instance, be difficult for [y]. it is for that reason that [ms g] recommended, and the father accepts, that she should participate in counselling for a reasonable period prior to any introduction and subsequent time occurring. section 60cc(3)(j) - family violence. the mother makes a number of serious allegations regarding the father about alleged family violence. it is noted that neither of the parties were cross-examined about these issues. it is understood that no party seeks a finding regarding the allegations of family violence. section 60cc(3)(l) - preference to make orders to finalise proceedings. unfortunately, in the circumstances of this case, the court may be limited in being able to make orders that would prevent further proceedings. any orders that are made for therapy and/or supervised time would need to be reviewed after a period of time. this may include the possibility of further proceedings if the parties cannot agree on any progression. summary it is submitted that it is in the best interests of [y] that she be given the opportunity to be introduced to her father. it is accepted that that process would need to be dealt with sensitiviely to try and minimise any immediate adverse impact on her. the benefit to her of being given this opportunity is, in accordance with the recommendations of [ms g], to reduce the potential for long-term negative impacts on her psychological well-being. in addition, there is the possibility or hope, as conceded by the mother, that [y] may be able to develop a comfortable, relaxed and happy relationship with the father similar to that which [x] enjoyed with him prior to the father’s departure from australia. the mother has not established any basis on the evidence that injunctions should be granted in her favour to protect herself and the children. the court can, however, make orders in terms of paragraph 8 of the father’s proposed orders (with an amendment so as to refer to the correct section of the act). it is not understood that there was any objection to that order.
father’s supplementary submission – airport watch list
this is a david and goliath fight. i am therefore not going to pretend i am writing a legal submission. i am not a lawyer and don’t know how to write one. i will rather write my story. my truths. my facts. i should have been allowed to speak in court, and my words would not have been limited to two pages. however as part of the racist tricks being employed by judge neville, he is limiting my ability to communicate to the court. i will write my truths and he can decide to bin them if he so wishes. i have a lot of respect for the court but as an individual, judge neville has continuously given me reason not to respect him. this submission is to seek the order of the court to place my children on the airport watchlist. it is about: the risk of harm posed to my children from domestic violence environment when they are overseas, as they don’t get the protection of the australian police and their mother does not trust local police. race, and the attitudes of officers of the court (particularly judge neville) who unashamedly are using racist and white supremacist methods to put my children in harms way. methods they will never use on white children. limitations: this submission is constrained by the many limitations placed on me, which makes this entire hearing a complete sham. the constraints i face are from: my lawyer mr gavin howard who at key material times did not work in my best interest, and who i could also not sack (a right afforded to every human being in court) because judge neville made an order that forbids me from sacking my lawyer. judge neville treats me like he would during slavery times. that order is unjustified and racist, noting that it is better that i do not have a lawyer and i am allowed to speak for myself, than to have one that works against my best interest. judge neville who has used every racist and white supremacist trick he can find and is hell bent on ensuring the worst outcome for my children. the above constraints are explained in detail in paragraph named “c” the heading is “limitations – the details” basis of my request for airport watchlist order: there are many risks posed to my children when they are outside australia and the court is required to protect them to ensure their safety and security. domestic violence: the federal circuit court in australia has a zero tolerance for domestic violence. during the court hearing in may 2021, the honorable judge howe reiterated that fact. in court on 4th march 2022, ms yulay confirmed an incident in the [country c] in 2016, which was severe enough for her to contact her cousin in the [country r] and complain to her. this family member then reported to the department of foreign affairs and trade (dfat) that [ms yulay] had told her she, ([ms yulay]) had been assaulted by her husband, [mr yulay]. dfat then got in touch with [ms yulay] ([ms yulay] again confirmed this in court). in dfats documents presented to the court, [ms yulay] had confirmed to dfat that indeed she had been assaulted by her husband and was going to the local police station to report the case. [ms yulay] would not have confirmed a case of assault to a government official, and again state that “she is on her way to report the assault to the [country c] police if no assault had taken place. most murder cases resulting from domestic violent cases had started like this. that [ms yulay] did not report to the police and continued to expose my children to that environment is a fundamental risk to the children’s lives. [ms yulay] will definitely be killed or severely injured whilst overseas. i do not want my children to be collateral damage, or be affected when that happens. there has been several violent incidents perpetrated by [ms yulay]’s husband but judge neville had worked so hard to ensure i do not get the chance to author the wording of my own subpoena so that evidence can be provided to the court. he has refused every subpoena application i have made just so he can confidently say i did not bring more evidence (typical of racists!). though i have not been able to bring more evidence to the court (thanks to judge neville), one evidence is more than enough to protect the lives of my children. a court that has zero tolerance to domestic violence, that has a judge frustrate the applicant’s every effort to get a subpoena he himself authors should accept one reliable evidence from an australian government source as more than enough to help keep my children safe. i have witnessed white children being protected with such airport watchlist orders in this same court on the basis of the perception of risk alone. in this case evidence of violence has been provided and the same level of safety that is used to protect white children should also apply to my [coloured] children because their lives also matter. the family report, and [ms yulay]’s affidavit states clearly that [ms yulay] fears that i will kidnap the children. it is on this basis that the family consultant also recommended that the children be placed on the airport watchlist! the court has a moral responsibility to ensure the children are protected against any kidnapping, especially when a fear has been expressed by both parents, and also a specialist family consultant. [ms yulay] has stated in her affidavit and the family report that she does not trust [country b] police (so did not report sexual assault crime committed against [x], then 12 years old). she also did not report the assault from her husband to police in the [country c] but lied to a federal government officer about it. she has however contacted the australian federal police (afp) on more than three occasions per her affidavit. as she will never report criminal incidents that may impact the children when overseas, she should not be allowed to take them overseas so as to reduce the risk of harm to the children. it is important to emphasis that the family consultant in her report to the court also recommended that the children be placed on airport watchlist to keep them safe. in court on 4th march 2022, the other parties (respondent and icl) made a case that “nobody shows pictures of unhappy children” when pictures of me with my children, which provided evidence of happy moments was discussed. judge neville again referred to those comments when my lawyer again made reference to the pictures. similarly, nobody willingly brings evidence of violence their children have suffered to court, and the opposing lawyers and judge neville have fought my very effort to bring evidence to court. it is not that there is no evidence, the efforts of judge neville and [ms yulay] has made that not possible. c. limitations – the details 1) my legal representative mr gavin howard: a) in a bizarre and racist way, judge neville issued made an order on 23rd february 2022 which prevented me from sacking my lawyer even if he was not working in my best interest. as part of the federal circuit family violence cross-examination scheme, i was offered legal aid for the hearing. this legal aid therefore has mr howard taking charge of cross examination and the entire hearing. however mr howard clearly does not believe in my case and should not have been handling it. at one point i asked if he would not take the case and was hoping he would say yes, but he didn’t to my astonishment and i know i could not sack him. during slavery times, legal and judicial decisions were forced on [people of colour] but sadly, judge neville due to his racist and white supremacist behavior still believes i am to be subjected to slave era behaviours. his order is illegal and mr howard worked against my interest in the most material of times. i was better of without a lawyer, without the ability to cross-examine [ms yulay], and rather given the chance to speak for myself. judge neville’s order placed me at a disadvantage as i had a lawyer who worked against my interest. for example, the entire cross-examination of [ms yulay] was a sham, and provided no assistance to my case whatsoever. mr howard told me in plain english that i should not suggest to him which questions to ask, and then refused to ask [ms yulay] key and material questions about matters in her affidavit which could have shed a light, and given another perspective on materials in my own affidavit. question about the false rape allegation, convincing my daughter [x] to believe i sexually assaulted her, various assault allegations were material not just to the rape allegation but central to [ms yulay]’s credibility on other unproven allegations, my reactions and many other things written in my own affidavit. i would have done a better job for myself speaking for myself in court. i was ambushed in court on the 3rd and 4th of march 2022 with everybody in the courtroom, including judge neville, icl, mothers legal team and my lawyer mr howard working for [ms yulay]. mr howard thinks i should read dale carnegie’s “how to make friends and influence people” because everybody is not liking me. i don’t believe i am in court to be liked, and i understand i am not making friends. i in fact have read that book but i can assure mr howard, i don’t want to be friends or influence people i believe are racists! racists don’t like [ms yulay] either, but they love weak [coloured] people who can help them achieve their racist objectives. me not being liked does not mean judge neville can decide to take my right of fair representation and force me to work with a lawyer who is actively working against me. obviously the nicola gobbo case has not thought judge neville anything. b) prior to the hearing day, mr howard told me to drop my request for a airport watch list order. i refused. he then said he will not be speaking on the matter in court but i have to do it myself. i agreed. c) on court day 3rd march 2022, he requested i drop it again even though we have agreed i will handle it myself. again i disagreed. it was bizarre for me why my own lawyer will continue to harass me about my need to protect my children. d) his decision not to cross-examine [ms yulay] on her parenting skills regarding abusive environment to the children, rape and sexual assault allegations is central to his request to me to drop my airport watchlist order request. he is so keen to ensure that i do not get any evidence from the cross-examination that can help my request for the order. is this legal? in a democratic country like australia, can a judge force an applicant to work with a particular lawyer, who will mess up a case, and that same judge who has frustrated applicant to ensure he not get evidence from a subpoena, then sits to rule over the case to achieve his racist objective? this certainly cannot be happening in a country that practices the rule of law! 2) judge neville: he had always treated me with scorn and disrespect as compared to how he treats white self represented parties prior court day on 3rd march 2022. on september 2, 2021(or thereabout), during a directions hearing, he yelled at me when i confirmed i would make an application of racism and criminal behavior against the icl. he had prejudiced himself by yelling at me so it was not supposed to have sat the on case but he did. it was no surprise that he against me because that outcome was pre-determined. he also did not write his ruling so i can use for my appeal. in court on 3rd march 2022, when the issue above was brought up, he asked “why didn’t you appeal?.” this is typical of what racists and white supremacists will do. he knows he did not provide a written report of his ruling and knows that he is directing me to the one place where he knows he controls and i have no chance. based solely on allegations of sexual assault of my daughter by [ms yulay], judge neville told me he has made a decision not to allow my children to see me until he makes a final order on the case. this was to protect the children. i was therefore hoping that he would have taken a similar stance to protect my children by making a decision to grant an interim order for the children to be placed on airport watchlist until final hearing. judge neville refused and exposed my children to the risk of being taken overseas. he used covid as an excuse and even though i pointed out to him that the government was granting exemptions for overseas for excuses like to see family, he still refused and kept my kids at risk for over 18 months. [ms yulay] could have taken the children overseas like the over 800,000 australians who took advantage of exemptions. judge neville has no regard for the safety of my [country b] children. in court on 3rd march 2022, judge neville refused to recuse himself from the case despite his continuous bias towards him, and his racist and white supremacist views which was going to taint the outcome of this case. he continued to threaten a contempt of court action even during the case. how could he be fair when he showed so much anger and disdain for me? judge neville’s untrue claim to my lawyer that i had on many times been represented so he was not going to allow my lawyer’s request to re-write my affidavit as it was poorly written by me. i commenced this case in february 2020, and initially hired [s law firm] who attended one directions hearing on my behalf. she was to re-write my affidavit but it did not proceed as i could not afford her. i only had her for one court date. i continued to represent myself until i hired a second lawyer who filed a noas but could not proceed to represent me. the 3rd lawyer, mens legal service, represented me in court with regards to respondents rejection of my right to documents subpoenaed from department of home affairs. it ended after that. though i have not had any real legal representation, i found judge neville’s interest to peddle untruths about me having substantial legal representation at most times quite sad, shocking and unexpected of a judge. however very expected from a racist. judge neville has frustrated my efforts to gain documents from the department of home affairs so as to support my airport watchlist request. i have every right as a party to a case in court to author my own wording for my subpoena request irrespective of any subpoena any other party has made with different wordings. first the judge refuses to give me approval saying he is not required to, then after several months, again refuses to grant me approval when i point him to the rules. his reason for his refusal is that i should use a prior subpoena that does not seek the same material i seek. sadly, he now uses the same reason that i have only provided one evidence, when he is the one that has stopped me from gaining more evidence. judge neville’s obvious bias, and racist tricks has made this hearing a sham. he obviously has a pre-determined outcome and though he might have his way, one day, he will be exposed for the racist methods that he uses. again on the 3 september 2022 when his associate does not provide him with correct form on which to base his questions to me, he finds me the easy target to yell at for no real reason, even though the fault was from his associate (who had made the mistake). he continued to yell at me even though i was pointing to him that he was not referencing to the correct document. he forced me into submission and i had to answer based on the wrong document. his intimidatory tactics is racist as he does not do that to the white self represented parties. in court on 4th march 2022, judge neville was behaving like he was on opposing lawyers team. he used an argument from the opposing side to respond to my lawyer. my lawyer made mention of my pictures with my children proving my love for my children and the happy relationship i had with them. judge neville quickly rebuffed that comment by repeating the respondent’s lawyer’s argument that there most likely were many incidents where children were sad but “nobody shows pictures of sad children”. when i used same argument during my time in the witness box, judge neville questioned me saying “do you want me to stop children travelling overseas because of “just one assault incident”? he did not believe that again, “nobody shows evidence of children unhappy from assault”. the cross examination of respondent, [ms yulay] ([ms yulay]) by my lawyer was a complete sham as my lawyer refused to ask key questions that would have exposed the untruths in her affidavit. as i could not fire him, this man who did not believe in my case continues to represent me even though i am better off speaking for myself. in what world will a judge force a lawyer on a party to a case?
a) in a bizarre and racist way, judge neville issued made an order on 23rd february 2022 which prevented me from sacking my lawyer even if he was not working in my best interest. as part of the federal circuit family violence cross-examination scheme, i was offered legal aid for the hearing. this legal aid therefore has mr howard taking charge of cross examination and the entire hearing.
b) prior to the hearing day, mr howard told me to drop my request for a airport watch list order. i refused. he then said he will not be speaking on the matter in court but i have to do it myself. i agreed. c) on court day 3rd march 2022, he requested i drop it again even though we have agreed i will handle it myself. again i disagreed. it was bizarre for me why my own lawyer will continue to harass me about my need to protect my children. d) his decision not to cross-examine [ms yulay] on her parenting skills regarding abusive environment to the children, rape and sexual assault allegations is central to his request to me to drop my airport watchlist order request. he is so keen to ensure that i do not get any evidence from the cross-examination that can help my request for the order. is this legal? in a democratic country like australia, can a judge force an applicant to work with a particular lawyer, who will mess up a case, and that same judge who has frustrated applicant to ensure he not get evidence from a subpoena, then sits to rule over the case to achieve his racist objective? this certainly cannot be happening in a country that practices the rule of law!

written submissions on behalf of the respondent
2. the matters in dispute are as follows: 2.1. whether there should be some limited interim arrangements to allow [y] the opportunity to make an informed decision about whether she wishes to establish a relationship with the father, in the hopes that the relationship will be of benefit to her, and then require the parties to attempt to agree upon further progression or cessation of time. in the alternative, that there be an order that the children spend no time with the father, 2.2. whether there is utility in a s68b injunction preventing the father from contacting, locating or approaching the mother and children, and 2.3. whether there should be an order restricting the children’s international travel until they are aged 18 in recognition of a risk to them of leaving the australian jurisdiction. in the alternative, whether as the holder of sole parental responsibility, the mother should be able to determine whether and where the children may travel. the evidence of the applicant in this matter was extraordinary in that, by filing his own affidavit, the court was given an unfiltered insight into the applicant father’s entrenched negative attitude to the mother and her husband. the applicant has also himself filed submissions on 25 march 2022, ostensibly on the issue of restraint on international travel. again, that document assists the court to assess the risk to [y] of any order that explores a re-introduction to the father. issue 1: introduction of [y] to the father the strongest support for a programme of introduction of the possibility of a relationship between [y] and the father came from the family consultant, [ms g]. her evidence was curious and at times confusing. she confirmed that the mother has said she didn’t talk negatively to the children about the father, that [x] had said that her mother protected her from information to help her keep positive memories and that [y]’s expression of knowing nothing about the father is consistent with the mother not speaking poorly about him. in exploring [x]’s expressed view to not want to see the father, the consultant confirmed that [x] was mature and eloquent, considered in her views, and able to make the decision that was likely based on her own experience. she also confirmed that [x] was so worried about [y]’s safety in seeing the father that she would, in spite of her own concerns, none-the-less accompany [y] to keep her safe. how that evidence sits alongside her evidence that [x] was not wholly resistant to spending time with the father is beyond comprehension. ultimately, the family consultant gave very guarded support for the opportunity of a relationship between [y] and the father. the consultant’s evidence was that the benefit to [y] of being introduced to the possibility of developing a relationship with her father would be threefold: 8.1. a programme of supportive and encouraging counselling could assist her to be better able to make her own determination as to having a relationship with the father, 8.2. the father may be able to offer her support in her education or extra-curricular pursuits, and 8.3. the father may be able to offer her a different perspective on her cultural heritage. in a series of answers to the icl and the mother’s counsel, as well as some questions from his honour, the logistics of a programme for introduction were explored and amounted to: 9.1. the programme would commence with counselling for [y] to explore the possibility of meeting with the father, with the design and emphasis of that counselling to encourage her to consider meeting her father as a positive outcome for her, 9.2. that after a period of counselling and only when [y] is ready to do so, there would be very short periods of professionally supervised time, on approximately one occasion a fortnight, with reports from the supervisor and continued counselling for [y] to check in with her comfort and/or distress, 9.3. that the process would be expected to take at least a year, but that three unsuccessful visits would be sufficient to know that it was not working and could be stopped, 9.4. that the success of the programme to establish a relationship would be dependent on each of the mother and [x] being able to support [y]’s exploration of a relationship with the father, 9.5. that the fear, worry and/or anxiety of the mother and [x] would make supporting the reintroduction programme very difficult for them, 9.6. that [y] would be aware of and sensitive to her mother and [x]’s feelings around the re-introduction programme, making her position very difficult even if she were to feel positively about the possibility of meeting her father, 9.7. that there is a risk to [y] associated with her mother’s emotional and psychological health being adversely affected by efforts to support the re-introduction programme, 9.8. that the success of the re-introduction programme would be partially dependent on the mother and father being able to re-build trust, something that is unlikely to be possible even if they each access supportive counselling, 9.9. that the success of the re-introduction programme would be dependent on the motivation and insight of the father, and in particular his ability to sensitively and respectfully handle questions [y] may have about his absence from her life and any references he makes to [y]’s mother and [mr yulay]. for the proposed programme of introduction to be ordered to provide [y] with an opportunity to express a view (notwithstanding the views she has expressed clearly and consistently in these proceedings on earlier occasions), the court would have to be satisfied that the father would be of some benefit to [y] that would be lost if an attempt were not made to create the opportunity for a relationship. at present, [y] has no negative view of the father. for that to remain the case, the father would have to show significant sensitivity and restraint in any dealings with her, including not attempting to take the “father” role. nothing in the evidence would give the court any confidence that the father, the mother or [x] would be able to support the introduction of a relationship between [y] and the father in a way that would be other than stressful and distressing. in submissions filed on his behalf, it is said that the father has not contacted, approached or harassed the mother in the 2½ years since he returned to australia, and that the father’s calm and measured manner when giving evidence is suggestive of improved control. the evidence, including the submissions he filed on his own behalf on 25 march 2022, suggests that the father is completely unable to contain his attitude towards the mother and his behaviour towards others when he is slighted or when he feels disrespected. the following table of correspondence by the father is telling:

submissions
father repeats complaints of racism by court and his honour, rejects his legal advice and complains of the mother’s lack of parenting skills and her lies.
the description of “facts” in the father’s evidence when reviewing his email correspondence sits uncomfortably with [ms g]’s evidence that communication between [y] and the father (if it were to occur) would have to be factual and not denigrate the mother or her husband. the court could have no confidence on the available evidence that the father could contain himself in communication with [y]. the father has previously not taken every opportunity to spend time with [y], ceasing exercising time available to him under interim orders some months before ceasing time with [x] and discontinuing proceedings in february 2014. the father then took no steps to reconnect until late 2019, other than approaching [x] at the maternal grandfather’s funeral in 2017. in his oral evidence in answers to his honour, the father indicated that he had left the country in 2014 and given up the case as his mental health was so poor that the father was concerned that he was a risk to the children. he gave evidence that he engaged in some therapy through his church in 2018 for approximately four months. he has otherwise taken no steps to address whatever issues placed the children at risk in his care in 2014, other than to speak to members of his church to help him let things go and move on. the father’s unrestrained behaviour in these proceedings shows little evidence he has let things go. the father’s renewed commitment to a relationship with [y] is untested and is accompanied by a number of risks, including a risk to [y] of commencing time only to have the father again disappear without warning. it is of significance that the father’s evidence was of a strong, happy and fulfilling relationship for both he and [x] prior to february 2014, yet he withdrew completely. the court and the mother are asked to trust that this time, in the face of an extremely limited, slow and awkward process of introduction to [y], things will be different. there is no proposal for time to move beyond supervision and little evidence of a benefit to [y] of time that is not supervised. the court should not lightly order long term supervised time. it appears that the orders sought by the father would see the parties and [y] engaged in a long process that may not go anywhere. it involves a lot of time, effort and distress for the mother and both children with little evidence of benefit to weigh against that trouble. given the father’s entrenched negative view of the mother (and his tendency to abuse & denigrate those he disagrees with) it is not practicable for the parties to be expected to reach agreement about even the most basic arrangements for counselling/family therapy or [y]’s time with the father. the father’s evidence about his proposal for a graduated introduction to [y] via family therapy was embryonic, expressing no clear idea of process, mechanism, cost, or time. very clear in the father’s evidence is that if the family therapist’s recommendations did not accord with his own views then he would challenge that recommendation via the court. even in the event that a programme of introduction could be facilitated, the end point of the father’s proposal still requires mediation between the parents to agree upon a progression or cessation of time. the evidence before the court shows that such arrangements could not be successfully mediated with the almost inevitable result being the reinstitution of proceedings. issue 2: injunctions – s68b sought by the mother submissions filed on behalf of the father as to the s68b injunction have some force in that any injunction should not extend beyond the children attaining the age of 18 years. while it is true that upon his return to australia, the father has not directly harassed the mother the way he did over the period up to five years following separatio7, the context of that previous communication is important. it is also noted that measured, thoughtful and calm abuse directed towards or about the mother is none-the-less likely to be experienced by her as harassment. the father initiated court proceedings in february 2013 and discontinued them in february 2014. his communication directly with the mother during this period was limited9. following the discontinued proceedings, the father left the country and almost immediately commenced a campaign of abuse directed towards the mother including through third parties10. those messages are offensive, abusive, insulting but importantly, they are clearly the result of strong feeling and were described by the father as factual. that is also how he described the offensive, abusive, insulting and strongly felt emails to the court in february 2022. those emails and the arguably contemptuous submissions filed by the father on his own behalf show clearly the consequences of people not agreeing with the father. the unconstrained outbursts that are seen while in the shadow of proceedings expose a clear risk to the mother (and through her, the children) if the father is not successful in these proceedings. issue 3: injunctions – airport watch list sought by the father there are no proper grounds to justify the making of an injunction preventing the mother from travelling out of australia with the children. the mother has, by consent, sole parental responsibility. the father will have no orders for time with [x] and (at most) a very limited relationship with [y]. in his oral evidence, the father was clear that nothing could satisfy him of the children’s safety if travelling with the mother. his expressed argument grounding the concern is confusing. in his affidavit, in his evidence and in his submissions, the father includes the incident alleged against him at the maternal grandfather’s funeral in his complaints about the mother exposing the children to harm overseas. his other concern arises from the incident between the mother and her husband in february 2016, notwithstanding that the mother and children has travelled to the [country c] and elsewhere after this event. while the court had the benefit of evidence by the mother and her husband about this incident that would alleviate any reasonable concern, if taken at its highest, the incident does not ground a blanket refusal by the court to allow the children to travel. it is important to put the mother and children back in the position they enjoyed prior to the father adding the children to the airport watch list following the commencement of these proceedings. orders made on 1 december 2014 provided that the mother had authority to travel with the children and obtain passports for them. those orders should be noted to continue in any further orders made by the court.
independent children’s lawyer’s written submissions
confining the dispute these submissions are provided following the orders of judge neville on 4 march 2022. they address three matters. first, the arrangements for [y], if any, to spend time with the father, second, the orders sought concerning the airport watch list, and third, the proposed s 68b injunction. these submissions are directed toward the central matters in dispute. they address the findings that the independent children's lawyer submits the court can make and are necessary for determining the matter. each party in evidence asserted a range of contentions concerning historical issues arising during their relationship and post-separation. the independent children's lawyer's position is that the determination of the various factual conflicts is unnecessary for the determination of the children's best interests in the way in which the dispute has been confined between the parties. the court can make findings in the children's best interests and engage with the best interests as they emerge in the present situation without needing to determine prior factual disputes, however hotly contested they may be in the parties' affidavit material. accordingly, the independent children's lawyer has confined these submissions. evidence of the father several essential matters flow from the evidence of the father. they are: - the father demonstrated limited insight into his behaviour's impact on the mother. his focus appeared to be on making counter-allegations against her. this persisted in his evidence in the witness box, despite indicating that 'in hindsight' emails he had sent were unhelpful to him or improper. at one level, the father's focus was explained by his need to respond to various allegations made by the mother. that can only partially explain the father's apparent lack of insight. his behaviour towards the mother was quite problematic during periods before allegations concerning events in 2017. taking the father's evidence at its highest, he put behind him his past with the mother and specific criticisms of her in his evidence. that could not be accepted where in his evidence, the father did not appear to appreciate his failure to be willing to tender an apology to the mother for his conduct. his was that he had to be tendered an apology for unspecified behaviour for him to apologise. this significant opportunity for him to offer an unconditional apology sat uncomfortably with his proposition. that lacked a child focus and did not sit comfortably with the father’s denial of maintenance of feelings of ill-will towards the mother. evidence of the court child expert the court child expert gave evidence through the report and in the witness box. important aspects of that evidence were:- the identification of the potential loss for [y] of a relationship with the father as being a loss of an ‘opportunity to have a relationship’ rather than the loss of a current relationship. the court child expert’s position was that, in her opinion, the loss of the potential relationship should overwhelm other factors, presumably including risk factors. despite this evidence, there was some later acknowledgement that risk factors for both children were significantly important. that it was critical to the success of any attempt to re-establish, or establish, a relationship between [y] and her father to have the support of the mother. that evidence was put as high as that support was essential for such a relationship to have any chance of success. [x] was very concerned about [y] spending time with the father, which psychologically impacted [x]. the idea of the father spending time with [y] had a psychological impact on the mother, which would have a necessary flow-on effect on both [y] and [x]. that the father had a negative view of the mother. that negative view was entrenched. the mother had a similarly entrenched negative view of the father. based on her observations of the parties, neither of them was likely to change their entrenched negative view of the other. that [y] had a relationship with all the mother's current husband, which was that of a child and father relationship. there was an artificial nature to any relationship that could be created or sustained, or maintained through supervised time. evidence of the mother the evidence of the mother was largely unremarkable. she indicated a range of things that could give her greater comfort if time was ordered between the father and the children. however, she was also clear about how that comfort would not alleviate the impacts on her and potentially on the children. parenting submissions the independent children’s lawyer submits that there should be no order for time between the children and the father. the matters that point to that conclusion are: the father's lack of insight into his behaviour towards the mother and his inability and unwillingness to offer any form of apology to her for some of his past behaviours would give the court little hope that the father would be able to restrain himself during engagements with the child, whether time was supervised or not. the father is unaware of how he presents to himself and others, describing his engagement in the witness box as having been calm when times it could be fairly described as quite elevated. the court could have no faith in the practical amelioration of the flow-on effect to the children of the impact on the mother flowing from time occurring. supervised time would not ameliorate that issue on the evidence. the loss of opportunity to have a relationship cannot be appropriately subordinated to risk issues. the risks are serious. they are a diminution of the ability of the mother to provide practical support for the child with the result of neglect and psychological harm. that psychological harm included psychological harm to both [x] and [y]. the impact on [x] of the proposed time was significant where the evidence was she would attend time solely because she felt the need to protect her sister from the father. these risks cannot be guarded against in this dispute by orders for supervised time or any other form of order- simply put, the dispute has been too vicious and too long-running for any confidence to be had in measures that may alleviate risk. the court child expert’s evidence focused on the opportunity to have a relationship. the focus may have been appropriate for the expert's role, but the court's focus is different. the court must assess the benefit of a meaningful relationship with the father balanced against the risks. the benefit derived from a relationship with the father in a meaningful relationship is quite a different from a general assertion about the benefit of a relationship. a meaningful relationship is a relationship that has a particular meaning as outlined in mazorski & allbright [2007] famca 520 as approved by the full court in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92. the only advantage of a relationship in general expressed by the court child expert is the opportunity for the child to know the father. this has a difficulty where the father's evidence is that he abandoned his relationship with both children in 2014 without any explanation. in light of that evidence, the issue arises as to why would the court commence a relationship with someone who is effectively a stranger when there is every possibility the father may repeat that behaviour. whatever the rights and wrongs of the situation, the court would find that on the evidence, it is simply inconceivable that the mother would be in any practical position to support a relationship between the children and the father. this is not a case where it is appropriate to change residence to deal with that issue. therefore, any attempt to start a relationship between [y] and the father is doomed to fail on this aspect alone whilst in search of some possible potential benefit of ‘knowing the father’. the court is enjoined to make an order least likely to lead to further litigation. the father's evidence concerning the practicability of his orders and how he would react to an opinion expressed by an expert if he disagreed with it was that he would recommence litigation. that was unhelpful and indicative of the ongoing level of animosity and the perennial tennis match of litigation that this family will be subjected to if orders for time are made. it is without controversy that each of the children is established and doing well at school. although the father was unwilling to make that concession in evidence, that is a credit to the mother. there appears little utility in disrupting that arrangement for a vague possible benefit of an 'opportunity to know the father'. it is difficult to see now how the benefits of an opportunity to have a relationship could outweigh the potential damage caused by a disruption of the current situation to both children. the father's narrative that the mother is completely opposed to him must be treated with some caution. the reasons for caution are twofold. first, the father's suggestion that the mother would do anything possible to involve the police against him was not borne out through a chance meeting of the parties at a store by chance in 2020. second, during the family report interviews, it became apparent that the father's narrative that the mother denigrated him to the children was not borne out. the father's written submissions concerning airport watch list matters are again replete with paranoid and aggressive claims of racism and other issues which must cause any reasonable person to question the benefits to the children of being exposed to such attitudes. for the above reasons, the independent children's lawyer submits that time should not commence. that is a sad and difficult conclusion for the court to reach. inevitably, the father will feel aggrieved by such a position. however, the reality is that the father decided in 2014 to step away from the children. that decision has created the current situation that is before the court. the airport watch list order the father seeks orders that the children be placed on the airport watch list until they turn 18. when asked to articulate his reason for that order, the father was clear that his concern was that the mother would not take the children to the police or other appropriate authorities if something happened when she was overseas of children. the father relied on largely unspecified allegations of family violence. the father relied upon things people in his community told. when pointed out to him repeatedly that there was only a single incident that might be described as an assault that was admitted and recorded, it was a point that he was able to concede. however, the father preferred to rely on several pieces of information given to him by persons he did not name and did not bring to court. this approach did not assist his case. however, what can be observed concerning family violence is that there has not been any complaint made to the child court expert, any complaint made to the children's school, nor any complaint made to any child welfare authority concerning the children expressing having witnessed family violence. rather than painting a picture of violence in the mother’s home to the court child expert, the children spoke in glowing terms of the mother's husband being affectionate. at its highest, the father is concerned about the mother's ability to engage with authorities because of a single incident in the [country c]. the concern is misplaced in reading the evidence. the evidence demonstrates that the mother could engage with embassy officials when they contacted her. the reality is that no harm befell the children, and certainly, they were not traumatised in any lasting way. there is no valid reason to impose the airport watch list restriction as sought by the father. the evidence does not support such a restrictive injunction. there is simply no ability on the evidence to exercise the court's injunctive power. parental responsibility the independent children's lawyer acknowledges that the father sought an order for equal shared parental responsibility. however, clearly in his oral evidence, he conceded the need for the mother to have sole parental responsibility. this sat uncomfortably with his narrative of the mother and his evidence that there could be no trust in the mother to make decisions in the best interests of the children. unfortunately, this inconsistency was not explained by the father. the evidence of the long-running dispute between these parties and their inability to communicate about very basic matters demonstrate that the parties have simply no ability to communicate in any practical way that would allow an order for equal shared parental responsibility to be made. it must also be observed that the mother has been exercising parental responsibility without complaint for a significant period. in that regard, the court can trust her to continue to do so and make decisions that are in the children's best interests. the s 68b injunctive order there appears to be significant utility in the s 68b injunction sought. the father says it is unnecessary and points to behaviour since he has been in the country. the father gives no evidence of any restriction such an order would place upon him or how he would be disadvantaged by the making of that order. it follows that the father’s position at its highest is he says that injunction is not necessary. that sits in a very problematic way with the expert evidence concerning the mother needing to support any relationship between the father and the children for such a relationship to be successful> in essence, he says that a pillar of safety for the mother should be removed in circumstances where it causes him no inconvenience. it is difficult to understand how or why that position should be followed. against that is the father's affidavit evidence and his submissions supporting the airport watch list order. they are uniformly negative and derogatory towards the mother and anyone he perceives as being 'against him'. he even goes so far as to lash out without any basis at his counsel. the attitude is aggressive and profoundly concerning- it points towards a level of protection being accorded to the mother and the children. confined responses to submissions the independent children’s lawyer makes the following confined responses to the various written submissions:- the court could have no confidence that family therapy would be effective given the long-running and entrenched nature of the dispute and the florid presentation of the father. the concept advanced by the father's submissions that his evidence was 'calm' did not reflect the father's presentation in the witness box. the father's evidence was an example of an attempt to engage in an argument and avoid answering any question directly. it appeared more important to the father that he ask his own questions and avoid answering those of others. in the event that the father's submissions as to his 'calmness' are accepted, then that is even more concerning, this is the behaviour he considers appropriate when calm. it is inappropriate behaviour and suggests he has no insight into how that behaviour may impact people generally and the children in particular. the father's submissions concerning the airport watch list order are profoundly concerning. he has misunderstood the provisions of s 102na. his constant 'maintaining of the rage' and long, convoluted allegations of racism when he says he knows they are against his interest points to the alarming suggestion that he is only engaging in these proceedings to harass the mother or cause her difficulty. the allegations against the court and mr howard in the father's submissions are concerning. they either indicate a severe lack of understanding on the father's part, a serious issue of distorted cognitive processes, or some attempt by the father to distort the record. in the event, his allegations are entirely unsupported and unsupportable. there can be no valid criticism of the court or mr howard. conclusion this is a sad and difficult matter. the attitude of the father and his level of conviction that he has been ganged up on and discriminated against has no basis in reality, yet complicates the situation. the father’s abandoning of the children at a very young age further complicates the decision of the court, particularly when he did not explain his choice to the older child. the ongoing hostility directed towards the mother makes the situation more difficult. yet those matters and those canvassed above point to a conclusion which the independent children’s lawyer says is inevitable- that there should be no order for time to commence in such uncertain circumstances. where there can be no ascertainable or hopeful benefit of a meaningful relationship and where the risks are so stark commencing time is not in the children’s best interests.
outline of principle  the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child’s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child’s best interests (s.65daa(2))  ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s 60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues:
the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility. ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words “meaningful involvement”. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting:
the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements.  ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]–[199]):
[196] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) — (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than “1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays” or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve “both” parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children. ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines “meaningful” as “full of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system”. “meaning” is defined as “having intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)”. a second definition is “conveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive”. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines “meaning” (in generalised use) as “significance”. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as “full of meaning, significant”. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as “expressive or significant: a meaning look”. [26] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.  4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. "[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms." because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be "best" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing.  1] in coming to our conclusions we accept as appropriate the interpretation of “meaningful relationship” set out by brown j in mazorski. consistently with our conclusions we also agree with the reasoning of bennett j in g & c. [122] in reaching these conclusions, we also consider the legislation requires a court to focus on the benefit to the child of a meaningful or significant relationship. no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child’s best interests.
consideration and disposition
13 january 2022 dear associate, hh and all parties, thank you very much for your email. please see below my responses which are all factual: 1) i am increasingly frustrated by the back and forth of communications on this matter. i am tired, sick and suffering anxiety about the pattern of actions aimed at frustrating me. this email could have been sent in september 2021, but no, you people decided to ignore it. when i followed up in december 2021, i received an email from you telling me a lie, that as a self representing applicant, i am not discriminated against and i have the same rights as lawyers in the issue of subpoena.. when i show you evidence that your position is wrong, you now continue your actions to frustrate me further. my statement to you and hh is that, if your plan is to wear me out, then you are succeeding. because i am worn out! 2) regarding the matter that hh requests i be formally cautioned on risks i run by continually making slanderous, bordering on libelous accusations against icl. my response is: a) the undeniable fact remains that i, [mr zahir] made a formal application against the icl accusing her of being a racist, a criminal and lacking morals. if hh is not aware of this, he should check the court records. there is no reason that i cannot refer to the factual information that i indeed filed an application in court against the icl, [ms t] claiming that she is all i have said, a racist and a criminal. on what basis is that fact slanderous? b) doesn't this statement attributed to hh make him prejudiced against me? a position he has taken throughout this case? icl is a qualified lawyer, if she wants to sue me, why cant she go ahead? will hh's position make any difference or stop her from suing me if indeed she wants to? is hh now officially showing his face as an advocate or lawyer for the icl? c) on the 2nd of september 2021 when i made it clear i will be filing an application for the icl to be discharged, hh yelled at me, and disrespectfully attacked me making comments to ask how dare i make such accusations against the icl. hh can refer to court audio for the evidence. his honour judge neville had not given himself the opportunity to even wait till he read my formal application and the evidence i will present. he decided even before my evidence was submitted to yell at me and attack me for daring to accuse the icl. would i have ever won the case, i knew i would never! hh judge neville was already prejudiced against me and i had no chance. why will judge neville continue in this prejudice? d) throughout this case, i have watched silently as judge neville yells and belittles me in court. i have observed silently that he never does that to the white self represented people. on one occasion, i listened in admiration as judge neville engaged a lady, i believe her name sounded like "[ms u]" in a dialogue that lasted about 30 minutes. the lady kept providing the same responses to hh's questions and he kept repeating himself so the lady could answer in the expected way. hh was very lovely and kind, and i wondered why he was always rude and disrespectful to me in similar circumstances when i did not give the responses he wanted (just like that woman [ms u]). personally, as a general rule, i respect the authority vested in people to do their jobs, but i have strong opinions on people who treat other people based on the colour of their skins. it does not matter if one is the prime minister, supreme court judge, or president. if you treat [people of colour] horribly because you believe yourself to be a white supremacist, i have zero respect for you. only people with no common sense treat people differently based on the colour of their skins the court is the last place i expect to see that, unfortunately it is always on display. e) similarly on same september 2nd 2021 (i believe), hh was was asking me questions. the document he should be referring to was what icl submitted (draft consent minute). however his associate had made a mistake and not provided him with that. i obviously could not immediately answer his questions becuase he was looking at a different document. instead of blamining his associate for not giving him the required documents, he began to yell at me. something he does not do to white self represented people. my message to you hh is clear, you may get away with disenfranchising me, but one day, you will be exposed by someone with more resources to investigate you, and all you have achieved in your career will be destroyed. i am a little fly, destroying me will give you nothing! maybe temporary happiness. but in the end, you all will be exposed! one day, it will happen. f) i have observed the court protect white children even when the lowest risk exists. i have been in court and witnessed white children being protected by court orders without even any proper evidence of risk to the children. this court ignored my request for my children to be placed on airport watchlist for over 15 months under the excuse of covid and that borders are shut. even though i kept on saying more than 500,000 australians had been given exemptions to travel overseas, hh continued to ignore me. the lives of my [coloured] children do not matter to this court. like always, white supremacists use whatever means they can get to harm [people of colour] and their children, and sometimes they enlist the help of weaker [people of colour] members of the [people of colour] community. in this case where a weak party to the case has presented them with an opportunity to destroy my [coloured] children, this court has done nothing but enjoy the task of making sure my children are put at risk! hopefully, one day, it will be your own family members! 3) with respect to question that "hh requests that the applicant please explain why the court would grant leave to issue a subpoena to the department of home affairs when one has already been directed to that department. the subpoena to the department home affairs was issued on 19 may 2021 and documents were produced shortly thereafter" my response is that this question makes no sense. the wording in the icl subpoena request is different from the wording in mine. the documents provided in a subpoena are dependent on the wording of the request.. what i am requesting is not the same as what was previously requested by icl so it does not make sense for this question to be asked if the two request documents are read. secondly, the icl is not my lawyer. i do not depend on her to make my case. i have stated time and time again, that the icl does not want what is best for my children. i have accused her of being a racist, and a criminal, who is working against the interest of my children, her clients. that accusation is in an application i have filed in the courts (please refer). i do not expect her to make any case to advance the interest and safety of my children. as the applicant, i make and request for materials that advance my interest and will not depend on someone i have accused of being a racist and a criminal especially when the request she made is different from what i am making. of course, as hh is acting as if he is the advocate for icl, he can continue on his position and do whatever he likes. the constitution grants him that power. kind regards, [mr zahir] ... 22 february 2022 judge neville, you write to me asking me to give reasons for the subpoena. i respond to tell the individual will not provide any information unless he is subpoenaed. armed with that information you pull one of your stupid white supremacist tricks that you stupid racists use in court to ask that i let him produce an affidavit first. fool! if he could provide an affidavit, then why will i need a subpoena? you have not had enough of me when you tell and try to intimidate me in court, you just have to make sure i am unable to provide any useful evidence. a man of such dishonor, being referred to as "your honour?" . nonsense! keep going with your racist behaviours. one day you will be exposed to the whole world. [mr zahir] ... 23 february 2022 i wish judge neville to note that no judge using racist white supremacist tactics can force a lawyer on me. idiot!!! any lawyer who demonstrates to me that he/she is intended to harm my case will not have the opportunity to represent me. any lawyer is required to deminstrate that he/she is going to use his best skill & expertise to serve my best interest. a stupid moronic judge like neville who uses racist & white supremacist tactics can do whatever he wants except force his stupid orders of representation on me. idiotic judge neville thinks he is better human because he uses white supremacist tactics?. stupid idiot!!!

[1] the court had earlier made an order under s.102na family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”) for the father to secure legal representation. at the trial, he was represented by very experienced counsel, after forcing his previous lawyer under s.102na to withdraw. on one specific issue relating to an airport “watch-list” order, the father made his own submissions, noted below.[2] among many places, see transcript at pp.98, and 103 – 104.[3] all references, unless otherwise noted, are taken from the transcript, dated 3rd and 4th march 2022. references will be “t” followed by the relevant page number(s).[4] t 29.[5] t 30.

[51] brown j’s remarks in this regard were endorsed by the full court in moose & moose [2008] famcafc 108; (2008) flc 93-375 at [69], and more recently by a differently constituted full court in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92; (2009) 41 fam lr 483 at [115] & [121]. more recently still, a further full court in collu & rinaldo [2010] famcafc 53 at [335], similarly endorsed brown j’s remarks. the same remarks of brown j in mazorski v albright were also endorsed by the full court in sigley v evor [2011] famcafc 22; (2011) 44 fam lr 439 at [131] – [136].[52] ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 at p.211 [150].[53] ams v aif (1999) clr 160 at p.228 [204] & [205]. of course, the comments by both kirby & hayne jj are in a legislative context different to that which operates today. accepting that qualification, respectfully, their honour’s comments, in my view, are nonetheless important and apposite to the matters currently before the court.[54] mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92; (2009) 41 fam lr 483 at [121] – [122].
