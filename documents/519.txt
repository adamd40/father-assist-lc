the proceedings before me
the proceedings before judge carter  referred to the totality of the evidence prior to stating that she had ‘significant concerns regarding the mother’s mental health’ (at [201]), (b) stated that the father appeared to have repeatedly and inappropriately involved the children in the dispute between the parents, and that he had demonstrated limited insight into how this had been destructive of the mother’s relationship with the two older children (at [210]), (c) stated that the mother’s presentation raised significant concern about her mental health and parenting capacity (at [211]), (d) noted that the mother had failed to undergo an independent psychiatric assessment, refused to answer questions about her mental health, was estranged from her family and that she presented as ‘an emotionally fragile, very guarded, overly suspicious, hypersensitive and perhaps paranoid woman, with eccentric and possibly delusional beliefs around privacy and confidentiality’ (at [213] -[216]), (e) considered that as the mother appeared to be reasonably functional, the risks to the children in the mother’s care were not such that the time needed to be supervised or significantly curtailed (at [223]), (f) noted that it remained an option for the mother to promptly obtain an independent psychiatric assessment to confirm her assertion that her parenting was not impaired by mental illness and if she did so, and the parties were unable to agree on care arrangements, that may constitute a sufficient change of circumstances such that further proceedings may be appropriate (at [225]).

matter. however, despite the parties’ hostility and lack of communication, they both propose that the parties have equal shared parental responsibility for the children. although i have some concern about the workability of that order, i will not stand in the way of the parties’ agreed position. both parties have much to offer the children, and neither seems better placed than the other to make decisions for the children’s long-term care, welfare and development.
the law
the evidence of the parties
the father’s evidence  that the mother behaves irrationally and has clear mental health issues. despite that and the orders of judge carter, the mother has not obtained an independent psychiatric assessment in respect of her capacity or mental health, (b) that all three children live in his primary care with the two older boys refusing to spend any face-to-face time with their mother, (c) that [z] has told him she would like to attend [l school] with her brothers, but that the mother refuses to consider any option other than [t school] for [z], (d) that if the dispute between the parents is not resolved now as to responsibility for education, the dispute will arise again in the future and will place enormous pressure on [z]. indeed, the father deposes that the only way in which litigation and disputation can be avoided with respect to education matters is for an order for sole parental responsibility for education to be made, (e) to various examples of what he says is the mother’s uncompromising attitude towards the children and their education including: (i) the mother’s refusal to agree to [z] being in enrolled in secondary school and that the only reason [z] ended up being enrolled in [u school] at [suburb f] was because it was the default school for her given her primary residence, (ii) the mother’s refusal to consider or abide by court orders made, (iii) the mother’s objection to certain teachers teaching the children, and her demands that the children be moved to other classes, (iv) the mother’s ‘tirades and rants’ against parents of [z]’s friends, (v) the mother’s complaints about [l school] not permitting her to access the school’s portal, in circumstances where she has failed to accept the terms and conditions for access set out in the school’s business notice, (f) that he is willing to keep the mother informed of all significant matters pertaining to the children’s education and to provide her with copies of their school reports and details of parent teacher interviews so that she can attend if she wishes, and (g) that he does not understand the mother’s complaints in respect of alleged breaches of privacy or disclosure of confidential information.   that all three children live in his primary care with the two older boys refusing to spend any face-to-face time with their mother, (c) that [z] has told him she would like to attend [l school] with her brothers, but that the mother refuses to consider any option other than [t school] for [z], (d) that if the dispute between the parents is not resolved now as to responsibility for

the mother’s evidence  that she has been notified that the ‘living arrangements’ case (which i take to be the decision and orders of judge carter referred to earlier) has been overturned, (b) that the father has delayed or destroyed educational opportunities for the children. she says, by way of example, that he delayed the pursuit by the mother of a scholarship opportunity for one of the children at l school in 2018, (c) that the father was previously opposed to the children attending private schools, (d) that she has supported her children in their education, including by seeking information about schools for them, checking up on their calendars, checking their school reports, volunteering at school and extracurricular activities and following up on tasks they are required to complete, (e) that the father has treated her in a derogatory way, or referred to her in a derogatory way, and in a manner that she says contravenes intervention orders. she also says that she has been ‘gaslighted’ by the father, (f) that the father has ‘clipped z’s ‘wings’ and gives examples of what she says is the lack of support provided by the father to z, (g) that the father has by ‘deliberate unspoken acts’ caused z to stop performing arts, and take up sports, which ‘has created a significant injury risk which could potentially end her athletics’. the mother also says, in relation to sport, that the father has encouraged z to play sport like her brothers. the mother says that this has occurred ‘at the expense of her [z’s] own talents’, (h) the universal declaration of human rights, information from the attorney-general’s department, and the united nation’s convention of the rights of the child, which she asserts is relevant in this matter, (i) that l school reinforces gender stereotypes and unequal treatment of women, (j) that t school would be the best school for z. among other things, the mother has included in her affidavit material information about the asserted benefits of single sex education for girls and has conducted her own analysis of l school and t school.   that the father has delayed or destroyed educational opportunities for the children.

arrangement for the payment for private school fees is unsafe due to person paying refusing to rule out (via lawyer in late nov/early dec 2021) restriction, obligation, detriment on children and parents of children, as a result of the private school fee payments. the private arrangement is unsafe also due to a refusal to define "authentic gift'"' (see my first affirmed affidavit: annexures 6 and 7 for context). a relevant fact is that i have a cause of action against my mother, regarding alleged defamation of myself (see paragraphs 128-130 of my first affirmed affidavit dated 8 february 2022) therefore, there is no consent from myself to enrolment at [l school]. i do not wish or intend to be based in melbourne in the near future, and want flexibility for all my children's futures in secondary schools (and universities) without restrictions (including location restrictions). i continue to not consent to my sons' enrolment at [l school] until such time that a safe deed/agreement for the payment of private school fees exists, which accurately and clearly reflects the authentic gift continually offered, for more than a decade (ie. since the children were born). paragraph 57 in my first affirmed affidavit (dated 8 february 2022):" i will not consent to a coercive funding agreement. the private funding deed/agreement must safeguard flexible futures for parents and all children."
