a man who was consumed by the need for control or who was unable to function effectively as a prosocial positive role model for [x]. he appeared to have a history of stable employment, a seemingly stable relationship with his partner [ms d], no independent evidence accepted to date by the court of family violence or criminal offending, or a failure to comply with orders of the court.[9]
open to considering future additional midweek time up until a shared care arrangement when the child was older...however the mother was unsure what age she would agree/be willing to consider agreeing this.[11]
significant improvements to their communication with communication now occurring via email and what was said to be a recently shared telephone discussion about [x]’s needs which remained respectful and child focussed.[12]

the mother’s proposed relocation  in determining a parenting case that involves a proposal to relocate the residence of a child either within australia or overseas, the following principles apply: • the welfare or best interests of the child, as the case may be under the relevant legislation remains the paramount consideration but it is not the sole consideration. • a court cannot require the applicant for the child’s relocation to demonstrate “compelling reasons” for the relocation of a child’s residence contrary to the proposition that the welfare of the child would be better promoted by maintenance of the existing circumstances: • it is necessary for a court to evaluate each of the proposals advanced by the parties. • a court cannot proceed to determine the issues in a way which separates the issue of relocation from that of residence and the best interests of the child. there can be no dissection of the case into discrete issues, namely a primary issue as to who should have residence and a further or separate issue as to whether the relocation should be 'permitted'." • the evaluation of the competing proposals (properly identified) must weigh the evidence and submissions as to how each proposal would hold advantages and disadvantages for the child's best interests. • it is necessary to follow the legislative directions espoused in s.60b and s.68f of the family law act (cth) 1975. the wording of s.68f(2) makes clear that the court must consider the various matters set out in (a) – (l) of that subsection. • the object and principles of s60b provide guidance to a court's obligation to consider the matters in s68f(2) that arise in the context of the particular case. • it is to be expected that reasons for decision will display three stages of analysis and: a court will identify the relevant competing proposals, for each relevant s68f(2) factor, a court will set out the relevant evidence and the submissions with particular attention to how each proposal is said to have advantages and/or disadvantages for that factor and make findings on each factor as the court thinks fit having regard to s60b, • as one, but only one, of the matters considered under s68f(2), the reasons for the proposed relocation as they bear upon the child's best interests will be weighed with the other matters that are raised in the case, rather than treated as a separate issue. paragraph 9.63 of b and b: family law reform act 1995 is no longer an accurate statement of the law. • the ultimate issue is the best interests of the children and to the extent that the freedom of a parent to move impinges upon those interests then it must give way. • even where the proposal is made to remove the child to another country, courts will not necessarily restrain such moves, despite the inevitable implications they have for the child's contact with, and access to, the other parent. on the basis of the prior steps of analysis, a court will determine and explain why one of the proposals is to be preferred, having regard to the principle that the child’s best interests are the paramount but not sole consideration. • the process of evaluating the proposals must have regard to the following issues: a) none of the parties bears an onus: • in determining a parenting case that involves a proposal to relocate the residence of a child, neither the applicant nor the respondent bear the onus to establish that a proposed change to an existing situation or continuation of an existing situation will best promote the best interests of the child. that decision must be made having regard to the whole of the evidence relevant to the best interests of the child. b) the importance of a party's right to freedom of movement: • in determining a parenting case that involves a proposal to relocate the residence of a child, care must be taken by a court to ensure that where applicable, it frames orders which in both form and substance are congruent with a party's rights under s92 of the constitution, where applicable. • in determining a parenting case that involves a proposal to relocate the residence of a child and in deciding what is in the best interests of the child, the court must consider the arrangements that each parent proposes for the child to maintain contact with the other and, if necessary, devise a regime which would adequately fulfil the child’s rights to regular contact with a parent no longer living permanently in close physical proximity. if the court is not satisfied that suitable arrangements have been made for the child to have contact with the other parent, it may be necessary for the court to order a regime which would best meet the right of the child to know and have physical contact with both its parents. matters of weight should be explained: • in determining a parenting case that involves a proposal to relocate the residence of a child, a court must consider all the relevant matters referred to in ss60b and 68f(2) and then indicate to which of those matters it has attached greater significance and how those relevant matters balance out. • in a parenting case that involves a proposal to relocate the residence of a child, no single factor should determine the issue of which proposal is preferred by a court.[25]
a) none of the parties bears an onus:
b) the importance of a party's right to freedom of movement:
whilst the statutory framework does not deal differently or specifically with cases involving a proposed relocation from other parenting cases, such cases attract the description of “relocation cases” because they bring into sharp focus the central issue of balancing statutory imperatives concerning children’s best interests in the context of the legitimate and competing interests of parents. the task is to achieve, by the application of the law, orders which are legitimate by reference to both “best interests” considerations and the rights of parents, including a right to choose where the parent lives. in some cases, the determination of “best interests” may well mean that one party’s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child’s “best interests” being served by orders which do not give one parent “optimal” arrangements or outcomes.[28]
it is not in doubt that an expert’s opinion, which is based on an appropriate foundation and given by a suitably qualified person, will carry substantial weight. departure from an expert report in such circumstance requires careful consideration by a trial judge. however, the ultimate decision still must be that of the trial judge. the weight to be given to a family report was explained by the full court in hall & hall [1979] famca 73, (1979) flc 90-713 at 78,819 as follows: in view of the comments in this case as to the weight to be given to a family report, we feel it may be helpful to make certain observations which we stress are of a general nature. (a) there is no magic in a family report. a judge is not bound to accept it and there should never be any suggestion that the counsellor is usurping the role of the court or that the judge is abdicating his responsibilities. in wood [1976] famca 70, (1976) flc 90-098 at p. 75,447, harris and harris [1977] famca 67, (1977) flc 90-276, (1977) 29 f.l.r. 285. (b) family reports are meant to be, and almost invariably are, valuable and relevant material to assist a judge in forming his ultimate conclusions. when those views coincide with the judgment of the court, it is not because they have been accepted automatically but because the judge has found them consistent with the rest of the body of evidence before him. (c) while the counsellor’s views will normally have weight with the court because of his expertise and experience, the counsellor does not usually have the same opportunity as the trial judge to weigh the evidence, observe the demeanour of the witnesses in court under examination and cross-examination, and make findings of fact based on evidence before the court which might not have been available to the counsellor. (d) hence, the counsellor’s assessment of the parties may often be based upon facts which the counsellor has accepted but which turn out to be wrong, or favourable or unfavourable views formed by the counsellor from interviewing the parties without the opportunity to test in depth the credit of persons who may in court, and under cross-examination, or in the face of evidence of other witnesses, prove to be of a different character from that which the counsellor has accepted. (e) sometimes the family report will necessarily be neutral. while the court will be assisted by a positive view, there will be many cases where the counsellor, quite properly, will conclude that the child's welfare will be equally well served, or, regrettably in some cases, equally ill served by either party. (f) whether the report contains a positive recommendation, or whether it be neutral, whether the report is accepted by the judge or whether it is not, the report will still serve the court well and assist the court’s investigation. a counsellor, therefore, need not be disturbed if a recommendation is not accepted because the court has had the advantage of much more material and much more examination in depth than was available to the counsellor.[32]
parental responsibility  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. note: the presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61b. it does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65daa). (2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or (b) family violence. (3) when the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order. (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.[33]
section 60cc factors  the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to or exposed to abuse and neglect or family violence.[34]   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to or exposed to abuse and neglect or family violence.[34]
section 60cc(2)(a) – the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents
section 60cc(2)(b) – need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
section 60cc(3) – additional considerations any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child’s parents, and (ii) other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity: (i) to participate in making decisions about major long‑term issues in relation to the child, and (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child  the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from: (i) either of his or her parents, or (ii) any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis the capacity of (i) each of the child’s parents, and (ii) any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family  examples of behaviour that may constitute family violence include (but are not limited to): (a) an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or (d) repeated derogatory taunts, or (e) intentionally damaging or destroying property, or (f) intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, or (g) unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member's family, of his or her liberty.[36]   for the purposes of this act, a child is exposed to family violence if the child sees or hears family violence or otherwise experiences the effects of family violence. (4) examples of situations that may constitute a child being exposed to family violence include (but are not limited to) the child: (a) overhearing threats of death or personal injury by a member of the child's family towards another member of the child's family, or (b) seeing or hearing an assault of a member of the child's family by another member of the child's family, or (c) comforting or providing assistance to a member of the child's family who has been assaulted by another member of the child's family, or (d) cleaning up a site after a member of the child's family has intentionally damaged property of another member of the child's family, or (e) being present when police or ambulance officers attend an incident involving the assault of a member of the child's family by another member of the child's family.[37]  if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family -any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following: (i) the nature of the order, (ii) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter, whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
