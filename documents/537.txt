oral evidence of the mother

family report
ms hamilton: he was cross-examined by both counsel for the mother and the independent children’s lawyer about text messages that he had sent. he agreed, to some extent, that he had been verbally abusive in the text messages but he said that he was retaliating for messages that the mother had sent to him so that if she fired, he fired and so on. so the first question i have for you is, if the court found that he was quite focused on her messages, which aren’t produced, would that suggest to you that he is not taking ownership for his own abusive behaviours? ms j: yes. if he’s not able to articulate that his messages were abusive, even if they were retaliatory towards the mother, then there would probably be a limited insight into his own behaviour. ms hamilton: and if he described having sent those messages in hot air moments or moments of anger, does that cause you less concern or more concern or something else for the children? ms j: more concern. it would indicate that he has some difficulty of regulating his emotions, moderating his behaviour, despite feeling strong emotions to be able to act in a manner that’s not abusive to anybody. ms hamilton: and if, even after saying those things, he said that he does not have an issue with anger, what would that imply? ms j: it would contradict the previous statement that he has been abusive while angry. ms hamilton: does it suggest to you that he is, in terms of his insight into his own behaviour, still at the same point that he was when you interviewed him then? ms j: yes. ms hamilton: can you give an example of what sort of things he would need to have said to cause you to change that opinion? ms j: he would need to be able to explain how his behaviour would have impacted the mother, have some empathy for any emotions or distress that she might have felt in response to that and he would have had to have been able to explain how he would act differently the next time he felt similar sort of emotions that he was unable to manage and be able to describe the steps that he would take to address any emotions he was having difficulty with so that he was better able to moderate his behaviour.
ms hamilton: he was asked questions about what the effect on the children would be in the event that they came to live with him in melbourne and have limited time – sorry, in sydney and have limited time with their mother. he said that he did not think [x] would experience any distress at all. do you have any opinion about that? ms j: that would be highly unlikely. [x] and [y] have lived primarily with the mother and had – they’re very young children as well and had limited time with the father. and them changing to live primarily with their father would be very emotionally difficult for them to make that transition and especially to – if the mother was to remain in melbourne the lead on of less time with the mother if they lived primarily with the father in sydney. ms hamilton: what would the short, medium and long term effects be on the children’s emotional wellbeing of a transition like that? ms j: they would likely experience acute grief and loss. that would be both short, medium and long term impact on them. in the shorter term there would likely be difficulties with them regulating their emotions and they would need a very sensitive and attuned adult to assist them to co-regulate their emotions so that they were able to manage feelings of sadness or anger in a manner that wasn’t – isn’t harmful for them. they would need an adult to be able to sensitively explain the situation and if they didn’t have that they would likely to be experiencing a lot of confusion at their young ages. it would be difficult for them to understand. they would have to change all of their routines, familiar environment that they’ve been living in and that big change especially for very young children would be very, in the short term at least, very destructive to their, sort of, day to day sense of security and stability until they became accustomed to a new environment. it would also impact on changes of whatever – if they’re having pre-school or whatever the children are involved with and also grief and loss associated with a change in having regular contact with extended maternal family members that they might be having in melbourne. so all of these impacts would be seen in these children by things such as acting out behaviour, becoming very distressed and unable to calm down. sometimes children might exhibit what looks like violent behaviours. they may become withdrawn. they may regress so children can regress in their development and return to previous developmental phases and appear younger than they are, have difficulties with sleeping and eating and all of those day to day things. and long term, the impacts on them would be again the same grief and loss but also on their sense of security in the world and how relationships are formed and whether relationships are going to be able to be trusted to be sustained. and that can impact on their future formation of their own relationships as they enter adolescence and young adulthood. ms hamilton: so the father’s estimate for [y] to settle down in his care in those circumstances was a couple of weeks. you would then be saying that’s a gross underestimation of how long it would take [y] to adjust. is that right? ms j: yes.
ms hamilton: recurring in the evidence were questions about an incident in may 2020 when the father and the paternal grandmother sent flowers – no, sent chocolates, sorry, to the mother and on other occasions flowers had been sent to the mother. those things, in themselves, seem innocuous, don’t they, but do they indicate anything to you about the likelihood of coercive control or otherwise? ms j: yes. when people have separated and one party has made it clear that the relationship is over and in the circumstances where there has been an avo and the other person has not suggested that they would be interested in reconciling or similar, those kind of actions could be perceived as being quite intimidating and intrusive and disrespectful of that parent’s boundaries and decision to not continue the relationship.
ms hamilton: if she says she’s still frightened of the father but there haven’t been any further breaches since the things were sent in the mail, do you think that that’s misplaced anxiety that she might need psychological support for? ms j: it’s not necessarily misplaced anxiety, no. if a victim has been victimised by the perpetrator then it’s possible that anxiety will remain for a very long time. but, yes, psychological treatment for – to help manage that anxiety might be something that could be helpful for her.
ms hamilton: dealing with her supports in melbourne, she said she had weekly contact with her own mother and daily telephone contact with her father. her parents are, she says, amicably separated. she has some uncles that she sees once a month and she has parents that she deals with through the kindy that [x] has been attending. what would be the effect on, firstly, removing the children from that environment with those connections? ms j: as i mentioned before where they would have – leave any maternal family members, school contacts, any friends that they have, teachers, all the social capital would be removed from them and they would have to essentially start again. those kinds of changes for children can compound any grief and loss that they might experience from changing their primary carer or their established routines and – with school and anything that they might do outside of school are all – everything changes all at the same time. and for very young children that can be very de-stabilising. and similarly to what i said before, it can be expressed by, you know, things like difficult behaviours or regression in their development.
ms hamilton: and are you able to say to his honour what the likely effect on the mother would be if she had to leave melbourne and return to sydney? ms j: from what she said to me when i met her, she described that in sydney her only supports were the people in the father’s family and friends of his and that everyone she knew, family and friends, was all in melbourne. so if – unless things have changed, if she had to move to sydney i presume that she would not have those supports around her as freely available as she does in melbourne. ms hamilton: and how might that affect her if she were to remain the primary carer in sydney? ms j: she would likely feel isolated which is similar to how she describes she felt before. if she was having difficulties managing her own anxiety or any other mental health issues that might arise for her, again she doesn’t have the family or social supports that she – that might be able to help support her in melbourne. and also, in a practical sense, she wouldn’t have her own family or friends to assist her to care – you know, provide for the children or care for the children as people sometimes do rely on grandparents and similar to pick children up or drop them off and those sort of practical things. so the, sort of, day to day parenting tasks would likely be more difficult and more isolating for her in sydney based on how she described her situation in melbourne. ms hamilton: his honour hasn’t heard from the paternal grandmother, who is to give evidence tomorrow, but if that lady was to say she would be emotionally and practically supportive of the mother as primary carer, would that affect your view? ms j: no because the mother described the paternal grandmother as not emotionally supportive of her but emotionally supportive towards the father. ms hamilton: what would a move of the mother to sydney, what effect would that have, if any, on her parenting capacity? ms j: similar to before, if she felt isolated and if she felt anxious about her safety, if she felt concerned about any return to intimidating or abusive behaviour then her parenting capacity – her attention will be on those things and not on her parenting of the children, so her focus will be on safety, her focus will be on managing anxiety. and as a natural side effect to that, the focus on the children – the mother’s focus may not entirely be on the children because she’s attending to other things.
mr blackah: all right. assume he has never threatened to do that nor has he ever taken any step to act upon an abduction of children, notwithstanding that he has known where they live for more than two years, assuming those things, does the mother’s ongoing anxiety seem excessive to you? ms j: i wouldn’t say it’s excessive anxiety because anxiety can sometimes be based on situations that may never come to pass. that’s the nature of anxiety and fear. in her mind it may not be related to any actual incident of the father making a threat about abduction but i don’t think it’s an uncommon fear that people have. and if it’s in a situation of a family violence dynamic then it would not be unreasonable.
mr alexander: i take it that one of the concerns about that document, particularly that part of it which indicates that your best and safest option is to take [x], is that it involves, first of all, the separation of siblings and i wonder whether you could comment on that? [ms j]: yes. so separating siblings, particularly those which have grown up together and already have an established relationship, in this context where it’s being suggested that one parent have each child is essentially saying that one of the important relationships to the children, to [x] and [x] be sacrificed for the purposes of finalising the arrangements.
mr alexander: that is plainly, is it not, an example of family violence? [ms j]: there are several layers of threat contained within these messages that could be perceived as threats, death threats, threats to harm. and if i’m perceiving them the way that they were intended then that is an example of family violence. his honour: if you assume for the moment that the father’s response to those text messages to the mother was to the effect, “look, it was just hot air. i was just letting off steam and i was retaliating to at least verbal abuse from the mother”, would you care to comment on that if you assume that evidence was given by the father? ms j: threats to harm and death threats are not letting off steam. they are much more sinister than that. letting off steam might be where you might say, for example, that – express that you’re very angry with that person, “i hate you”, “i’ve been miserable with you”, those kinds of things might be examples of that. but making death threats or referring to harm or implying that someone has got to look over their shoulder, that they’re going to be annihilated, that is much more sinister and there’s an intent there to cause fear.
ms j: there might be situations where parents – people in intact relationships, people who have separated, who might disagree, who might get angry, slam a cupboard, say something that’s not very nice, raise their voice, there’s a difference between that and between calling derogatory names and then going so far as to make someone feel threatened about their very safety, physical and emotional. and then if – in the first example, that might be a heat of the moment example. it all happens in 20 seconds. but in this example, typing out a message takes time, longer time than it might take to speak and then typing out a long message and pressing send, there are several opportunities throughout that process where a person might have a moment to go, “is this the best thing to be sending”, “do i really want to make this threat”, “should i really say that”. there is opportunities for reflection and moderation of behaviour when someone is drafting a text message or an email for example. so to me, the heat of the moment possibility seems less likely to be heat of the moment because there have been opportunities for reflection and moderation throughout that emotional journey where someone might have been angry or upset, the way they could have said or done something different. mr alexander: and i take it, just following on with that, the conclusion that you had come to was that there’s a degree of emotional lack of regulation if you – if messages of that type are written and conveyed? ms j: emotional regulation and also ability to transfer emotion into appropriate behaviour.
ms j: yes. a parent who generally feels that way is more likely to be able to provide sensitive parenting, be able to moderate and regulate their own emotions and behaviour, be able to tolerate difficult childhood behaviour within normal realms, be able to think clearly about what their children might need and attend to their children’s needs, whether that be practical things like appointments with doctors and things or other things, like, their emotional needs. they’ve had an argument with a child at school, for example. the opposite of that, if a parent is anxious, fearful, worried, means that they would be more – just by human nature, more attentive to safety – issues of safety. and it would also potentially have a negative impact on their parenting capacity because they are unregulated themselves.
relevant legal principles  ] relocation is but one aspect of parenting. it falls to be determined in the best interests of the children. [79] recently in franklyn & franklyn [2019] famcafc 256 the full court took the opportunity to review the applicable principles in the context of the subject interim relocation appeal. the full court said at [27] – [28]:
there is an inherent tension between, on the one hand, separated parents being able to establish new homes wherever they like and, on the other, their restraint by injunction from living too far apart to avoid any impingement of their children’s ability to retain meaningful relationships with both parents. the conflict is between the best interests of the children to know and have regular personal contact with each parent and the interests of the parents to enjoy a high measure of freedom of movement which is not lost by reason only of their parental responsibility for the children (see ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 (“ams v aif”) at 196, 206, 207–208, 210). the tension at the intersection of those conflicting interests is even greater when an order is sought, not just to restrain one parent’s move further away, but to compel the parent who has already moved away to return and establish a new residence closer to the other parent. while the children’s interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii of the act (ams v aif at 207, 225, 230, u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 (“u v u”) at 282). parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children (see ams v aif at 223–224, 231– 232, sampson and hartnett (no.10) [2007] famca 1365, (2007) flc 93–350, zanda & zanda [2014] famcafc 173, (2014) flc 93–607 at [132]– [136]). only when the children’s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent’s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children’s best interests (see u v u at 262).
the best interests of the children
section 60cc considerations a) (the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents: a primary consideration) ] the reality is, in the context of this interim hearing, that the court is obliged to have regard to the maintenance and promotion of the children’s relationships with both parents. a relationship may be less than optimal but nonetheless meaningful: (godfrey & sanders [2007] famca 102 at [33]–[36], sigley & evor [2011] famcafc 22, (2011) 44 fam lr 439 at [182]). [96] in mazorski v albright [2007] famca 520, brown j considered ordinary definitions of the term “meaningful” and observed:  ] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.  ] in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92 at [121] the full court accepted as appropriate this interpretation by brown j of “meaningful relationship”.  b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
he would need to be able to explain how his behaviour would have impacted the mother, have some empathy for any emotions or distress that she might have felt in response to that and he would have had to have been able to explain how he would act differently the next time he felt similar sort of emotions that he was unable to manage and be able to describe the steps that he would take to address any emotions he was having difficulty with so that he was better able to moderate his behaviour.
in the absence of a perpetrating parent assuming responsibility for the violence, presenting as motivated to change and engaging with a specific therapeutic change program, it is likely that the family violence dynamic will continue post-separation in the future co-parenting relationship, and this is likely to undermine the victim-survivor parents’ ability to make and enforce child-focused decisions.
section 60cc(3) additional considerations a) any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views (b) the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents, and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) c) the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity, to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and to spend time with the child, and to communicate with the child ca) the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child (d) the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living e) the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with the parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis (f) the capacity of each of the child’s parents, and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs (g) the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant h) if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child: the child’s right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right i) the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family. k) if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter. l) whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child.  m) any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant.  the children, whether living with the father or with the mother in sydney (and if living with the mother, the children spending regular time with the father), would be more practically able to develop, maintain and enhance a meaningful relationship with the father.   the father would have the assistance of the paternal grandparents in caring for the children, if, for example, he was away at work, (c) the children would be best placed to develop a positive relationship with the father’s extended paternal family, including the paternal grandparents, if their residence was relocated from melbourne to sydney.   the children would be best placed to develop a positive relationship with the father’s extended paternal family, including the paternal grandparents, if their residence was relocated from melbourne to sydney.   the children are well settled in melbourne living with the mother and have significant social capital living there, including their pre-schooling, exposure to friends and the maternal extended family, and to uproot them from melbourne to live in sydney would destabilise their present position with adverse effects upon them, (b) the court infers that the mother, in circumstances where she continues to fear the father (which the court finds to be the case), feels safer living in melbourne compared to sydney, and feels, to a significant extent, shielded from the prospect of conflict with the father if she was to live in sydney, (c) the mother, in circumstances where she continues to fear the father, has exposure and related emotional comfort from her maternal extended family and friends who reside in melbourne. the mother has no such family and friends in sydney. in these circumstances, that is, living in melbourne with such support, the mother experiences reduced anxiety and stress compared to living in sydney closer to the father. the mother’s parenting capacity for the children is enhanced by remaining living in melbourne accordingly. the mother’s parenting capacity for the children would be significantly reduced were the children’s residence to be relocated to sydney by court order with the mother moving to sydney also.   the court infers that the mother, in circumstances where she
