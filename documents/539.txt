reasons for judgment
judge o’shannessy
sole parental responsibility e father]’s proposals seem to point to a need for him to remain involved by being informed about [the child]’s life events. given the ineffectiveness of the co-parenting arrangement over several years and the unlikelihood of any improvement it may be of benefit for [the child] that her primary parent make decisions. this will assist to reduce parental conflict, any opportunity for a parent to undermine the other and for timely decisions to be made for [the child] without the risk of further parental disharmony.
"major long-term issues" , in relation to a child, means issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about: (a) the child's education (both current and future), and (b) the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent. to avoid doubt, a decision by a parent of a child to form a relationship with a new partner is not, of itself, a major long-term issue in relation to the child. however, the decision will involve a major long-term issue if, for example, the relationship with the new partner involves the parent moving to another area and the move will make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with the other parent.   the child's education (both current and future), and (b) the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.   changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.
