application for costs of the substantive proceedings
financial circumstances of the parties
wife’s offers and whether there was an imprudent failure to accept
the insertion of s 117c into the legislation is a clear indication of the desire of parliament to enable parties to avoid unnecessary litigation by indicating to the other party an appropriate basis upon which the litigation can be settled. the failure to heed a reasonable offer in circumstances where there is adequate knowledge of the parties at the time the offer is made to give it proper consideration, is something to which very significant weight ought normally be given.   each offer was unambiguous, capable of acceptance and reasonable, (b) the husband failed to respond to any of the offers, and (c) the husband’s refusal of each offer was imprudent.   the husband failed to respond to any of the offers, and (c) the husband’s refusal of each offer was imprudent.   the husband’s refusal of each offer was imprudent.
the 2016 offer
at that time, no valuations had been obtained as to the value of [the business]. this offer contained some 23 pages and in particular in paragraph 14, it is submitted, contained a somewhat complicated formula as to the wife’s entitlement was to calculated and ascertained on the sale of [d company]. a sale would also cause the parties to incur a potential cgt liability, as well as the costs of sale. the husband at that time was reluctant to sell [d company], particularly as there was no formal valuation evidence and its retention had been part of his ultimate retirement plan. there had been a reference in the correspondence to the wife buying out the husband on the basis of ascribing a value of $3.1 million to the business and the husband buying out the wife at a value of $3.5 million ascribed to the business.   the formula in order 14 was an unremarkable expression of how to calculate the distribution of property in family law matters, (b) capital gains tax, and a mechanism for calculating the sum, was addressed in order 10.6, (c) the sale of the business would crystallise its value. thus, there was no reason to resist the sale of the business on the basis that there was no formal valuation evidence, and (d) the offer was unambiguous, reasonable and capable of acceptance.   capital gains tax, and a mechanism for calculating the sum, was addressed in order 10.6, (c) the sale of the business would crystallise its value. thus, there was no reason to resist the sale of the business on the basis that there was no formal valuation evidence, and (d) the offer was unambiguous, reasonable and capable of acceptance.
order 10.6, (c) the sale of the business would crystallise its value. thus, there was no reason to resist the sale of the business on the basis that there was no formal valuation evidence, and (d) the offer was unambiguous, reasonable and capable of acceptance.   the sale of the business would crystallise its value. thus, there was no reason to resist the sale of the business on the basis that there was no formal valuation evidence, and (d) the offer was unambiguous, reasonable and capable of acceptance.   the offer was unambiguous, reasonable and capable of acceptance.
the 2018 offer
the 2019 offer
conduct of the parties  this rule applies to a property case. (2) each party must make a genuine offer to settle to all other parties within:   28 days after the conciliation conference, (b) if no conciliation conference has been held – 28 days after the procedural hearing at which the case was allocated the first day before the judge, or (c) such further time as ordered by the court.   if no conciliation conference has been held – 28 days after the procedural hearing at which the case was allocated the first day before the judge, or
pursuit of a case against the wife regarding the disposition of business profit
... much of the antagonism between the parties [about the distribution of profits from the business] may have been avoided if [ms samper] had asked as she made these expenditures rather than making them unilaterally.
2017 application in a case
failure to provide proper disclosure   the trial judge did not justify an adjustment in the wife’s favour in accordance with black & kellner [1992] famca 2, (1992) flc 92-287 and weir & weir [1992] famca 69, (1993) flc 92-338, and (b) “... any failure to adequately disclose financial matters by the husband played little part in these proceedings and certainly the hearing was not prolonged as a consequence of issues concerning his non-disclosure. in fact, the hearing concluded one day early.”   “... any failure to adequately disclose financial matters by the husband played little part in these proceedings and certainly the hearing was not prolonged as a consequence of issues concerning his non-disclosure. in fact, the hearing concluded one day early.”
the husband was wholly unsuccessful   the wife would retain the business, and (b) the wife would pay the husband $1,553,005 to achieve an overall equalisation of assets.   the wife would pay the husband $1,553,005 to achieve an overall equalisation of assets.
conclusion in respect to s 117(2a) considerations
should costs be ordered on an indemnity basis?  the husband’s “failure to not only accept, but to simply not engage with, the [wife’s] repeated attempts to negotiate a compromise of the proceedings was at least imprudent”, (b) the husband ought to have known his application for less than 50 percent of the assets, and the retention of the business and related property, were “doomed to fail”, yet he maintained both positions throughout the proceedings. the wife contends that this provides a basis to presume that the husband maintained the application for an ulterior motive, and (c) the allegations as to the wife’s improper retention of company assets was tantamount to fraud without a proper foundation.   the husband ought to have known his application for less than 50 percent of the assets, and the retention of the business and related property, were “doomed to fail”, yet he maintained both positions throughout the proceedings. the wife contends that this provides a basis to presume that the husband maintained the application for an ulterior motive, and (c) the allegations as to the wife’s improper retention of company assets was tantamount to fraud without a proper foundation.   the allegations as to the wife’s improper retention of company assets was tantamount to fraud without a proper foundation.
