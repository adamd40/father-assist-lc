disclosure issues and credit
prior to being served with [mr louis’] amended response e-filed on 9 december 2021, i was unaware of any liability in relation to any contract or other dealings with [mr p] (“[mr p]”) and [mr p] has never contacted me regarding any alleged debt. it would seem from the order sought by [mr louis] in his amended response e-filed on 9 december 2021 that [mr louis] alleges that myself and [company b] owe [mr p] the sum of aud$10,000. [mr louis] alleges that such claim exists in relation to the venture to open [r] restaurant. i have not been provided with any documentation in relation to this alleged claim from [mr p] or [mr louis] and to the best of my knowledge and belief, there was no outstanding fees owing to [mr p].
the wife conceded during the course of cross-examination that she had been aware that mr p was claiming he was owed monies. the wife’s oral evidence was that the sum alleged is “rubbery” and she has not received documents that justify to her satisfaction the monies alleged to be owed. i find that the wife was aware of the assertion by mr p that he was owed monies and her affidavit evidence was misleading on this subject matter.

...when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion — usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.
