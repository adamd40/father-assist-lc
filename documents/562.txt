the evidence
i observed [mr berys] go into a rage and he was very red in the face. he then pushed the lampshade into the blinds, making a loud bang.
don't push my buttons any further and you won't have that baby you are carrying, i will have you and the baby dead and put a bullet in your head. this is your entire fault, you deserved what happened.
the mother says that x witnessed and heard all of this and that when x said to the father "don't upset mummy" and the father responded to x: "stop crying x this is your mummy's entire fault." the mother says that x was very upset and that after the father left the room, x said to the mother words the effect of:
i will be a good girl. stop crying. i want to be good.
i was in a bad mood. i was trying to give up smoking and was under the effects of withdrawal. i had been a smoker for a long time. i asked [ms berys] to help me sweep up the glass...i regret my actions.
if we separate, i will make your life hell and you know if i kill you, i will be better off in jail. at least i won't have any stress from work or home
and:
how do you want to split up the children? one for you and one for me?
my right-hand clipped [ms berys's] hand. i did not intend to make contact or hurt her.
i don't feel safe staying here with [mr berys].
also as you know i came from a broken and violent childhood...not that it is an excuse for the way i vent my frustrations but as i have seen violence and been part of violence my perception is a lot different to your perception, for this i apologies [sic] profusely and i had not realise [sic] this until now. the way i display frustration to me is just venting albeit it to you it would come across as violent, i sincerely understand this now which is why i have been begging you to give our family just one chance so i can demonstrate to you i can turn this into a positive outcome for us all, we all deserve a second chance, like i have given you in the past.  and [y] played shops together, while [mr berys] appeared to look for something. [mr berys] asked in what seemed a frustrated tone where a charger was for a remote -controlled car. they said they didn't know, and [mr berys] said, "the charger is missing throw everything in the bin" [x] responded in a concerned tone, "no".   demonstrated to her father how the beyblades worked. [mr berys] put down the communication book and asked [x] for the beyblade, she didn't respond and gave it to [y]. [mr berys] threw rubbish papers in the direction of the girls, in what appeared to be angry manner. [x] asked in a surprised tone, "why did you do that?" and he said, "because i asked for it and you gave it to [y] ". [mr berys] walked out of the room and the girls continued to play quietly.   had one-on-one counselling through t families counselling and mediation weekly from 22 august 2018 to 10 october 2018, (b) completed the new families post separation parenting program and received a certificate of completion, (c) completed the triple p online course in positive parenting (consisting of eight modules) on 22 may 2019 and received a certificate of completion, and (d) completed the circle of security parenting course with an family centre over eight weeks and received a certificate of completion dated 3 december 2020.   completed the new families post separation parenting program and received a certificate of completion, (c) completed the triple p online course in positive parenting (consisting of eight modules) on 22 may 2019 and received a certificate of completion, and (d) completed the circle of security parenting course with an family centre over eight weeks and received a certificate of completion dated 3 december 2020.   completed the triple p online course in positive parenting (consisting of eight modules) on 22 may 2019 and received a certificate of completion, and (d) completed the circle of security parenting course with an family centre over eight weeks and received a certificate of completion dated 3 december 2020.   completed the circle of security parenting course with an family centre over eight weeks and received a certificate of completion dated 3 december 2020.
...that [mr berys] might lose his temper with the children and verbally and/or physically abuse them, is a very real one and the most compelling in this matter. to ameliorate both these risks, [mr berys] should complete a comprehensive anger management course that focuses on accepting responsibility for his behaviour, acknowledging the impact of his anger on others and committing to sustained and positive change in the future.
when you enter the course they assess you for two or three sessions. then the counsellor said that he didn't think i had an anger issue and provided counselling for emotional stress on a one-on-one basis.
there was an instance where he's disappeared with our daughter, and when i didn't want to move and he said he'd move and take our daughters without me.
the family report and ms m's evidence ] the father denied that he was routinely physically and verbally abusive towards the mother but he agreed that there is some factual basis to the allegations, for example, he did punch a wall once in anger ("but not in front of the children"), and he did break the glass coffee table ("in a moment of frustration"). he emphatically denied ever punching or hitting the mother or grabbing her by the throat. he said that the only time he ever touched her was when they argued at the point of separation, "and she pushed me in the back and instinctively i swung around and brushed against her. then she rang the police and immediately changed her persona and became hysterical.” [16] if the father behaved towards the mother as she has alleged, and the children witnessed this behaviour (which she has also alleged) that may have been potentially emotionally harmed. they were also at risk of physical harm. in the future, if the father has poor impulse control and low frustration tolerance, the children are at risk of physical and emotional harm if they do or say anything that triggers this type of behaviour. [20] the mother said that she knows the children genuinely love their father and enjoy spending time with him but she believes if the requirement for supervision is lifted, there is a high risk that he will denigrate her and her family to the children and be punitive in the way he manages their behaviours. she said that her greatest fear, however, is that he will seek to use the children against her in order to punish her for leaving him and this could include kidnapping the children and and/or or otherwise deliberately harming them. [21] observations of the children with their father indicated that they have no fear of him and they enjoy his company. their interactions were warm and affectionate. however, in her interview [x] spoke of having memories of the father being "mean" and "bad" and that she was "scared of him" when they all lived together ("but not now!"). these recollections appeared to be genuinely her own, she used age-appropriate phrasing and her emotional state was congruent with what she described as having occurred. [22] the mother's narrative of the family violence issues was coherent and credible and she did not, in the report writer's view, seek to amplify or exaggerate the risk issues. [23] the father presented himself as a man who has been the victim of a system that believes mothers and persecutes fathers. while saying that he had no desire to denigrate the mother, he nonetheless spent a considerable amount of time doing just that, particularly by calling into question her parenting capacity (confidently viewing himself as the much more capable parent) and also what he believes to be her vulnerability to being manipulated by her family and her lack of agency/autonomy in this respect.  ] [mr berys] said that when he was in his 20s "i had a very short tolerance (sic) - i showed my frustration easily then, but with [mr berys] i was much more tolerant. i would think before i acted, much more!" [mr berys] said that in the last couple of years of his relationship with [ms berys], he was continually trying to give up smoking "and so i was having lots of withdrawal symptoms and i was getting a bit more grumpy. but that's no excuse for losing or cool.”  ] ...i don't have an anger problem. i'm 63 years old and i've learned how to manage my anger. yes, i did things in frustration that weren’t okay. but i would never do anything to harm [ms berys] or the children. that's not me. i'm a person of integrity (original emphasis).  ] [ms berys] said that around the middle of 2016 she was so worried about what was happening that she approached [mr berys] and suggested that he might benefit from seeing a counsellor. “but he told me that he didn't have a problem, it was me with the problem and that i needed to find a counsellor who would help me become more supportive of him. so that's why i decided to go to counselling (in december 2016)." [62] in relation to the children's time with their father, [ms berys] said that, "they seem to have fun with their visits. i gee them up to look forward to it and it does sound like they're very positive."  ] the report writer asked [x] what she remembers from when her parents were together. she said, "daddy was mean to mummy. that's why they don't live together anymore." [x] was asked what she meant by "mean." she said, "daddy punched the wall and he made holes! and he punched mummy here (indicating her chest) and once he hit her hand he and he made it bleed." the report writer did some feelings exploration with [x]. she said that, "i was sad. i didn't like it (the latter was said in a quiet tone of voice, looking down). i didn't like it when daddy put his hands around mummy's throat like this (demonstrates)." [76] [x] then said quickly, "but i'm not scared of daddy anymore! we have fun and he's nice! we play at the park and he brings me things. he doesn't say bad things (anymore). i like daddy."  ] when the report writer announced it was time to pack up, [x] did everything possible to distract and divert from this eventuality. she began acting in a silly manner, echoing what her father was saying. [mr berys] gave calm instructions about picking up the toys and while [y] said "more! more!" both girls eventually decided to help their father.  ] the children were observed informally with their mother over the course of the day. they delighted in her attention and were affectionate and loving towards her. [85] ...there were concerning elements in [mr berys'] narrative and in his reflections about his relationship with [ms berys]. in particular, while he admitted that he did behave aggressively at times, in doing so, [mr berys] sought to minimise the extent of this behaviour and the impact it would have had on those around him. [mr berys] characterised his aggressive actions as being done "in frustration" rather than "in anger" which suggests that he views his behaviour as a (regrettable) response to external provocation rather than as a result of poor impulse control.  ] [mr berys] expressed the view that while he used to have anger issues in his younger years, these are well behind him now...the report writer's view, however, is that [mr berys] lacks insight into the extent of his anger management issues and it is more comfortable and less confronting or challenging for him to view his angry outbursts as simply isolated incidents where he became overly frustrated. [88] it is not unusual for men who perpetrate violence against women to convince them that they are the problem and if only they could modify their behaviour, the violence would stop. [90] [mr berys] approach to parenting appears to be an authoritarian one (which he characterised as "tough love"). while authoritative parenting - applying boundaries and limitations with clearly defined expectations in a firm and consistent manner, while remaining emotionally attuned to a child's feelings and being warm and responsive - is probably what [mr berys] thinks that he was doing with the girls, it is more likely that someone with low frustration tolerance, poor impulse control and a need to control others, will parent children in a more extreme version, which relies on the child doing exactly as the parent expects or suffering the consequences. in these circumstances, the child learns to modify their behaviour through fear rather than an internally integrated understanding of the inherent value of behaving well. [91] it was evident, however, that the children have benefited from being able to spend regular, weekly time with their father for the past 12 months. x was very clear that she experiences her father very differently now than when her parents were together. this is likely to be in large part due to the fact that the visits have been supervised, for structured and limited periods of time, and this has allowed [mr berys] to re-engage and emotionally connect with his children through play. [92] it is understandable that [mr berys] wants the children's time with their father to remain supervised. her specific fears about moving to unsupervised time - that [mr berys] will denigrate her to the children, and that he will lose his temper with one or both of them like he used to with her and lash out verbally and/or physically at them, are in the report writer's opinion, valid fears based on the material before the court and the parties presentation and narrative...in this matter, [mr berys] appears to be so convinced of his superiority as a parent that he would not seek to contain his feelings about [ms berys] and her approach to parenting, and this is likely to cause the children considerable confusion and possibly distress, unless it is adequately addressed.  ] the other risk, that [mr berys] might lose his temper with the children and verbally and/or physically abuse them, is a very real one and the most compelling in this matter. to ameliorate both these risks, [mr berys] should complete a comprehensive anger management course that focuses on accepting responsibility for his behaviour, acknowledging the impact of his anger on others and committing to sustained and positive change in the future. [mr berys] should also complete the circle of security parenting course, as well as another parenting course aimed at parents of children aged 8 years and under. [94] [ms berys'] 'worst case' scenario, that [mr berys] might retain the children and seek to inflict harm on them as retribution on her, is understandable in a generic sense but in the report writer's view, while the risk can never be ruled out entirely, in this matter there is no material before the court, nor anything in the father's presentation, narrative or past/current behaviours, which would suggest an unacceptable risk of harm of the type [mr berys] fears.   the mother have sole parental responsibility for the children, (b) the children live with their mother, (c) the father undertake and complete the "taking responsibility" course run by c counsellors, the “circle of security” course, the “123 magic and emotion coaching” course and the “bringing up great kids” course, (d) until the father has completed the recommended anger management and other courses, the children spend time with their father each saturday from 1:00am until 4:00pm supervised with changeovers at f contact centre at suburb g, (e) for time to be unsupervised once the father has completed the recommended courses, and (f) thereafter, the parties attend a further mediation to determine when overnight time between the children the father would commence, with any such time to be phased in incrementally over a period of at least 12 months and subject to quarterly review by the mediator.   the children live with their mother, (c) the father undertake and complete the "taking responsibility" course run by c counsellors, the “circle of security” course, the “123 magic and emotion coaching” course and the “bringing up great kids” course, (d) until the father has completed the recommended anger management and other courses, the children spend time with their father each saturday from 1:00am until 4:00pm supervised with changeovers at f contact centre at suburb g, (e) for time to be unsupervised once the father has completed the recommended courses, and (f) thereafter, the parties attend a further mediation to determine when overnight time between the children the father would commence, with any such time to be phased in incrementally over a period of at least 12 months and subject to quarterly review by the mediator.   the father undertake and complete the "taking responsibility" course run by c counsellors, the “circle of security” course, the “123 magic and emotion coaching” course and the “bringing up great kids” course, (d) until the father has completed the recommended anger management and other courses, the children spend time with their father each saturday from 1:00am until 4:00pm supervised with changeovers at f contact centre at suburb g, (e) for time to be unsupervised once the father has completed the recommended courses, and (f) thereafter, the parties attend a further mediation to determine when overnight time between the children the father would commence, with any such time to be phased in incrementally over a period of at least 12 months and subject to quarterly review by the mediator.   until the father has completed the recommended anger management and other courses, the children spend time with their father each saturday from 1:00am until 4:00pm supervised with changeovers at f contact centre at suburb g, (e) for time to be unsupervised once the father has completed the recommended courses, and (f) thereafter, the parties attend a further mediation to determine when overnight time between the children the father would commence, with any such time to be phased in incrementally over a period of at least 12 months and subject to quarterly review by the mediator.   for time to be unsupervised once the father has completed the recommended courses, and (f) thereafter, the parties attend a further mediation to determine when overnight time between the children the father would commence, with any such time to be phased in incrementally over a period of at least 12 months and subject to quarterly review by the mediator.   thereafter, the parties attend a further mediation to determine when overnight time between the children the father would commence, with any such time to be phased in incrementally over a period of at least 12 months and subject to quarterly review by the mediator.

[23] no doubt there will be some cases in which the court is able to come to a positive finding that the allegation is well-founded. in all but the most extraordinary cases, that finding will have a decisive impact on the order to be made respecting custody and access. there will be cases also in which the court has no hesitation in rejecting the allegation as groundless ... [24] in resolving the wider issue the court must determine whether on the evidence there is a risk of sexual abuse occurring if custody or access be granted and assessing the magnitude of that risk. after all, in deciding what is in the best interests of a child, the family court is frequently called upon to assess and evaluate the likelihood or possibility of events or occurrences which, if they come about, will have a detrimental impact on the child's welfare. the existence and magnitude of the risk of sexual abuse, as with other risks of harm to the welfare of a child, is a fundamental matter to be taken into account in deciding issues of custody and access. in access cases, the magnitude of the risk may be less if the order in contemplation is supervised access ... [25] ... in devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. to achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse.  1] ... we accept as a matter of practice, a trial judge will almost inevitably be required in a case where sexual abuse allegations are raised to consider whether abuse has been proven on the balance of probabilities as well as considering whether or not an unacceptable risk of abuse exists ...  ] in his recent paper entitled ‘unacceptable risk – a return to basics’ the hon. john fogarty a.m. set out his summary of the principles emerging from m and m as follows:
1 the decisive issue is and always remains the best interests of that child. all other issues are subservient. 2 the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable. 3 where past abuse of a child is alleged it is usually neither necessary nor desirable to reach a definitive conclusion on that issue. where, however, that is done the briginshaw civil standard of proof applies. 4 the circumstance, if it be so, that the allegation of past abuse is not proved in accordance with briginshaw, does not impede reliance upon those circumstances in determining whether there is an unacceptable risk. 5 the concentration in these cases should normally be upon the question whether there is an unacceptable risk to the child. 6 the onus of proof in reaching that conclusion is the ordinary civil standard. 7 but the components which go to make up that conclusion need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of unacceptable risk from the accumulation of factors, none or some only of which, are proved to that standard.
and thereafter expanded some points contained in the summary.  ] frequently, (i would respectfully venture, too frequently) “risk” is referred to as an all-embracing term, a “general” finding of which can (purportedly) be seen to have some form of “ipso facto consequences” for the orders made. yet, “risk” is, without more, but a convenient description, orders must, surely, address its constituent components which must, axiomatically, vary according to the circumstances of each case. [72] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said:
risk assessment in any situation involves, in essence, the asking of the following questions: (1) what harmful outcome is potentially present in this situation? (2) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (3) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (4) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (5) what measures are available whose deployment could mitigate the risks that are probable? (b. mahendra, 'psychiatric risk assessment in family and child law' (2008) 38 family law 569).  ] mr fogarty, writing in the australian journal of family law said this (20 ajfl 249 at 254-5):
... the reality is that all courts deal with issues of "risk" and degrees of risk (however described) in various situations and that concept is increasingly used in legislation. risk is difficult to define in a way which is not ultimately circular. but it is an inevitable part of life at all its levels. it is inherently risky to breathe, eat, drink, walk, drive, work, invest and play. the world is full of different risks and consequences and everyone is prone to dangers. we confront varying levels of risk everyday. people frequently face potentially dangerous situations, not many live at home in complete isolation to avoid getting in harms way. most people try to avoid what they perceive to be risk, some willingly take on high risk activities. risk involves two component, the degree of "likelihood" of the happening of an event, and the possible consequences (good or bad) if it does [cases and citations omitted]. individuals in their assessment of some risks may focus more on one than the other of these components. but at some point it usually becomes necessary for that person to make a judgment of the risk and whether it can/should be taken. where the risk relates to a third person to whom one owes a responsibility, it is likely in the nature of things that the estimate will be conservative. risks are relative and usually involve trade-offs. crossing the road with oncoming traffic to catch the last connection to the airport involves the risk of being hit by a car or the risk of missing the plane. very much a balancing exercise of facts, experience and intuition, but essentially which risk carries the greater detriment (usually the car). then there is the common experience of a mother watching her child cross a road to go to school. the risk is seen as greater (although it may not be) because the consequences may be death or injury to the child and because the responsibilities of the mother will be seen by her as greater than for herself or another adult .... at times the courts and the legislature have attempted to give an indication of the content or quality of the risk -- otherwise “risk” may mean any risk, however small or unlikely. hence the use of adjectives such as “serious”, “grave”, “real”, “appreciable” and “unacceptable”.  ] i respectfully agree, as i also do with mr fogarty's statement (which also has echoes in the english author's statement earlier quoted) that:
... unacceptable risk in the high court's formulation [in m v m (1988) 166 clr 69] requires two separate steps. is there a risk, and is it unacceptable? the concentration by the high court is upon both the nature and the degree of risk in the particular case. its formulation is all about balance. in some cases a risk is "acceptable" when balanced against other factors and other orders. the object of safeguards is to convert an unacceptable situation to an acceptable one where that is feasible and is of "benefit to the child". it is, as i suggested earlier, calibrated to its use in individual cases. it is unrelated to the exoneration or otherwise of the alleged abuser, it is all about the bests interests of the child and protection from risk
the primary considerations ] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitative one. quantitative concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[7]  ] the act sets out in s 60cc several matters for the court to consider in determining what is in the child’s best interests but does not seek to mandate that any one or other matter becomes determinative in any particular case. for the purposes of this case the legislation requires that there be a primary consideration given to the benefit of the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents but it does not purport to prescribe how that meaningful relationship is best promoted in the circumstances of any one case.
and later, at paragraph 36 said:  ] it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.  0] to be a meaningful relationship, it must be healthy, worthwhile and advantageous to the child...those adjectives mean that children need their parents to lead by example about self-discipline. children need to learn to develop the ability to relate to others. they need to learn about the privileges and responsibility which will devolve upon them as parents. those are fundamental parts of the meaningful relationship.
section 60cc(3) - the additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as the children’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the children’s views.
the nature of the relationship of the children with each of their parents.
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the children, to spend time with the children, and to communicate with the children.
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parents obligation to maintain the children.
the likely effect of any change in the children circumstances, including the likely effect on the children of any separation from either of the parents.  an increase of three hours a fortnight on the mother’s proposal, (b) a significant increase progressing to overnight time of friday to sunday each alternate weekend and half of the school holidays on the icl’s proposed orders, and (c) a significant increase progressing to overnight time on thursday until monday each alternative weekend and half of the school holidays on the father’s proposed orders.   a significant increase progressing to overnight time of friday to sunday each alternate weekend and half of the school holidays on the icl’s proposed orders, and (c) a significant increase progressing to overnight time on thursday until monday each alternative weekend and half of the school holidays on the father’s proposed orders.   a significant increase progressing to overnight time on thursday until monday each alternative weekend and half of the school holidays on the father’s proposed orders.
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with their father and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the children’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both of their parents on a regular basis, and in particular in this matter, with the father.
the capacity of each of the children’s parents to provide for the needs of the children, including emotional and intellectual needs.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of the children’s parents, and any other characteristics of the children that the court thinks are relevant.
the attitude to the children, and the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the children’s parents.
any family violence involving the children or a member of the children’s family.
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the children or a member of the children’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter.
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the children.  each thursday 3:00pm until 6:30pm and alternate sundays from 10:00am until 3:00pm in the presence of a person already known to the children and approved by the mother, to (b) the same amount of time but not required to be within the presence of another adult, and then (c) requiring the parties to engage in family dispute resolution with an fdr practitioner “to discuss further parenting arrangements for the children with a view to entering a parenting plan or making an application for consent orders to vary these [final orders]”. in the absence of agreement between the parties, there would be no parenting plan and no application for consent orders, but the father would be left with the time provided in the orders and the matter would almost certainly return to court.   the same amount of time but not required to be within the presence of another adult, and then (c) requiring the parties to engage in family dispute resolution with an fdr practitioner “to discuss further parenting arrangements for the children with a view to entering a parenting plan or making an application for consent orders to vary these [final orders]”. in the absence of agreement between the parties, there would be no parenting plan and no application for consent orders, but the father would be left with the time provided in the orders and the matter would almost certainly return to court.   requiring the parties to engage in family dispute resolution with an fdr practitioner “to discuss further parenting arrangements for the children with a view to entering a parenting plan or making an application for consent orders to vary these [final orders]”. in the absence of agreement between the parties, there would be no parenting plan and no application for consent orders, but the father would be left with the time provided in the orders and the matter would almost certainly return to court.
