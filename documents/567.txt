you are telling me now after over four years that the interest i applied was not legal....you have not paid a cent yet and now you are telling me it was illegal. anyhow i am prepared to reduce the interest rate to match a bank’s personal loan rate which i have attached to this email the new interest rate is 11.99% per annum. the correct (legal) new rate will apply from the day i made the first transfer and you will stop being charged interest once you finish paying off the amount. as you recall the total loan amount was $60,000 add to that 11.99% interest this brings up the loan amount to $88,776 if the total was paid this year. i will continue to charge interest and will take legal action if you try and get out of paying the loan.
