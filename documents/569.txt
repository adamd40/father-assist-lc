(2) whether there is a likelihood of orders being varied in a significant way as a result of a new hearing. (3) if there is such a likelihood, the nature of the likely changes must be weighed against the potential detriment to the child or children caused by the litigation itself. thus, for example, small changes may not have sufficient benefit to compensate for the disruption caused by significant re-litigation.   whether there is a likelihood of orders being varied in a significant way as a result of a new hearing.
