second respondent marries mr ac, she and the husband have a falling-out:  george], at paragraph 17, that’s 1-7 on page 4, you give evidence about [mr ferguson] often being very opinionated on other people’s decisions. do you see that? ---yes. and whether he agreed with them. this has made your relationship with [mr ferguson] difficult at times and has affected his relationship with his children, siblings and extended family. do you see that? --- yes. and at paragraph 107, which is on page 13...do you see that? --- yes. you say that from 2009 until 2016, you didn’t speak to [mr ferguson] following your resignation from the company. he did not agree with my decision to stop working with them and therefore did not speak to me. do you see that? --- that’s correct. so would you agree with me that [mr ferguson] was a person who didn’t hold back his opinions? ---no. that’s right. was forthright? --- that’s right. and he could be a dominant person, couldn’t he? --- i suppose you can say that. and he wasn’t a person that you could stand up to easily, was he? --- no, i wouldn’t say that. well...he didn’t agree with your decision in 2009 to resign from the company, you would agree? --- that’s correct. and you made a decision contrary to his wishes? --- that’s correct. and as a consequence, there was no communication for seven years between you and your father? --- that’s correct. and that was because he had made the decision not to speak to you any further, did he? --- it was probably a mutual decision because i was standing up to my dad. (my emphasis)
the marriage breaks down:
we appreciate that, given the length of time since the transaction occurred, you will likely no longer hold the file – although if you do have any documents relating to the transaction, would you kindly forward copies to us. notwithstanding, we would appreciate it if you would be able to telephone the writer to discuss your recollection of the transaction and, in particular, the circumstances surrounding the consideration for the transfer.[10]
“our clients have also expressed concerns to us about the use of their funds by you over a lengthy period of time and we are seeking further instructions in this regard.”
“we anticipate our clients will seek further advice in relation to the possibility of having the unit transferred back to them for your failure to comply with the terms of the deed.”
“it was mutually agreed at the time, since i was in an unstable relationship, that to protect my asset for the future benefit of my own children, we would establish an enduring loan agreement to be called in the event that my partner at that time or any future partner made any claims to the property, thus ensuring no benefit of the property could be taken from me. neither of my brothers were required to enter into any such agreement as they were both married and in secure relationships. i have been married now for 10 years and my home life and relationships are quite stable so i fail to understand why this deed is being called for satisfaction. hence the reason i am perplexed with these actions and the obvious consequences when he should remember the obvious motivation behind the enduring loan agreement in the first place. it was not intended to be called at a whim or what seems to be mischief on his part just to make my life difficult for whatever reason that is not apparent to me. i am not in any position to satisfy this demand to pay $280,000 within 28 days and have no intention of doing so. it was a gift, in the same way as is [sic] was for all the siblings.” [14]
“i am somewhat bewildered at the provocation of my father’s actions in this instance. there have been no “issues” whatever either in the past or recently that would give rise to concerns that my father and his wife have exclusive and unfettered occupation of the premises situated a [b street, town c]. this has never been in question. my father’s naturally suspicious nature prompted the ownership structure and he did not wish my brothers to have access to the property at any time, particularly prior to he and [ms ferguson’s] deaths where they could have them evicted and the property sold. he decided that the purchase of the property in my name would ensure they always had a place to live and the property would then become my inheritance when they eventually died. i have done or said nothing that would give them cause to feel this arrangement would as likely change. i would certainly not be prepared to sign transfer of title to my father whilst i have questions regarding his mental capacity.” (my emphasis)
analysis of the debt claim for $280,000:
the wife’s section 106b claim:
section 106b transactions to defeat claims 106b(1) in proceedings under this act, the court may set aside or restrain the making of an instrument or disposition by or on behalf of, or by direction and in the interest of, a party, which is made or proposed to be made to defeat an existing or anticipated order in those proceedings or which, irrespective of intention, is likely to defeat any such order. ... 106b(3) the court must have regard to the interests of, and shall make any order proper for the protection of, a bona fide purchaser or other person interested. 106b(4) a party or a person acting on collusion with a party may be ordered to pay the costs of any other party or of a bona fide purchaser or other person interested of and incidental to any such instrument or disposition and the setting aside or restraining of the instrument or disposition. ... 106b(5) in this section: disposition includes: (a) a sale or gift...
jurisdictional elements of section 106b(1)
“proceedings under this act”:
“the making of an instrument or disposition”:
“by or on behalf of, or by direction and in the interest of, a party”:
“which is made or proposed to be made to defeat an existing or anticipated order in those proceedings or which, irrespective of intention, is likely to defeat any such order”:
in the instant matter before me, it is not a question of whether the husband expected or foresaw a subsequent property application by the wife and “anticipated” an order being made, but whether considering all of the circumstances at the time of the disposition such an application by her at some time, with a consequent order, was objectively to be foreseen or to be expected by him as being likely or reasonably probable.
his honour’s reasoning was that:
as in the law of torts, i consider that the elements of expectation or foreseeability in an ‘anticipated order’ must be considered on an objective rather than a subjective basis – to hold otherwise would be to favour the determinedly ignorant or the blissfully unaware, ‘anticipated’ as used in sec. 85 is an adjective, not a verb. it is therefore descriptive of the order referred to. it requires the order to have the quality of being ‘anticipated’. by whom? the law’s answer must be by a reasonable disponer, at the time of the disposition, properly considering all of the circumstances of the case. [16]
where there is an existing order, the disponer is aware of its nature and content. there is a good deal to be said for the view, that “an anticipated order” is one of a kind and relating to matters which, at least on an objective test, a reasonable disponer would have in contemplation or foresee when the disposition is made.[17] (my emphasis)
in proceedings under the act in which it is sought to set aside a transaction on the ground that the instrument or disposition in question which is made or proposed to be made, the court may set aside that transaction if it is satisfied that it is likely to defeat an existing or anticipated order, irrespective of the intention of the disponer. of course if there was established an actual intent to defeat an existing or anticipated order that would be the end of the matter. (my emphasis)  ] fundamental to the wife’s claims was her assertion that, despite the subsistence of the parties’ relationship for over two years subsequent to the transactions, the marriage had been unhappy since [2 or 3 years earlier]. that assertion was denied by the husband. the resolution of that issue was central to the wife’s s 106b case. that case turned on her assertion that the husband alienated property interests to members of his family in anticipation of the proceedings for property settlement, and orders within those proceeding, with the intention of defeating any claim she may have or, irrespective of that intention, which had that effect. [69] ... the wife apparently asserted within that claim an intention on the part of the husband, and perhaps members of his family acting in conjunction with him, to defeat what she asserted was an anticipated s 79 order. however, it was not necessary for her to prove that intention, it was sufficient if the impugned transactions had that effect. while the wife confronted, on the s 106b case she apparently sought to adduce, forensic difficulties in proving the husband’s intention behind the impugned transactions, her claim did not depend upon the same. however, her claim would fail if she could not prove that, irrespective of any such intention, the impugned transactions were made in anticipation of relevant orders in her favour. [82] as we have said, the wife did not need to prove any intention on the part of the husband to sustain her s 106b claim, much less any fraudulent intention. she did, though, need to prove that orders in relevant proceedings were “anticipated” notwithstanding the time gap between the impugned transactions and separation...

joint assets
exercising the discretion in section 106b
is not a provision which enables a party long after the event to upset past transactions because the present funds or resources of the respondent turn out to be insufficient. such an interpretation would mean that any transaction made at the time by the respondent could subsequently be set aside if at any future time the assets of the respondent were insufficient to meet the demands of an order. a more reasonable interpretation is that the disposition must be shown to have the direct effect or the likely direct effect of defeating an existing or anticipated order in the sense that if the disposition had not taken place the order would have been effective.
