the competing proposals of the parties  within forty days from the date of these orders the husband pay to the wife the amount of sixty thousand dollars ($60,000). [2] that:  1] in accordance with section 90xt(1)(a) of the family law act 1975, whenever a splittable payment becomes payable to the husband from his interest in the [super fund c], the wife is entitled to be paid an amount calculated in accordance with part 6 of the family law (superannuation) regulations 2001 using the base amount of $23,713 and there is a corresponding reduction in the entitlement the husband would have but for these orders. [2.2] having been afforded procedural fairness in relation to the making of the orders, the orders bind the trustee of the [super fund c]. [2.3] the trustee of the [super fund c] do all things necessary to give effect of order (2.1) hereof within twenty-eight days (28) of the date provided by such order to rollover the sum to be split in the wife’s favour to the superannuation fund as nominated by the wife. [2.4] the solicitor for the wife serve a copy of these orders on the trustee of [super fund c] within twenty-eight days (28) of the date of these orders and thereafter the aforesaid trustee has liberty to relist the matter in the event that the trustee is unable to comply with order (2.1) hereof.  that as between the husband and the wife, and subject to the orders above, the husband and the wife shall each respectively retain all interest and entitlement to:  1] all real property registered in their name, [3.2] all personal property now in his/her respective possession or control, [3.3] any motor vehicle in their possession, [3.4] all savings and investments in their sole name, [3.5] all shares, debentures, units in unit trusts, bank, building society or credit union accounts standing in his/her sole name respectively, [3.6] all interests in life insurance policies and superannuation funding in his/her sole name respectively.
evidence as to credit
the wife’s evidence should be the preferred evidence to be accepted. it is also noteworthy to emphasise that the wife’s evidence went unchallenged and was not cross-examined by the respondent husband’s counsel ... it is submitted that the best evidence is that given by the wife.
... it is not the case that the evidence of that witness on that topic must be accepted on the ground that it is unchallenged.
... at times appeared to demonstrate a greater level of subjectivity and was vague in his recollection when questions were put to him about the wife’s contributions. it is submitted he answered questions in the vein of gaining a better position and more favourable outcome to his case.
“i am not sure what it was for” “yes, it was for electricity” “i cannot tell” “i don’t see my account number here” “i don’t know” “could have been”.
so the wife is contributing to board and to other costs?”
the husband answered:
she was paying towards the costs.
the evidence
prior to the commencement of [ms bilic] living with [mr bilic], [mr bilic] and i had reduced the mortgage considerably and it was approximately $134,000.
... contributing ... [to] the mortgage repayments.[3]
i also contributed to other expenses including council rates, water rates, electricity, food, new furniture, telephone bills, etc. i contributed to the cost of new appliances such as the dryer, fridge, tv and oven.
your wife also made other contributions to household expenses.
during the marriage i pay for all the financial expenses including the mortgage payments, utilities, rates, day-to-day living expenses, our outgoing expenses and holiday expenses.
all payments are made electronically so a record could be kept of the transactions. all payments were made to my savings account.
and his concessions in cross-examination, i find the sense of both paragraph 20 of his affidavit and his initial responses in cross-examination can be made in the sense that the payments were made by him, though monies were contributed thereto by the wife by transfers to his account from which those payments are made.
... would also assist with house work, grocery shopping, cooking, etc.[4]
... made very minimal if any contribution to the house work as my mum was home all day and would take care of everything including cooking, cleaning, ironing, shopping, washing. also on the weekend [ms bilic] and i would both assist with the housework.[5]   bilic] did not contribute to the housework. she would always complain she was tired and stay in her room. [ms bilic] would occasionally help with the cooking, she would bake a cake if there was a party. i would cook for everyone and do all the cleaning, washing and ironing in the house, as i was always home and like to keep myself busy. i used to pack lunch for [ms bilic] for her to take to work when she started working.
... she did some cleaning, my son did some cleaning, and i did some. she went shopping sometimes, and sometimes i did.
... she sometimes washed, but i did the ironing, she sometimes ironed, my son asked her a few times to help.
the wife contributed to the household expenses from her money?
to which the second respondent replied:
yes, she did some, yes.
submissions  by making payments totalling $35,400 into the husband savings account from which the repayments of the home loan account were made, (2) by her transfers to the husband’s account of monies towards paying strata fees, council rates, water rates, electricity bills and other accounts, and (3) by her contribution of one third of the purchase price of new appliances such as the dryer, refrigerator, television and oven (or all retained by the husband and second respondent except for the dryer, which the husband said in his cross-examination was “gone’), were “a major contribution as they contributed to the reduction of the mortgage significantly.”   by her transfers to the husband’s account of monies towards paying strata fees, council rates, water rates, electricity bills and other accounts, and (3) by her contribution of one third of the purchase price of new appliances such as the dryer, refrigerator, television and oven (or all retained by the husband and second respondent except for the dryer, which the husband said in his cross-examination was “gone’), were “a major contribution as they contributed to the reduction of the mortgage significantly.”   by her contribution of one third of the purchase price of new appliances such as the dryer, refrigerator, television and oven (or all retained by the husband and second respondent except for the dryer, which the husband said in his cross-examination was “gone’), were “a major contribution as they contributed to the reduction of the mortgage significantly.”

... general, and at times appeared to demonstrate a greater level of subjectivity and was vague in his recollection when questions were put to him about the wife’s contributions. it is submitted he answered questions in the vein of gaining a better position and more favourable outcome to his case.
... the wife provided a greater degree of particularity in comparison to the husband’s blanket denials of contributions by the wife.
... the wife’s car should not be taken into consideration as part of the property pool as it was acquired post separation.[9]  ] ... earlier cases often contain reference to particular property being “excluded” from consideration. in our view it is wrong as a matter of principle to refer to any existing legal or equitable interests in property of the parties or either of them as “excluded” from, or “immune” from, consideration in applications for orders pursuant to s79. again, what was said by the eye court in stanford pertains. ... [31] ... the nature of a particular interest or interests in property and when and how it was acquired, utilised, improved or preserved may be very relevant to each or all of 3 central questions: should a s 79 order be made at all, whether contributions should be assessed “globally” or “asset by asset” or by reference to 2 or more “pools”, and, what is the nature and extent of each party’s contributions. however, there is no basis for excluding from consideration any property in which the parties have an existing legal or equitable interest. [32] importantly, while it might be convenient to describe property by reference to a characteristic (for example, as an “inheritance” or “post-separation” or “after-acquired” property), its place within the ambit of s 79 is determined by the fact that it exists as a legal or equitable interest of the parties to the marriage or either of them and that the nature, form and characteristics of it and the contributions of all types made by the party suggest that it should be treated in a particular way. [33] the consideration of the three central questions earlier referred to call in each case for the exercise of discretion by a trial judge. that discretion is exercised not by reference to whether property might conveniently be described as “an inheritance” or “after-acquired” but, rather, by reference to the nature, form and characteristics of the property in question and the nature, form and extent of the parties’ contributions of all types across the entirety of their relationship. [34] in respect of the last point, it is important to emphasise that the categorisation of property as “an inheritance” or as “after-acquired” property often leads to an erroneous argument that unless contributions to that property can be established, the property should be “excluded from consideration”. as we have said, that argument is erroneous by reason of ignoring the fundamental premise that s 79 is directed to all of the existing legal and equitable interests in property of the parties or either of them without exclusion of any of those interests.
...a contribution based adjustment in favour of the wife of 20% of the husband’s property, in addition to her retaining the property in country f.
...rather than finding that the wife made a direct or indirect financial contribution to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of the parties’ property (for the purposes of section 79(4)(a)), the court would find that the wife benefited from living in the husband’s home and otherwise having her living expenses subsidised by the husband during the parties’ cohabitation. in the alternative, if the court is minded to make an assessment of each party’s respective financial contributions during the relationship, it is the husband’s submission that the only conclusion that the court can reach is that the husband made the considerably greater financial contribution throughout the parties’ short marriage, and that the husband’s financial contributions during the period of cohabitation outweighed those of the wife by some 260%.
... the parties’ overall non-financial contributions ought to be assessed in the vicinity of 75% – 80% to the husband and 25% – 20% to the wife.
... where there is a short marriage, where there are no children and where the parties’ contributions to their assets and to the welfare of the family from the commencement of the relationship to the time of hearing is equal, any disparity in initial financial contributions is of critical importance in determining the overall contributions of the parties ...
the law  the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in property, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, (2) the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (3) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[14]   the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (3) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[14]   the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court’s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court’s attention.[14]  ] in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[16]   first, “the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities, and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing”,[17] (2) second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [18] (3) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (‘the other factors’) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[19] (4) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[20]   second, “the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties”, [18] (3) third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (‘the other factors’) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[19] (4) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[20]   third, “the court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (‘the other factors’) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...”,[19] (4) fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[20]   fourth, “the court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case”.[20]
... indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513)..[22]  ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial “product” or “value”. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made “...directly or indirectly...” “...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...” and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made “...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...” the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the “financial product” which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable – or, at least, conceptualised – in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent “causal connection” might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the “...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...” or, indeed, to “property” at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to:
... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse’s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[24]
...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.[26]
as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties’ respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews “overly pernickety analysis” and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been “wasted” or to amount to a unilateral “premature distribution of property” and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.[27]
it is plain that where there has been a short marriage and all other things are equal, it may be said that the initial financial contributions of the parties carry great weight. however, here other things are not equal. the parties have had two children and the care and support for the children has almost been borne by the respondent solely ...

is the court is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make an order under section 79 of the act?
... as i already own the property with my mum, and we will be living with her, you would need to contribute something for living in the house and towards the costs for the utilities and the expenses.
... made very minimal if any contribution to the housework.
and the second respondent’s assertion that:   bilic] did not contribute to the housework ....[ms bilic] would occasionally help with the cooking, she would bake a cake if there was a party.
the evidence in cross-examination of both the husband and the second respondent makes plain that the wife did contribute to the homemaking, though they assert not on an equal basis with the second respondent.  ] the expression “just and equitable” is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its meets and bounds. ... [37] the question posed by s 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests [of the parties in the property], the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order. [38] ... although s 79 confers a broad power on a court exercising jurisdiction under the act to make a property settlement order, it is not a power that is to be exercised according to an unguided judicial discretion. .... [it] is a power which “rests upon the law and not upon judicial discretion.” ... [39] because the power to make a property settlement order is not to be exercised in an unprincipled fashion, whether it is “just and equitable” to make the order is not to be answered by assuming that the parties’ rights to or interests in marital property are or should be different from those that then exist. all the more is that so when it is recognised that s 79 of the act must be applied keeping in mind that “[c]ommunity of ownership arising from marriage has no place in the common law”. questions between husband-and-wife about the ownership of property that may be then, or may have been in the past, enjoyed in common are to be “decided according to the same scheme of legal titles and equitable principles as govern the rights of any two persons who are not spouses”. the question presented by s 79 is whether those rights and interests should be altered. [40] ... whether making a property settlement order is “just and equitable” is not to be answered by beginning from the assumption that one or other party has the right to have the property of the parties divided between them or has the right to an interest in marital property which is fixed by reference to the various matters (including financial and other contributions) set out in s 79 (4). the power to make a property settlement order must be exercised “in accordance with legal principles, including the principles which the act itself lays down”. to conclude that making an order is “just and equitable” only because of and by reference to various matters in s 79 (4), without a separate consideration of s 79 (2), would be to conflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles laid down by the act.[30]
