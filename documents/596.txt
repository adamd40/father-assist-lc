reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
he confirmed his intention to participate in the assessment and requested the use of an interpreter which the consultant subsequently arranged. during this discussion, the father repeatedly shouted at the consultant about his anger towards the court, including his anger that the court allowed the child to remain in the mother’s care despite her use of drugs. [mr rosic] appeared to struggle to manage his emotions during the phone call and struggled to pause from speaking long enough to allow the consultant to speak. despite his earlier confirmation, the father failed to attend on the morning of the assessment. the consultant called the father, however, this call was ended after a few short rings.[8]
whilst this assessment is limited by way of the father’s non-attendance, the consultant would encourage the court to consider taking a cautious approach to [x’s] needs and reducing her time spending with her father in line with her mother’s proposal, at least until the father was able to evidence a reduced risk of harm for [x] in his care. for example, his compliance with court orders, and a justifiable explanation for his non-attendance at the recent handovers and the family assessment.[9]
on the morning of the assessment the mother confirmed that she was in the process of attending as requested. she was later advised by the consultant not to do so given the father failed to attend. he was contacted by the consultant and stated that he had recently had surgery and could not attend on the day.[14]   removing the said child from the mother’s care, and (b) attending at the said child’s school of attendance as well as any extra mural activities attended by the said child including any country b dancing or country b school.   attending at the said child’s school of attendance as well as any extra mural activities attended by the said child including any country b dancing or country b school.   he file and serve an affidavit detailing the reasons he failed to attend upon the family report writer, ms k, for the purposes of preparation of such a report, failed to engage with mr d or similar therapist in respect of obtaining therapy for anger and stress management, an explanation as why he has not engaged in the circle of security and kids are first parenting courses, as ordered by the court, and a discharge summary form from the hospital to which he was taken by ambulance on 12 september 2022.
the wife’s case
i didn't have anyone when i moved to australia with him and was alone in a new country and he knew that. he always threatened me that he owned me and could have me deported any moment.[21]
there were numerous other incidents of family violence during the relationship. another incident occurred on 31 december 2016, on this occasion [mr rosic] grabbed me around the neck and strangled me. this was after i asked him to look after our daughter while i had a shower. incidents of family violence occurred monthly and sometimes weekly including [mr rosic] yelling at me, threatening to assault me and threatening to kill me as well as physically assaulting me financially controlling me (he controlled all the finances during our relationship) and generally controlling almost every aspect of my life. i was not allowed to do anything without his permission and would constantly have to account for every minute of my day. i believe that this was primarily driven by his extreme jealousy and insecurity. incidents included physical violence perpetrated by [mr rosic] against me including hitting kicking, pushing, strangling and throwing objects at me. threatening to cancel my visa before i became a permanent resident and to take [x] from me stating that i would never see her again. instances of extreme jealousy which then would lead to abuse. on one occasion [mr rosic] took a knife and threatened me with it while i was holding [x] i had to hide under the table and was extremely afraid. i also didn't want our child to witness that and i was trying to protect her. on another occasion he threw some wet wipes at me while i was holding [x] who was around 6 months old at the time, he missed me and hit the child. he would threaten me many times not to dare call the police, this would also sometimes turn into him begging me not to call the police and saying that they would jail him and it would destroy our family. i would often not call or sometimes even if l initially called them, he would beg me to not tell them anything or threated me and i would not tell the police anything once they arrived and just say it was just an argument when in fact it was a lot more. he would take my car keys with him when he left the house so that i couldn't go anywhere. he constantly threatened me with deportation. he would yell and scream at me, and [x] would be present and witness it all. often the child [x] would cry. he would tell me who i could and couldn't be friends with and would ban me from being friends with certain people. he would ban me from seeing friends because he was also afraid i would tell them what he has been doing to me. my bank card was always with him, he took it from me and i never had access to it. he would not give me any money. if we needed anything, he would go with me and purchase it. i never had any money on me cash or card. i was entirely reliant on him. he had complete control.[22]
the instigation of proceedings
i have never stopped [mr rosic] from spending time with [x]. i have continually tried to promote their relationship as much as i could but for some reason [mr rosic] seems to be fixated on me and not on his relationship with [x]. initially post separation the only thing i asked of him was to please let me know in advance if he wanted to spend time with her so that we could have a life and make plans of our own. he refused to have any set times with her or to at least let me know a day or two in advance. his position was that he will see her whenever he wants and suits him and there is nothing, i could do about it. prior to monday 18 may 2020 he would see her sporadically when it suited him. sometimes weekly on the weekend (say from saturday after work around 6.30pm until 5pm on the sunday), sometimes a few months would pass he would not see her. i never stopped him from seeing her he would just get angry and as a result not see her. he also would say "i work you don't" so would refuse to have her on weekdays.[23]   has told me that her father tells her that mum beats her and then makes her say it out loud and show her bruises on her legs while he is recording her. i am extremely concerned for my child if she is being subjected to this behaviour by the father. i have been told by some members of the [country b] community that some people in the community have seen this video. i absolutely deny any allegations about me hurting our daughter. if she has some bruises, these are through playing and being active. she is a very active child, she also plays sports like soccer.[26]

the family report  rosic] willingly engaged in the interview process and provided a clear and articulate narrative. she presented as having a secure primary attachment to [x] and to be a caring and capable parent. she impressed as being emotionally attuned to [x’s] needs and sensitive to these needs. she also impressed as being child focused and balanced in her views.[27]   presented as an endearing, friendly, talkative, bright and well-adjusted 8-year-old child. she easily engaged with the consultant and provided what appeared to be an open and honest account of her thoughts and feelings. these were made in age appropriate language and were consistent with her tone and affect. [x] reported that she now attended [v school] r to 7 and was in year 2. she spoke positively of her experiences at school, reporting to have “fun” and “friends” and most of all loving the school canteen. [x] spoke positively of her experience in her mother’s care. she loved watching movies and television with her mother, and also loved sometimes sleeping in her bed. when asked if there was anything she did not like about her mother, or her mother’s care, [x] stated in a happy and excitable tone, “i like everything at mum’s house”. ...... [x] reported that she played club soccer and loved it. she proudly added that when she was only 5 years of age she scored a goal. she also reported to participate in dancing and [country b] school on friday and wednesday afternoons, and that she liked both so much she wished they were on every day. [x] explained that her mother took her to these activities and that “dad wouldn’t, not ever to the festival or the dance”. she went on to say in a matter of fact and sad tone of voice, “my dad never takes me, he doesn’t like my mum, he always says the f word and the s and d word”. when the consultant sought clarification as to some of these words, [x] spelt out “dickhead” and “idiot”. she went on to explain that she would also overhear her father speaking negatively about her mother to her grandmother and grandfather, and also when her father was on the phone to people in [country b]. she stated that this made her feel “sad”. she added, “and i get really angry”. [x] added, “and my dad doesn’t cook good food and he’s jealous about mum and [mr j] but not me”. she also explained that her father did not like her new school and he preferred her previous school because it was closer to his house. she added again in a sad tone, “he’s always angry at everyone, he yells at me sometimes and he yells at my brother”. when asked if [x] felt safe in each parent’s care, [x] stated that she did feel safe in her mother’s care but not her father’s care. she stated that this was because when he took her to the park he would expect her to play alone whilst he sat in the car on his phone. she stated that sometimes there were other children and parents present but other times she was the only one left in the park alone. [x] understood what the current time spending arrangements were. she stated that in the future she would like to “stay with mum the whole week”. [x] understood that this would mean no time with her father, and she explained it was because his food was “always yuck”, for example, cold chicken which was “gross”. in contrast she considered her mother to be a “really good” cook who always cooked her delicious foods.[28]
she described her father as someone who was angry, often yelling, directly denigrating her mother with offensive language causing her to feel “sad” and generally providing a parenting environment that left her feeling unsafe. [x’s] disclosures appeared to be a reliable account of her personally held thoughts and feelings and to be a reflection of her own life experiences. as such, the court would be recommended to add particular weight to her comments in interview when considering her future best interests for time spending with each parent.[29]
