the nature of an undefended hearing e wife] is entitled to have her application for settlement of property matters determined within a reasonable period of time pursuant to the applicable principles of law. this is important, given the delays which have arisen in the conduct of the case, none of which are attributable to any act or omission attributable to [the wife]. as such, she needs neither [the husband’s] formal imprimatur, nor his cooperation to have her application determined. rather, there is an obligation, on the part of [the husband] if he wishes to be involved in the proceedings for him to attend at court as required and to pursue any application put by him or on his behalf with due diligence. the federal circuit court and family court is a court of private law. it determines disputes between parties according to law. in this case, according to the provisions of part viii of the family law act 1975 (cth) (‘the act’) which relate to the division of property following the breakdown of a de facto relationship. the court cannot compel a party to engage with litigation. it is however obliged to give each party the opportunity to put evidence before the court and, if he or she so wishes to do, contest any evidence relied upon by the opposing party. however, a party, whether by intransigence, disinterest or manipulation, cannot succeed in denying an applicant a just resolution according to law to his or her application by choosing not to take part in proceedings because they do not proceed in the manner of his or her preference. that would be fundamentally unfair to the opposing party and an affront to the proper administration of justice which requires that a properly instituted application be finalised within a reasonable period of time relative to the complexity and issues raised in such an application.[2]   for the purposes of rule 10.27, an applicant is in default if the applicant fails (a) comply with an order of the court in the proceeding, or (b) file and serve a document required under these rules, or (c) produce a document as required by division 6.2.2, or (d) do any act required to be done by these rules, or (e) prosecute the proceeding with due diligence.[3]

whether or not that last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, and (b) the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the de facto relationship, or a child of the de facto relationship: (i) to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, or (ii) otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property, whether or not that last-mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the de facto relationship or either of them, and (c) the contribution made by a party to the de facto relationship to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the de facto relationship and any children of the de facto relationship, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent, and (d) the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the de facto relationship, and (e) the matters referred to in subsection 90sf(3) so far as they are relevant, and (f) any other order made under this act affecting a party to the de facto relationship or a child of the de facto relationship, and (g) any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the de facto relationship has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the de facto relationship.[5]

the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment, and (c) whether either party has the care or control of a child of the de facto relationship who has not attained the age of 18 years, and (d) commitments of each of the parties that are necessary to enable the party to support: (i) himself or herself, and (ii) a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain, and (e) the responsibilities of either party to support any other person, and (f) subject to subsection (4), the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under: (i) any law of the commonwealth, of a state or territory or of another country, or (ii) any superannuation fund or scheme, whether the fund or scheme was established, or operates, within or outside australia, and the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party, and (g) a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable, and (h) the extent to which the payment of maintenance to the party whose maintenance is under consideration would increase the earning capacity of that party by enabling that party to undertake a course of education or training or to establish himself or herself in a business or otherwise to obtain an adequate income, and (i) the effect of any proposed order on the ability of a creditor of a party to recover the creditor's debt, so far as that effect is relevant, and (j) the extent to which the party whose maintenance is under consideration has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other party, and (k) the duration of the de facto relationship and the extent to which it has affected the earning capacity of the party whose maintenance is under consideration, and (l) the need to protect a party who wishes to continue that party's role as a parent, and (m) if either party is cohabiting with another person--the financial circumstances relating to the
