...was consistent with descriptions of effects of patterns of disrespect, resentment and gendered hostility. these are consistent with definitions and descriptions that other women commonly use to describe acts of domestic violence directed at them and involving deliberate acts of coercive control as define on page-3 of this report. in this writer’s experience and through the narrative invitational framework any manifestation of mental ill health as alleged can be viewed as a contextual response to fear, stress, control and deprivation of freedoms and degradation of personhood experienced by a person subjected to coercive control.[1]
parents should stay together for the sake of their children, which gave reason for her “dropping the charges”. she believed the husband wanted the same things and while she feared him, she felt that the difficulties could be helped by counselling or other interventions, including her “trying more.
the relationship did not support her, nor hold love for her. she realised that she could become stronger in her-self and in her parenting if they separated. after these realisations she said that she was able to stop reacting and “let go” of his verbal abuse of her, that she had decided that his abuse should not affect her hopes for her life. she said that she came to see the age gap as creating some difficulties in creating expectations of her that were unrealistic.
she would react back to him, complaining and “tell him-off” for not helping or supporting her parenting. she said that she was not verbally abusive and would not wish to undermine the children’s opinion and feelings for their father. she said that “this is between me and him and not the kids”.
greek heritage and relationships as being stereotypically “loud and expressive”, that the children understand this, and she sees the children as not being worried by this. the wife was reported as stating “she has experienced this relations as more “controlling” than just a (stereotyped) “loud relationship”.[2]
the husband
it is the opposite for her. i don’t have to tell him the mother is mean to me, he sees it. [x] says “i am sorry mum is so mean to you papa”. i then tell him that his mother is mentally unwell and that she needs medication.
husband’s counsellor, mr o
...it is not clear to this writer the level to which [mr monellis] recognises his agency and responsibility for “getting loud” and thus his responsibility for the impact that has had on his children.[4]
when i get angry i said that. i don’t think there is anything wrong with that...when she upsets me i might say those things...call her fat whore, bald headed witch.[5]
...the potential for [mr monellis] to make unusual interpretations based on selective evidence. [mr monellis] described to this writer his anguish resulting from his detailed belief that the covid vaccine is going to cause a “genocide”, because vaccine recipients will be dead in 2 years. [mr monellis] said the leaders who orchestrated this genocide will face a “nuremberg” style court. and that a world police force aligned with donald trump will arrest and prosecute those responsible for the vaccine genocide.[6]   monellis] demonstrates ethical strivings to resist using physical and verbal violence to his children and strives to provide them with care and guidance. there are indications that [mr monellis] does not appreciate some of the impact his parenting choices are having on the children (withdrawing his love). it is not clear that [mr monellis] appreciates his agency in, and responsibility for impacting the children by “getting loud”. the children are exposed to a high conflict situation at home and there are indications that this is impacting them now. research suggests that this conflict (including abuse) at home is putting at risk the children’s future development in multiple domains of life, even if the abuse is not directed towards the children. [mr monellis] describes actions he engages in that are abusive: violating [ms monellis’s] privacy with secret recording equipment in her bedroom, and verbal abuse, including targeting [ms monellis’s] symptoms arising from her medical condition.
it is important for [mr monellis’s] relationships and for his children’s development that he broadens his focus from [ms monellis’s] behaviour to critiquing himself using greater awareness of the impact he has on others, including how he impacts the children via abuse to their mother.[7]
court child expert ms e
if the husband was able to demonstrate that he could manage practical aspects of the children’s care, she would eventually support week about time. the wife reported that the husband was ‘not a bad father’, rather that his motivations and actions currently were substantially led by the parties’ property dispute, which he believed would be advantaged by in seeking to be the children’s primary carer.[9]
she felt increased confidence to involve police due to increased social capital, both informal and formal, and that her counsellor had assisted her in identifying the father’s behaviours as indicative of family violence.[10]
...tended to provide an internally inconsistent account with regard to his care role with the children, in that he sought primary care of them yet acknowledged the mother remained their primary carer and he had little awareness into their needs.[14]
...he therefore wanted ‘100% care of the children’, and that the mother’s time with the children should be supervised because ‘she is dangerous’. he conveyed his concerns that if not supervised, the mother will “kill” the children, he could not confirm that she had threatened to do so, nor provide specific concerns relating to what led him to make this serious claim. he rather stated that she had threatened to kill him “any time that i step in to help” the children when the mother is “yelling at the children”.[15]
...had manipulated him to commence a relationship, including having children and taking advantage of his kindness towards her in providing a safe haven from her dysfunctional family.[16]
the primary issue risk factor, which remains in dispute, is the issue of family violence. the mother’s account was consistent with that of a victim-survivor of physical, emotional and financial coercive-controlling violence. she provided an internally consistent and credible account of her experiences (in that they were consistent with the experiences of a victim of coercion-control), with her past actions in withdrawing charges consistent with her lack of social support and position of powerlessness within the relationship. this relationship took place under the dynamics of a patriarchal cultural context, with an added imbalance of age... (the wife) confirmed her contributions to the conflict and reactive violence, both to the consultant and wither counsellor (who similarly tended to view the mother’s behaviour as reactive due to her victim-survivor position). the mother’s increased confident post-separation seems due to her increased social capacity and insight into her experiences of violence.[19]
consistently and often without basis or in an exaggerated manner raised concerns about the mother, and tended not to convey that he valued her role and relationship with the children. he tended to equate her expectations that he contribute to the parenting role as her being neglectful. he also tended to equate his parenting capacity as being the primary earner, yet it seemed the case he had little insight into the children’s practical needs.[21]
tended to suggest that he did in fact undermine the children’s interactions with the mother, despite confirming her role as primary carer, he seemed to undermine her instructions and routine with the children as well as interacting with them in an emotionally abusive manner by virtue of implying that their primary carer was unsafe and unstable. ...[mr monellis] throughout his interview...tended to convey the sense that his behaviours were justified, and he had limited insight into the children’s emotional needs. the consultant also noted his confirmation to the counsellor that his behaviour was emotionally abusive in withdrawing affection/attention from y as a form of discipline. to sum, [mr monellis’] parenting stance seemed to echo aspects of parenting capacity noted commonly in perpetrators of coercive-control, undermining of the primary carer, limited insight into the children’s emotional needs and emotional manipulation so as to prompt a specific response.[22]
...given [x’s] exposure both the culturally influenced hierarchy of the household and the violent dynamics, as a young male he unsurprising seeks to align himself with the male parent whom holds the control and power rather than with the more vulnerable positon of the female/mother, whom he has been told is unstable. [x] also has likely learnt what occurs when the father is challenged, and therefore amends his behaviour and views to maximise his father’s positive attention. given all of that noted, it follows that [x] is aligned with the father and therefore the consultant was wary of placing weight on his wishes to live with the father.[23]
...actually engaging in alienating the children from the mother by virtue of conveying his belief that she is unsafe and unstable. his behaviour is already starting to de-stabilise the mother’s relationship with [x] especially. the father furthermore does not support her parenting of the children and conveys little value for these relationships...[24]
little evidence to suggest a primary change in care was warranted, or that the mother’s time with the children should be supervised. the consultant was wary also of supporting an equal care arrangement, given the concerning dynamics of violence and emotional abuse. [25]
maximise the children’s exposure to the father’s abuse of both of them and the mother, and further destabilise their relationships with the mother.[26]
...no time spending would increase the children’s anger at the mother and further destabilise these relationships, the children also seemed to enjoy interaction with the father and the mother suggested that there were positive elements to this relationship. therefore, the consultant rather sought to strike a balance between enough time to maintain the father’s relationship with the children against not further de-stabilising the primary carer’s relationship with the children by virtue of the children’s exposure to the father’s alienating behaviour, poor role modelling and undermining of the mother...[27]
has little confidence that the father will change his behaviour it was recommended that the children engage in counselling with a therapist skilled in the dynamics of family violence and alienation so as to assist the children in increasing their coping skills and capacity to reality test their experiences and form their own views. this will also serve as a protective factor in light of time spending with the father.[28]
...the presence of conflict and discord in a co-parenting relationship doesn’t support an equal time arrangement being of benefit to the children.

parental responsibility  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. note: the presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61b. it does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65daa). (2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in:   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or (b) family violence.   when the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order. (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.[43]

in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of martial property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[54]
