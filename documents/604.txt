primary considerations
a) the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents, and b) the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
in applying the considerations set out in the subsection (2), the court is to give greater weight to the consideration in paragraph 2(b). see s.60cc(2a) of the act.   approved the interpretation that a “meaningful relationship” is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child (citing mazorski v albright [2007] famca 520, (2007) 37 fam lr 518, per brown j and mccall v clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 per the full court), and (b) concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), and (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that the preferred interpretation of s.60cc(2)(a) is that the court should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents (“the prospective approach”), and (c) noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   noted that s.60cc(3)(b) of the act requires a court to explore existing relationships between a child and the child’s parents and other persons and thus, depending upon the factual circumstances, its examination of the evidence as to the nature of the child’s relationships at the date of hearing (“the present relationship approach”) may also be relevant, and (d) confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   confirmed that the legislation aspires to promote a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship, (m v s [2006] famca 1408, (2007) flc 93-313 per dessau j, godfrey v sanders [2007] famca 102 per kay j and champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 per the full court), and (e) concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.   concluded that a “meaningful relationship” is a legal construct, not a psychological one, and it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a meaningful relationship.
abuse, in relation to a child, means: (a) an assault, including a sexual assault, of the child, or (b) a person (the first person) involving the child in a sexual activity with the first person or another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly, as a sexual object by the first person or the other person, and where there is unequal power in the relationship between the child and the first person, or (c) causing the child to suffer serious psychological harm, including (but not limited to) when that harm is caused by the child being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, or (d) serious neglect of the child. family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful.   a person (the first person) involving the child in a sexual activity with the first person or another person in which the child is used, directly or indirectly, as a sexual object by the first person or the other person, and where there is unequal power in the relationship between the child and the first person, or (c) causing the child to suffer serious psychological harm, including (but not limited to) when that harm is caused by the child being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, or   causing the child to suffer serious psychological harm, including (but not limited to) when that harm is caused by the child being subjected to, or exposed to, family violence, or   an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or (d) repeated derogatory taunts, or (e) intentionally damaging or destroying property, or (f) intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, or (g) unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member’s family, of his or her liberty.   unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member’s family, of his or her liberty.   unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member’s family, of his or her liberty.   preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member’s family, of his or her liberty.   unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member’s family, of his or her liberty.   the primary consideration referred to in s.60cc(2)(a) of the act is supportive of the position that as much time as possible with both parents are in the children’s best interests. the court accepts that the children have a meaningful relationship with both of their parents and that the final parenting orders, agreed to by them, promote those relationships. (b) in that regard, the father submitted that it would be accepted that whether the children benefit from a meaningful relationship with each of their parents is not a matter, significantly, impacted by proposed orders made for changeover, other than with respect to ensuring that changeovers do not create conflict or interfere with the final parenting orders which have been effected to ensure a meaningful relationship with both parents. (c) the father submitted that the need to protect the children from being exposed to family violence was a matter that loomed large in this case in light of the history of the matter and, in the circumstances, where each party had alleged that the other has engaged in family violence during the course of their relationship. each parent, however, denied perpetrating any such violence as referred to below. accordingly, he maintained that his proposal mitigated the risk of exposing the children to family violence and parental conflict and, consequently, the potential for psychological harm to the children as it would allow for changeovers to occur in a neutral location and allow for the possibility of agents of the parents to assist at such changeovers. the mother, however, submitted that, in the circumstances where the father’s concerns about conflict were confined to face-to-face contact between the parties at changeover, the father’s proposal still encouraged the parties to attend changeovers themselves despite that alleged risk. the mother’s proposal was to the effect that each party would deliver the children to the other’s residence so as to effect changeovers. (d) the mother submitted that the father’s greatest concern arising with respect to the issue of changeover was the risk of conflict and interference with the final parenting orders in circumstances where both parties had made allegations against the other regarding instances of verbal abuse and coercive and controlling behaviour and both parties denied the respective allegations against them. in that regard, she maintained that there was no evidence that the children had been exposed to conflict during changeover since interim orders had been in place, as referred to in paragraph 12(h), above. the court also notes and gives some weight to the fact that the interim orders also provided for changeovers to occur at the paternal grandmother’s residence. the fact that there have been little problems with that weigh in favour of that option being available to the father if his work commitments preclude the children being delivered by the mother to him.   in that regard, the father submitted that it would be accepted that whether the children benefit from a meaningful relationship with each of their parents is not a matter, significantly, impacted by proposed orders made for changeover, other than with respect to ensuring that changeovers do not create conflict or interfere with the final parenting orders which have been effected to ensure a meaningful relationship with both parents.

additional considerations any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child's views,  the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child's parents, (ii) and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child),  the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity:  to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  ) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child,  i) to communicate with the child,   the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child, the likely effect of any changes in the child's circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from: (i) either of his or her parents,   or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living, the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child's right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis, the capacity of: (i) each of the child's parents, to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs  any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs,
in terms of changeovers, i am not satisfied that the mother’s fear of the father is such that the parties cannot attend changeovers in person. the mother’s emphasis was on her perception of x’s fear of the parties being in conflict. the parties can use agents, such as grandparents, if they prefer, but if they attend they are to act in a civil and cordial fashion to avoid putting x at further harm from their conduct.”  the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child's parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant.
... this is a matter where it appears that the children have been exposed to, at worst, family violence and in the very least parental conflict. regardless of which parent’s narrative is correct, the exposure of children to family violence and/or parental conflict has a detrimental impact on a child’s emotional, educational, behavioural and social development. it is imperative that both parents do all in their capacity to ensure that the children are protected from further exposure to ongoing family violence and/or parental conflict during video calls or at changeovers (if they occur face to face). ... ...to reduce the chances of conflict occurring and the amount of face-to-face contact, the changeover could occur at school and day-care and a neutral venue on non-school days. ideally, the parents should be working towards facilitating the changeovers themselves and cannot be reliant on the paternal grandmother or others to undertake it, particularly if it is going to become a regularly occurring arrangement.  9] ... whilst the peculiar and dysfunctional dynamics within this family seem now to be entrenched, the ... obligation at law ... remains firmly, unequivocally, and unambiguously to facilitate and encourage the children’s relationship with [the other party]. it is a positive rather than passive obligation.  if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child: (i) the child's right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and (ii) the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right,  the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents, any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family,  if a family violence order applies, or has applied, (be it final, interim, contested or consented to) to the child or a member of the child’s family-any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following:  the nature of the order, (ii) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  ) the circumstances in which the order was made, (iii) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  i) any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, (iv) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,  ) any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, (v) any other relevant matter,   any other relevant matter,   in mandic & bellaire [2016] famca 478 (particularly at [71]), where the court allowed for changeover to occur at the child’s school for the purpose of avoiding conflict between the parents and further highlighted that this was a relevant consideration pursuant to s 60cc(2)(b) of the act to protect a child from being exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence, and (b) in webb & guthrie [2016] fcca 2285, where the mother was given the option of nominating a nominee to effect changeover or nominating a public place or both due to the nature of the parental relationship, being one of high conflict.   in webb & guthrie [2016] fcca 2285, where the mother was given the option of nominating a nominee to effect changeover or nominating a public place or both due to the nature of the parental relationship, being one of high conflict.  whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child  any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
