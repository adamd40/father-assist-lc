reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
i love the family home...it’s the only home i’ve known...it’s the only house i’ve felt safe...[8]  ldwell] stated that they both had agreed that they wanted to separate and divorce, but neither party wished to move out of the family home. [goldwell] stated that she had already sought legal advice and it was her intention to remain at the family home for as long as possible. [goldwell] was not in fear of [capri] and it appeared to police that [x] was being unnecessarily exposed to the ongoing issues between the parents. police provided [goldwell] with information on support services.[9]
concerns regarding [x]'s behaviour and the impact his parents separation is having upon him, behaviours including, emotional dysregulation, daily outbursts of violence towards his mother and property, self-harming by head banging, skin picking and suicidal ideation. concerns that the parents are attempting to alienate [x] from the other parent and making allegations of abuse against each other. there were also allegations that [x] disclosed abuse, including the mother putting her hand around [x]’s throat and strangling him during an argument and the mother hitting him about the head with her handbag. this information was reported to sapol. concerns the father has engaged in gas lighting and verbally abusing the mother for many years, and that the mother is going to return to the family home to reside. it was alleged that [x] mimics his father’s behaviour. allegations the father perpetrates domestic violence towards the mother and is physically abusive towards [x]. concerns the father is alienating the mother from [x] and allegedly told [x] he cannot wait until the mother is dead, stating he will dance on her grave. [x] allegedly told the mother "mum be careful" and "if i go away mum do you promise to keep looking for me". [x] allegedly stated that the father hit him in the face and punched him in the stomach on 28/06/22 after [x] had defended his mother. a notifier reported concerns for [x]’s emotional wellbeing, believing that [x] was being isolated by the father since they had left the family home. the father was not allowing the mother contact with [x] and the father had ceased [x]’s home schooling and social activities. the most recent notification reported allegation that the mother's poor mental health was making her volatile, manipulative and controlling. it was alleged that the mother had physically abused [x] and that he had stated that he was scared. the notifier reported that they believed [x] was being put in the middle of his parents’ custody case.[10]
ms b’s child impact report
the child impact report provides to the parties and the court preliminary expert advice about the needs and experiences of children. any views expressed or professional recommendations made by the court child expert are, of necessity, limited.[11]
regardless of whether either parent’s account is accepted, it seems that in the absence of collaborative and mutually supportive and respectful parenting, a now teenager [x] is rebelling against his parents’ seemingly markedly different parenting styles and is choosing the least conflictual option, namely his father.[12]  ’s apparent rejection of his mother is in the context of chronically disputing parents. his seemingly angry and alienated stance toward his mother could be construed as one way of adapting to such circumstances, with such a coping response raising questions about whether this may become a maladaptive and enduring way of relating to others, which would be to his detriment developmentally, in the long term.[13] for such a reportedly temperamentally vulnerable child as [x], such an aligned stance could be interpreted as an expected response to an intolerable situation, with [x] likely to be able to recover his relationship with his mother as he matures, provided he is not forced into a relationship with her. this process might be accelerated if [x] were to attend counselling with a specialised therapist, who may be able to assist him to understand and process his seemingly intense mixed feelings arising from his reported lived experience of having been allegedly subject to inappropriate or unsafe behaviours by the mother (such as biting), as well as being an only child in a high conflict family.[14]   on or before 29 september 2022 the mother file and serve a further affidavit detailing the following: (a) her response, if any to the child impact report of [ms b], (b) her attempts thus far to obtain emergency accommodation and/or a private rental for herself and how long she needs to obtain alternative accommodation and what is the likely cost thereof to herself, and (c) any evidence on which she wishes to rely in respect of the child’s current situation and in respect of what occurred on 19 september 2022. (2) on or before 3 october the father filed and serve a further affidavit detailing the following: (a) his response, if any to the child impact report of [ms b], (b) what financial assistance in dollar terms he can provide to the mother to obtain emergency accommodation for herself, (c) how long he and [x] can continue sharing accommodation with friends, (d) the practicalities and expense of him obtaining alternative accommodation for himself and [x] on the private rental market, and (e) any evidence on which he wishes to rely in respect of the child’s current situation and in respect of what occurred on 19 september 2022. (3) further consideration of the matter is adjourned to 6 october 2022 at 2.15pm regarding the sole occupancy issue to take place at court on a face to face basis.   her response, if any to the child impact report of [ms b], (b) her attempts thus far to obtain emergency accommodation and/or a private rental for herself and how long she needs to obtain alternative accommodation and what is the likely cost thereof to herself, and (c) any evidence on which she wishes to rely in respect of the child’s current situation and in respect of what occurred on 19 september 2022.   her attempts thus far to obtain emergency accommodation and/or a private rental for herself and how long she needs to obtain alternative accommodation and what is the likely cost thereof to herself, and (c) any evidence on which she wishes to rely in respect of the child’s current situation and in respect of what occurred on 19 september 2022.   any evidence on which she wishes to rely in respect of the child’s current situation and in respect of what occurred on 19 september 2022.   on or before 3 october the father filed and serve a further affidavit detailing the following: (a) his response, if any to the child impact report of [ms b], (b) what financial assistance in dollar terms he can provide to the mother to obtain emergency accommodation for herself, (c) how long he and [x] can continue sharing accommodation with friends, (d) the practicalities and expense of him obtaining alternative accommodation for himself and [x] on the private rental market, and (e) any evidence on which he wishes to rely in respect of the child’s current situation and in respect of what occurred on 19 september 2022.

legal considerations
how the court determines a child’s best interests
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the persons family, or causes the family member to be fearful.
the sole object of any parenting case is on the pursuit and safeguard of the best interests of the children affected, not on the perceived rights of the parents concerned. because of this focus, it is invariably the case that the court obtains some form of expert appraisal of the family involved, which includes an observation of the child or children concerned, which, depending on the age of those children, will include some form of interview with them by the relevant expert. ... it is frequently the case that recommendations made by a family report writer are highly controversial between the parents concerned, particularly if the recommendations made favour a significant change to existing provisional parenting regimes, implemented at an earlier interim hearing stage. in this context, one parent may seek to re-agitate parenting arrangements in advance of the scheduled final hearing, for which the family report was ordered in the first place, on the basis of recommendations made. this scenario has the potential to create its own dilemmas, which include the following: it is the court, not the expert, no matter how well qualified, who is charged with the determination of the case concerned, this is because it is the court which is best placed to make findings of fact, regarding issues of credit, based on how witnesses, including expert ones, perform under cross-examination, however, any such expert has a significant advantage, over the court, because he/she has had the opportunity to have a face to face interaction with the child or children concerned, which the court will never have, on the other hand, the expert does not have the advantage of seeing witnesses, particularly parents, subjected to the forensic scrutiny, which cross-examination provides, in addition, as with any interim hearing, at this stage, the methodology of the expert concerned, including whether his/her recommendations are based on some misconception or misunderstanding of the evidence, cannot be subject to scrutiny. for these reasons, at the interim hearing stage, the court must be careful in how it approaches the recommendations provided by a family report. on the one hand, the court should avoid an excessive number of interim hearings.
decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing.[23]
sole occupancy
114(1)...the court may make such order or grant such injunction as it considers proper with respect to the matter to which the proceedings relate, including – ...   an injunction restraining a party to the marriage from entering or remaining in the matrimonial home or the premises in which the other party to the marriage resides, or restraining a party to the marriage from entering or remaining in a specified area, being an area in which the matrimonial home is, or the premises in which the other party to the marriage resides are, situated,
... (e) an injunction in relation to the property of a party to the marriage, (f) an injunction relating to the use or occupancy of the matrimonial home.  s it really sensible to expect a wife ... to endure the pressures which the continued presence of the other spouse will place upon them.[28]  he court should regard the situation between the parties as being such that it would not be reasonable or sensible or practicable to expect them to continue to remain in the home together.[29]
