the legislation
the court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.
the approach to applications under s.79  to identify the pool of assets and liabilities generally, and usually at the time of hearing, (2) to assess the relative contributions of both the financial, non-financial, direct and indirect nature as specified by s.79(4) of the act, (3) to consider the factors as are relevant contained in s.75(2) of the act, and (4) finally, to determine whether the order the court proposes to make is just and equitable to both parties.[1]   to assess the relative contributions of both the financial, non-financial, direct and indirect nature as specified by s.79(4) of the act, (3) to consider the factors as are relevant contained in s.75(2) of the act, and (4) finally, to determine whether the order the court proposes to make is just and equitable to both parties.[1]   to consider the factors as are relevant contained in s.75(2) of the act, and (4) finally, to determine whether the order the court proposes to make is just and equitable to both parties.[1]   finally, to determine whether the order the court proposes to make is just and equitable to both parties.[1]   whether the parties have separated, (b) the assets and liabilities of each party, (c) the contributions of each party, (d) the future needs of each party, (e) bearing in mind all of the foregoing matters, whether it is just and equitable to make any orders altering the interests of the parties in their property, and (f) what orders, if any, are just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.   the assets and liabilities of each party, (c) the contributions of each party, (d) the future needs of each party, (e) bearing in mind all of the foregoing matters, whether it is just and equitable to make any orders altering the interests of the parties in their property, and (f) what orders, if any, are just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.   the contributions of each party, (d) the future needs of each party, (e) bearing in mind all of the foregoing matters, whether it is just and equitable to make any orders altering the interests of the parties in their property, and (f) what orders, if any, are just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.   the future needs of each party, (e) bearing in mind all of the foregoing matters, whether it is just and equitable to make any orders altering the interests of the parties in their property, and (f) what orders, if any, are just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.   bearing in mind all of the foregoing matters, whether it is just and equitable to make any orders altering the interests of the parties in their property, and (f) what orders, if any, are just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.   what orders, if any, are just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.
in considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court shall take into account [the various matters set out in section 79(4)] ...
in our view, it will be less likely that the separate issues arising under s 79(2) and (4) will be conflated if judges refrain from evaluating contributions and other relevant factors in percentage or monetary terms until they have first determined that it would be just and equitable to make an order.
