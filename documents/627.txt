[x] and [y] have grown up so far in the [region o] area where they and the parents have supports and connections. he has no desire to relocate and said that opportunities for himself and [ms j] are extremely limited in [city b].

the mother
and since the demise of the relationship i’ve done my best to try to find ways to make it work and, you know, such a – such a big decision is not something that was made – like, i feel like you’re insinuating that it was made at the drop of a hat or on a whim, and it wasn’t. it’s something i gave a lot of thought to and i – i spoke with people and i sought counsel from friends that i trust.[6]
the mother’s present circumstances
but being down here by myself i – i don’t have that support. i have friends that are at arm’s length. but, as you can potentially imagine, it’s – they’re not the sorts of friendships where i can be myself. i would be mortified if my friends down here saw me like this. with [ms m] and my dad, my brother, my other girlfriends and cousins, they’ve known me for long enough that i can – it’s – it’s a genuine support. i don’t have to put up a front and pretend that everything’s sunshine and rainbows. my work is incredibly important to me and – and i want to do the very best for that as well. i’m incredibly torn in relation to trying to find a balance between them both and do right by myself.[8]
and in regards to those commutes as well, it’s not just about me and the commute. it’s the time that the children need to be at before and after school care and day care as well. in order for me to get a – a certain amount of work done at work – and those days are cut short because of the – the drop-off and pickup which i then either make up of an evening or, on the days when i don’t have the children, so i’m averaging maybe 12-hour working days and the commute either side of that.[9]
considerable thought to the situation and i feel like the – these long days that – for – for the boys as well – i mean, it’s – it’s not sustainable. it’s not something that i want for them. i would like them to be able to go and play at friends’ houses after school or do extracurricular activities on weekdays instead of trying to cram everything into chaotic weekends.[10]
the mother’s proposed employment in city b
i think by – adjusting my lifestyle enables me to be an even better mum for the children. it’s – i mean, being a – a working parent, there are really sort of two sides to you and – and by simplifying the lifestyle and the – the day-to-day stresses and things like that will – will free me up to be able to do more with the children. i mean, at the moment, it’s – it would be quite difficult, for example, during the week extracurricular activities.[11]
the job advertisement obtains a number of candidates for a pool, which they work through through attrition of other staff members, and then they will readvertise the same position. for example, it was readvertised a month or two ago as well, so they’re – it’s a repetitive job advertisement. ... the [agency] actually showed a significant amount of flexibility based on my personal situation in the proceedings before the court and were willing to – to push it back – push the start date – start date back and be quite accommodating. and i imagine that that would be the same again. the information that i was provided is because i was a strong candidate and they felt i would be an asset to [new staff].[12]
it is difficult to understand why, in this case, the mother’s evidence concerning her future career prospects and employment was dismissed as no more than a belief. after all, she had a track record of securing work in her field in various states and spoke with the voice of experience as to her suitability for several projects then underway in city k.

the father’s present circumstances
ms j  she has no family or friends in city b, (b) she will have to resign from her current employment. her role is melbourne-based and cannot be done remotely, and (c) relocating to city b would affect her emotionally, mentally and financially and would cause her undue stress and strain and this will impact on her ability to best support the children.   she will have to resign from her current employment. her role is melbourne-based and cannot be done remotely, and (c) relocating to city b would affect her emotionally, mentally and financially and would cause her undue stress and strain and this will impact on her ability to best support the children.   relocating to city b would affect her emotionally, mentally and financially and would cause her undue stress and strain and this will impact on her ability to best support the children.
the father moving to city b  the country g community is almost non-existent in city b and it would be incredibly difficult for him and the children to maintain a connection to country g culture, (b) he has no family in city b and socially he does not know anyone. he would have “zero” support, (c) he would be in a hostile environment as he asserts that the mother’s family has cut all ties with him post separation. i note though that mr l says the lack of communication between them was not intended to be indicative of cutting all ties, (d) moving to a new city from country g to city b was incredibly hard and stressful and the prospect of having to do so again is “very scary and distressing”,[28] (e) he would feel lonely and isolated, (f) being under great emotional and financial stress will affect his ability to parent the children, (g) he will have to resign from his current employment as he cannot work from home all of the time, (h) being a part of a business is very important to him. since his arrival in melbourne he has worked very hard to restart his career from zero and to reach the level of pay and conditions he has today, (i) a move to city b would be very detrimental to his career as city b is not the central work hub and therefore the opportunities of work for him in city b will be very limited, (j) he will likely have to take a pay cut and may not have flexible work arrangements to suit the children’s routine, (k) the move to city b would have a “massive financial impact”[29] as he would have to finance the cost of the move and periods of unemployment. he has no financial support in australia other than his full-time wage, (l) ms j would have to resign from her current role and it is highly likely she will struggle to find a new role in city b, (m) the median house price in city b is now higher than in melbourne and it will be difficult for them to purchase a property in city b, and (n) rental accommodation costs are also higher in city b than in

there is an inherent tension between, on the one hand, separated parents being able to establish new homes wherever they like and, on the other, their restraint by injunction from living too far apart to avoid any impingement of their children’s ability to retain meaningful relationships with both parents. the conflict is between the best interests of the children to know and have regular personal contact with each parent and the interests of the parents to enjoy a high measure of freedom of movement which is not lost by reason only of their parental responsibility for the children (see ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 (“ams v aif”) at 196, 206, 207-208, 210).
parental responsibility
equal or substantial and significant time
best interests
any increase in time with [mr talsma] will be in [x] and [y]’s best interests if made when they are emotionally and cognitively ready and well prepared.
if a sixth night in each fortnight is introduced, this might be best done during the 2022/2023 summer school holidays. this might provide the scaffolding to continue the arrangements successfully into the 2023 school year. how [y] will adjust to prep in 2023 is yet to be determined. it would be in the boys’ best interests that their parents be prepared to pause the increase if the children struggle to cope with the extended time away from their mother. the parents might consider avoiding any increase to time (being seven nights in each fortnight) until the 2023- 2024 summer school holidays or beyond.
the considerations
meaningful relationship
at their ages, [x] and [y] would be burdened by long telephone conversations and unable to provide the level of detail their father would require to maintain a fulsome understanding of their lives. if relocation is permitted, to preserve the father- son relationships and to alleviate the pressure of [the father] having to ‘catch up’ on details/interests during spend time– the children would require [the mother] to report to [the father], regularly and in detail, the boys ever changing development and interests. the benefits in this matter are that the parents are currently amicable and communicating well and that could continue post relocation. however, this requirement of [the mother] would be labour intensive longer term, and it is queried if even the most motivated parent would have the capacity to sustain this.
the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant
the children
since the children were born, it was me that approached [nn library] and said, “have you got [country g] literature?” and started asking them weekly to collate [country g] literature for the children. they watch programs on television in [country g language]. i’m making attempts to learn better [country g language]. the children have a standard of [country g language] that they giggle and correct me if i mispronounce things.[48] i’ve always demonstrated a support for the children to be bilingual. there’s nothing cuter than watching those two little guys speak [country g language].[49]
...that frame is not going to teach them [country g language]. that frame is not going to cook for them or – you know, any [country g] meals or any [country g] food... ‑but, sorry, how does a frame shows any commitment to anything? what access to their culture do they have through a picture on the wall? i don’t – i don’t understand. that’s – i’m the – the link to the culture, and if they was allowed to go to [city b], they would lose all links to the culture because they wouldn’t do anything [country g related]. they won’t go – they won’t be going to a [country g language] school. they won’t have access to their father, so they – they... i thought they had a right to their culture.[51]
the hours i spend with them speaking [country g language] won’t be replaced by the 30-minute or, you know, even an hour conversation, you know, over the – over the phone or – or video. it’s not – it just not the same – yes, not the same quality.[52]
the mother  the child was younger than the children in this matter, (b) after the mother had moved she may have been required to relocate again subject to where she may be deployed for duty, and (c) at the time of the hearing the mother’s proposal was “somewhat inchoate”.   after the mother had moved she may have been required to relocate again subject to where she may be deployed for duty, and (c) at the time of the hearing the mother’s proposal was “somewhat inchoate”.   at the time of the hearing the mother’s proposal was “somewhat inchoate”.
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative)
the regular and meaningful time spent with both parents appears to work well to ameliorate the negative impacts of the parents’ separation. children of separated parents with whom they share regular and meaningful relationships experience better outcomes than children who do not.   and [y] are both of an age where they require their significant care givers to be regularly and consistently present to maintain a quality relationship. children of [x] and [y]’s respective ages are more concrete in their thinking and particularly so with regards to time. their focus is on the ‘here and now’ – and a relationship with an absent caregiver may weaken and at worse be forgotten.
it’s risky but with – with it being so heavily considered by myself and the – the attention that i pay to their emotional and physical and – and psychological needs, i’m – i’m very attuned to the needs of the children and it would be a matter of supporting them – them through it and, as i say, encouraging that resilience and making it an adventure and – and – and changing the mindset to it all. it doesn’t have to be a shocking, horrific, detrimental event in their life. it could be the commencement of a – a new and exciting chapter where, yes, things have changed but it – it will find its level and, hopefully, [mr talsma] and i will be able to work together to continue to do the best for the children.[53]
i agree that a move for – for any person, child or adult, can be a – a stressful situation. but again the responsibility falls down to [mr talsma] and i to guide and support the children through that and assist with their – their perspective on how they – they see it. if it’s sold to them as a terrible tragedy, well, then they will – they will pick up on that.[54]  e mother] demonstrates planning and consideration of the boys’ life in [city b] and how their educational needs will be met. such planning and forethought would assist [x] and [y] with setting some expectations and adjusting with more ease to aspects of a relocation if so permitted. .[55]
the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis f it were otherwise, it would follow axiomatically that courts exercising jurisdiction under part vii of the act would not only likely prevent any proposed relocation of any parent in cases where that issue arises, but the court would routinely order restraints or injunctions interfering with the parental rights to which we have referred so that “reasonable practicability” (by requiring parents to live proximate to each other) was achieved and maintained.
any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant
one of the objects of modern family law statutes (including fla 1975 and fca 1975) is to enable parties to a broken relationship to start a new life for themselves, to control their own future destinies and, where desired, to form new relationships, free from unnecessary interference from a former spouse or partner or from a court. courts recognise that unwarranted interference in the life of a custodial parent may itself occasion bitterness towards the former spouse or partner which may be transmitted to the child or otherwise impinge on the happiness of the custodial (or residence) parent in a way likely to affect the welfare or best interests of the child. this said, the touchstone for the ultimate decision must remain the welfare or best interests of the child and not, as such, the wishes and interests of the parents. the paramount consideration of the child’s best interests must be weighed and balanced against that right.
it will be she, not the husband, who will usually be confined, in effect, in her personal movements, emotional environment, employment opportunities and chances of remarriage, repartnering and reparenting. effectively, as here, it is she who will be controlled by court orders that require her to live, and make the most of her life, in physical proximity to the husband's whereabouts. in this way, inconvenience to the husband is minimised. but the effect on the wife may be profound. as has been noted by this court and courts in other jurisdictions, significant effects on the mother's emotional, residential, economic, employment and personal life have an inevitable impact on the happiness and best interests of the child.
courts, exercising such discretions, should not ignore the disproportionate burden typically cast upon women by their being effectively immobilised as the custodial/residence parent.
