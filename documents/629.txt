...i did not force him ... you didn’t want him there [ms mccormack]... get [mr y] to help get [mr y] to help get [mr y] to help. so i sent him to [mr y’s] and he fucking died... because he’s an incompetent cunt. so how is that my fault? i looked ... i helped look after him for 4 years. because you cried and bitched and fuckin’ complained for so long it wasn’t funny... i did not. and then made a big deal and said “we were the ones that looked after him... fuck you [mr y], we looked after him”... all i asked for was some help once in a blue moon so we could have a break every now and then ... after 4 years ... yes, so i sent him off so i could fucking propose, that’s why i sent him off and then he’s fucking died ... so then i had to wait and still follow through... and if it wasn’t for him, i would have fucking regretted the whole lot. (clinking noise) like i told you a thousand times before ... everything for him ... it had to happen ... now ... don’t give a fuck... i was... you got my messages... i wanted to... and i don’t know if this is just some ruse to get the gun taken because of your paranoid-arsed parents... (child whinges) i didn’t even bring it up [mr madar]... that’s not ... i didn’t do this at all... well why did she even fucking ask, [ms mccormack]? unless you made it out that i was a violent person... it’s just a standard ... honestly, a standard question they ask, i don’t know... oh ... okay ... derr, my husband’s ... argues with me once in a while ... uh, but does he have a weapon? could’ve fucking killed her? ... i’ve got a weapon [ms mccormack] ...

(more noise ... cutlery being dropped, cutlery drawer being slammed shut) instead you take an ornamental gun that doesn’t even have a fucking firing pin in it... i didn’t try to do anything with that ... i ... well they’re fucking cluey cunts because i could poison you with shit! (child cries) if i really wanted to fucking do it ... (child cries) (in the background, different voice: better go) (child cries, rattle) there’s nothing there ... because you haven’t been buying anything ... (clinking noise of something being dropped) ... it’s like you’ve had this shit planned for fucking months ...

im not saying you have to go to work in the sence of going to it and leaving him. i mean take advantage or the opportunity of them offering to work from home. yiu can do 10-20 a week from home easy you go help your mum for 5 hours when she wants you to but you wont help pay for the house you live in. be reasonable. not only that you could save me 4000 by doing my tax. sending me to [ms af] is [mr ag] me telling you to get a [tradesman] in to fix something. if you cant see that or even want to help so i don’t blow my brains out then there is no point i would rather pay child support and just make my income nothing so i pay fuck all. ... or you can just milk it more and i will kill myself and then your fuck either way.

...benefit from ongoing psychological support to assist her in managing the stress and anxiety she experiences in response to the current family court situation, the maintenance of her security regarding her current place of residence and employment and the structures in place for ongoing contact between [x] and [mr madar].[12]
...particularly associated with the history of her relationship with [mr madar]. her mental health function has been excacerbated by ongoing communication between herself and [mr madar] via a communication app they use to discuss [x], changes she has experienced at handovers of [x] for contact visits with [mr madar] and the current family court proceedings.[13]
behaviours of manipulation and control, belittling of [ms mccormack], and criticisms of her appearance, her parenting, her family of origin and her role as a wife. all of which resulted in negative impacts on [ms mccormack’s] psychological wellbeing, particularly regarding her self esteem and self confidence.
...the support she receives within her current relationship with [mr e], her current employment as [a finance professional] with [employer ak], her relocation to [town c] and establishment of connections and positive relationships within the country community...[14]
...there is valid concern that ongoing exposure to behaviours reportedly exhibited by [mr madar] will continue to impact upon [ms mccormack]’s psychological wellbeing. perpetrators of coercive control commonly continue to attempt to exert control over their ex partners via a range of strategies such as criticism of their parenting, criticism of the other parent to the child during contact visits, demands for alternations to contact visits and returning children after the scheduled/agreed upon return time after contact visits.[15]
stability, safety and security are particularly necessary for the recovery of psychological wellbeing post traumatic experiences. [ms mccormack]’s current living arrangements have provided the opportunity for her to experience increased stability and security within her relationship with [mr e], within her employment role, as a member of the country community, and via her connections and relationships she has established through local sports and establishing a play group with other mothers who reside in the [town c] region. [ms mccormack] displayed evidence of improved psychological function when she experienced a period of stability as a result of her relationship moving forward with the purchase of a home in [town c] and [mr e], and her acquisition of stabilised employment. disruption to her psychological wellbeing became evident once the mediation process was unsuccessful and a trial date was set for the current family court process. it is believed that a forced relocation will hold significant negative impacts upon [ms mccormack]’s wellbeing.[16]
...the loss of relationships and connections she has established...will also hold negative impacts upon [ms mccormack]’s psychological wellbeing. the loss of stability, security and safety that she has developed over the past 2 years is likely to have far reaching negative impacts for her emotional function.[17]   mccormack]’s relocation to [town c] has proven to be highly beneficial to her psychological wellbeing. [ms mccormack] has developed positive relationships with [mr e’s] family (all of whom reside in [town c] and almost all work on the family farm). [ms mccormack] has also reported that [x] has developed positive relationships with the family, shares a close bond with [mr e], and has responded well to farm and country life”.[18]
ms m
recommendations in light of the discussion above, it was recommended that: [x] continue to reside with his mother in [town c]. [x] continue to spend time as currently ordered with his father. from the age of 4 years, as long as [x] has weaned from being breastfed and can either sleep through the night or can self-settle/be settled without breastfeeding, overnights commence. from that time, [x] spend time with his father on alternate weekends, with overnights increasing at a rate of a further overnight every 6 months until alternate fridays to mondays are reached. intervening wednesday visits to remain, to occur in [town c]. handover eventually to be shared between [city b] and [town c]. handover arrangements should limit direct contact between the parties. [ms mccormack] to be awarded sole parental responsibility. [mr madar] continue to engage with [mr h] until at least alternate fridays to monday time is well established.

the mother’s proposed relocation
whilst the statutory framework does not deal differently or specifically with cases involving a proposed relocation from other parenting cases, such cases attract the description of “relocation cases” because they bring into sharp focus the central issue of balancing statutory imperatives concerning children’s best interests in the context of the legitimate and competing interests of parents. the task is to achieve, by the application of the law, orders which are legitimate by reference to both “best interests” considerations and the rights of parents, including a right to choose where the parent lives. in some cases, the determination of “best interests” may well mean that one party’s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child’s “best interests” being served by orders which do not give one parent “optimal” arrangements or outcomes.[30]
parental responsibility  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
note: the presumption provided for in this subsection is a presumption that relates solely to the allocation of parental responsibility for a child as defined in section 61b. it does not provide for a presumption about the amount of time the child spends with each of the parents (this issue is dealt with in section 65daa).   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent's family (or that other person's family), or   family violence.   when the court is making an interim order, the presumption applies unless the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order. (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.[34]   the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child's parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.[34]   for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person's family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful. (2) examples of behaviour that may constitute family violence include (but are not limited to): (a) an assault, or (b) a sexual assault or other sexually abusive behaviour, or (c) stalking, or (d) repeated derogatory taunts, or (e) intentionally damaging or destroying property, or (f) intentionally causing death or injury to an animal, or (g) unreasonably denying the family member the financial autonomy that he or she would otherwise have had, or (h) unreasonably withholding financial support needed to meet the reasonable living expenses of the family member, or his or her child, at a time when the family member is entirely or predominantly dependent on the person for financial support, or (i) preventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture, or (j) unlawfully depriving the family member, or any member of the family member's family, of his or her liberty. (3) for the purposes of this act, a child is exposed to family violence if the child sees or hears family violence or otherwise experiences the effects of family violence.
