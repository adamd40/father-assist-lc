the applicable law – parenting proceedings   assess whether that risk is an acceptable risk or an unacceptable risk, (2) if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   in re andrew the full court observed that the welfare of the child remains the paramount consideration and in considering such welfare, the court must take into account any anxiety held by the primary carer concerning the child’s potential harm where such anxiety is likely to adversely impact that person’s care-giving ability. in taking account of the beliefs of the primary carer and the effects of such beliefs on that person and the consequent harm to the child, a subjective test is required. (b) however it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: r & c. (c) a decision to sever the relationship between a parent and a child is one which the court would ordinarily make only with considerable hesitation: sedgley (d) it is only in cases where a conclusion is reached that there was no unacceptable risk that the court would need to consider the separate question of the primary carer’s belief in the occurrence of events in question: r & c. (e) it is not necessary that the belief should be reasonably and objectively based, but rather whether it is genuinely held: r & c. (f) despite no apparent expert evidence in support of the primary carer’s apprehension, the full court in dunst & dunst [2016] famcafc 15 at [119] did not criticise the trial judge for concluding that whilst the available evidence fell short of proving the primary carer’s capacity would deteriorate and impinge the children’s best interest (there having been a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (‘ptsd’) and expert evidence of the genuineness of the apprehension but not about such apprehension impinging capacity), the trial judge nonetheless found that the primary carer’s fear was genuine and objectively reasonable and remained a feature of the evidence favouring curtailment of the children’s interaction with the other party. (g) the court has made a “no time” order in circumstances where the psychological evidence was that if time or communication was ordered, the mother’s already poor mental health would deteriorate further and negatively affect her parenting capacity and that further treatment would not diminish her fear: gallagher & gomez [2017] famca 944 at [142]- [157], (h) in the decision of hollister & gosselin [2016] famca 759, the court did not make a “no time” order because the court found at [193] that, there was little evidence, beyond the mother’s inevitable devastation and horror, to suggest that she could not continue to successfully parent the children. notably in that case, the trial judge observed that there was no evidence from her psychologist or counsellor, much less a psychiatrist, as to her likely being unable to continue to function effectively so as to adequately care for the children.   however it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: r & c. (c) a decision to sever the relationship between a parent and a child is one which the court would ordinarily make only with considerable hesitation: sedgley (d) it is only in cases where a conclusion is reached that there was no unacceptable risk that the court would need to consider the separate question of the primary carer’s belief in the occurrence of events in question: r & c.

it was pitch-black, mum. i thought we were going to die. the way dad pulled over was so dangerous i was so frightened[4].
i can’t, mum. he’s just too scary. i can’t stand-up to him[5].   shared that she is currently worried about her [animals] which are at (the father’s) home, and [x] is concerned about dad’s reaction when [x] suggested they may need to be put down. she is concerned the father will get angry. she described the father’s anger to consist of yelling and shouting. (the father) is understood to escalate to the point of needing to leave contact once a week or fortnight. [x] reports the paternal aunt ([ms n]) and the uncle (which is [mr m]) who were acting as supervisors at the time do not intervene and sometimes “join in and gang up on us” referring to her and her brother [y]. (she is recorded as saying she) feels scared and nervous when the same is occurring. [x] expressed she would like the supervisors to stop dad and feels relieved contact will be moved to an independent supervisor.   ayton] (as in the mother), doesn’t have any concerns for [y’s] behaviour. shared he is much better at regulating his big feelings now, and [ms ayton] has developed strategies to help him manage his big feelings.
“what have you been telling your mother about me and what i do? you need to tell her you want sleepovers,”
and this is a conversation y is hearing his father have with x-
“this has gone on long enough. you are not scared of me. you just need to suck it up. you need to get over it. don’t tell your mother anything. she will write it all down in her little book and then i will get in trouble. she will take you away from me.”   x is in year 6 at r school in region s, (b) x presented as extremely friendly, bright and polite, (c) the mother sees x as missing her old dad

received the covid-19 vaccination, she would die, but that she would kind of want the vaccine so she could travel. when asked how she felt the father might respond if she did receive the vaccine, she replied, “he’ll rage”, (f) x described her dad as a big man, scary to talk to if cranky, (g) x said that her dad will “go on about stuff” and gave the example of not being allowed to put on sunscreen when she is with the father and, on one occasion, the father’s reaction to the topic was such that she and her brother both cried, (h) in addition to reporting about the early 2021 incident, x disclosed another incident where the father sustained a large cut to his head and had to go to hospital due to a physical fight with ms d. x recounted that she had witnessed the father and ms d fighting 10 or 15 times, (i) x described her father as very funny, kind, good when he is good and that “he cuddles us” and that she would love it if he stops going on about stuff, (j) x described that at times the father makes her feel scared when he goes on or is cranky and described that she experiences anxiety at times because she feels sick, gets upset at night and will have a sad tantrum where she is just bawling her eyes out but does not know why, (k) x said she would like to spend 25 or 30 per cent of her time with her dad, that she was comfortable with him and said that if she became uncomfortable or unhappy or felt unsafe with her father and asked to go back to her mum’s, her father would say no.   x presented as extremely friendly, bright and polite, (c) the mother sees x as

conclusion – parenting proceedings  firstly, face-to-face time would only occur four times a year and only until x turns 14, so the quantum is eight visits in just under two years, (b) secondly, face-to-face time would be conducted by a professional supervisor who can terminate the time at their discretion, noting that: (i) to date, (in the main) the children have enjoyed their time with the father in this setting, with x wanting the visits to go longer. i make this finding noting that the child expert had reservations about the veracity of their presentation which potentially could have been at a superficial level only, (ii) there is a risk of emotional harm to the children from no longer seeing their father, given they both want to do so provided it is safe, (iii) the mother acknowledges that she would be comfortable with a regime of six supervised sessions per year, (iv) the risk of non-compliance by the father with the various restraints underpinning time is limited because a supervisor is there and there are limited occasions when the visits would happen, which would coincide to some extent with special occasions that children would ordinarily expect to have some sort of contact with a parent, (v) and, finally, x would not feel the need to continue acting in a hyper-vigilant way, (for example, covertly looking at the father’s phone, passing feedback to the mother and worrying about ms d returning) because a supervisor is present at all times to keep her (and her brother) safe. (c) thirdly, there would be no spontaneous contact or communication between the father and either the mother and/or the children - it will not be countenanced - with the potential for the father to be arrested without warrant in certain circumstances. this lack of any unsupervised, spontaneous contact means that the children will get the benefit of continuing to see their “good dad” and derive pleasure from seeking out his praise for their efforts whilst not exposing them to the father’s emotional dysregulation, including his perseveration and impulsivity. (d) fourthly, by the time the supervision finishes, x will have reached an age where she will find the regime awkward and artificial, and the father will have had enough opportunity to secure their relationships with him into the future which would be supported by the ongoing written communication they can have with him (even if the mother does not exercise her discretion post-august 2024 for the children to see their father in person). given the close relationships between the children and the comfort they find in having the other with them when seeing their dad, i considered, then rejected, the notion of extending supervised time only for y. (e) finally, the benefit to the mother (and her parenting capacity) is that no longer will she have the children coming home reporting on what the father has said or done when he was supposed to be supervised by his family. in addition, there will be zero spontaneous communication with him except in some very limited circumstances and even less than the mother sought in her own relief. she will be able to vet the written communication he sends to the children – something she consented to,   secondly, face-to-face time would be conducted by a professional supervisor who can terminate the time at their discretion, noting that: (i) to date, (in the main) the children have enjoyed their time with the father in this setting, with x wanting the visits to go longer. i make this finding noting that the child expert had reservations about the veracity of their presentation which potentially could have been at a superficial level only, (ii) there is a risk of emotional harm to the children from no longer seeing their father, given they both want to do so provided it is safe, (iii) the mother acknowledges that she would be comfortable with a regime of six supervised sessions per year, (iv) the risk of non-compliance by the father with the various restraints underpinning time is limited because a supervisor is there and there are limited occasions when the visits would happen, which would coincide to some extent with special occasions that children would ordinarily expect to have some sort of contact with a parent, (v) and, finally, x would not feel the need to continue acting in a hyper-vigilant way, (for example, covertly looking at the father’s phone, passing feedback to the mother and worrying about ms d returning) because a supervisor is present at all times to keep her (and her brother) safe.
