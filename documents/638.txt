is it just and equitable that an order be made?
... is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.
section 79(4)
weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties or provide for a transfer of property in specie in accordance with that assessment.
the judge must weigh up various areas of contribution. in a short marriage, significant weight might be given to a large capital contribution. in a long marriage, other factors often assume great significance and ought not be left almost unseen by eyes dazzled by the magnitude of recently acquired capital... what is important is to somehow give a reasonable value to all of the elements that go to making up the entirety of the marriage relationship.
... the task of the court in proceedings under s 79 is not akin to an accounting exercise. the task is to examine the facts of each case carefully to decide what is appropriate and just and equitable in the circumstances. there cannot be expected to be a universal answer to that question on any given set of facts. it is of the essence of judicial discretion that different minds may comfortably arrive at different conclusions.

child support departure
whilst it is not possible to define with precision the meaning of that term, as agenerality, it is intended to emphasize that the facts of the case must establish something which is special or out of the ordinary. that is, the intention of the legislature is that the court will not interfere with the administrative formula result in the ordinary run of cases. in savery’s case (p 77,897), kay j, adopting the view in philippe and philippe (1978) flc 90–433 at p 77,202 in a different context, said that “special circumstances” were “facts peculiar to the particular case which set it apart from other cases”.   due to the husband’s income and his ability to structure his affairs to minimise taxation, (ii) the parties were engaged in complex property proceedings, requiring the court to conduct a detailed exploration of their financial affairs, and (iii) should the court not deal with the issue the parties were likely to end up pursuing the issue in a different forum, resulting in further proceedings and costs.  ) the parties were engaged in complex property proceedings, requiring the court to conduct a detailed exploration of their financial affairs, and (iii) should the court not deal with the issue the parties were likely to end up pursuing the issue in a different forum, resulting in further proceedings and costs.  i) should the court not deal with the issue the parties were likely to end up pursuing the issue in a different forum, resulting in further proceedings and costs.   whether one or more grounds of departure in s 117(2) of the csa act is established, (ii) whether it is “just and equitable” within the meaning of s 117(4) of the csa act to make a particular order, and (iii) whether it is “otherwise proper” within the meaning of s 117(5) of the csa act to make a particular order.  ) whether it is “just and equitable” within the meaning of s 117(4) of the csa act to make a particular order, and (iii) whether it is “otherwise proper” within the meaning of s 117(5) of the csa act to make a particular order.  i) whether it is “otherwise proper” within the meaning of s 117(5) of the csa act to make a particular order.
117 matters as to which court must be satisfied before making order   that, in the special circumstances of the case, application in relation to the child of the provisions of this act relating to administrative assessment of child support would result in an unjust and inequitable determination of the level of financial support to be provided by the liable parent for the child: (ia) because of the income, property and financial resources of either parent, or  ) because of the income, property and financial resources of either parent, or  ) because of the earning capacity of either parent.
