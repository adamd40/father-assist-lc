witnesses are supposed to answer questions put by counsel responsively: they are supposed to give a full answer, but no more. it is one thing to say that a witness was not asked the right questions. it is another thing to say that a witness did not answer the questions that were asked. and it is an even more serious thing to say that a witness was “reluctant” to answer. the duty of a witness is to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth so far as the questions asked seek it. the duty of a witness to answer questions responsively involves not only a negative duty (not to volunteer material for which the question does not call), but also a positive duty (to proffer all material within the witness’s knowledge for which the question does call).

primary considerations
meaningful relationship age removed]
mother: do you love mummy? child: yes mother: do you love papa? child: no mother: why? child: inaudible mother: you don’t want a daddy?
during september and october 2019, i started to notice [x] return from contact with a heavily soiled nappy and that he looked dirty. i recall seeing him return from contact with a bruise on his head that had not been there when i dropped him off. this increased my concern about [x]’s safety with [mr ramzi]. at this time i stopped taking [x] to changeover.
i thought my safety and the safety of my child was somewhat compromised and so that was the main reason that i did not comply. i also understood the consequences of not complying with those court orders. i understood that. i was fully aware of it. but again, my safety and the safety of my child was the most important thing for me, more than anything else.   held onto [mr ramzi], it seemed there were more things he wanted to do and did not want to leave. [mr ramzi] reassured [x] that they would see each other again soon and would do more things next time. [x] and [mr ramzi] embraced goodbye, [mr ramzi] kissed him and they said they loved each other.[13]
it may be highly beneficial to [x]’s emotional wellbeing, his development of his sense of identity, and he may benefit from the supports and resources his father can provide him, if he is given the opportunity to spend time with, and develop a relationship with, his father.[14]
discussion of risk
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary...sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment (edwards v noble (1971) 125 clr 296 at 304), though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result (norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513 at 518). the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s 60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.
risks alleged about the mother
risks alleged about the father  x has been, and will be, exposed to family violence, (b) the father has engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour, and (c) orders allowing contact between x and the father may pose a risk to the mother’s parenting capacity.   the father has engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour, and (c) orders allowing contact between x and the father may pose a risk to the mother’s parenting capacity.   orders allowing contact between x and the father may pose a risk to the mother’s parenting capacity.
family violence
coercive and controlling family violence
for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful. (emphasis added)
1. to exercise restraint or direction over, dominate, command the phrase ‘coerces or controls’ is expressed disjunctively. however it may be seen that the two concepts are closely related. together they form an expanded concept of the exercise of power, to restrain another or to cause another to act, by force, domination or command.
1. physical violence and harm

(b) on 10 november 2016, the mother attended a routine check-up at suburb v health centre. she was aided by a country f interpreter. she informed social workers and antenatal care staff that the father had asked her to leave because he wanted to re-marry and have a new wife. when asked about family violence, she confirmed that the father had hit her several times on several occasions across the stomach.[19] she was connected to safe steps and arrangements were made for her to access crisis accommodation. the note also recorded that “her in-laws are aware of the situation but are not able to offer any support and say they are sorry for what is happening”.[20] (c) the records from safe steps confirm that on 10 november 2016, arrangements were made for the mother to receive immediate protection. she specifically reported that she was fearful to return home “due to a f/v incident which occurred 5 days ago, this resulted in the woman needing to seek medical attention as she was hit in the stomach and is 7 months pregnant”.[21] notes from the mother’s consultations with a social worker at safe steps also indicate that she disclosed that the father had made threats to her mother in country f, and that the father “has threatened to kill the child, and out [sic] it through hell when it is born”.[22] (d) a report was made to the dhhs on 11 november 2016 but was closed as there were “no concerns identified about [the mother’s] ability to seek out family violence support services”.[23] (e) on 16 november 2016, the p hospital prepared a client at risk management plan for the mother which included a report to child protection services and a referral to safe steps. the record corroborates that the mother informed the hospital social worker that there had been incidences of verbal and physical abuse from the father towards her, including being hit across the stomach when pregnant on two occasions. the notes also record that the mother reported being under pressure from her family to return to the relationship with the father.

(i) records from safe steps support the mother’s assertion that she was concerned that she was being followed and her movements monitored by the father and family members. for example, when she sought their assistance in 2016, their notes recorded that she had “barred all perp’s family contacts form [sic] her phone as they have been trying to contact woman [sic]”.[26] records from safe steps also confirm that the mother was assisted to receive centrelink payments in late 2016.

(iv) that there were ongoing physical and verbal assaults throughout the relationship. (v) that when the mother was seven months pregnant, the father physically assaulted her, kicking her in the stomach and slapping her on the face, causing her to be concerned for the baby’s safety. (vi) that the relationship was characterised by violent behaviour, including that the father had “threatened to harm me, threatened to kill me, sexual abuse, obsession/jealous behaviours, controlling, thrown things at me, and has physically assaulted me many times”.[32] (m) on 7 december 2017, a report was made to dhhs raising concerns that the father had applied to have x removed from the ivo, and that this would potentially place x at risk of harm.

what findings can the court make about the existence of family violence?
this binary view of family violence is outmoded and has no place in modern family law. in our view her evidence that she sought to preserve the family unit and to protect z without the involvement of these agencies was neither incredible nor inconsistent with her evidence of her history of family violence.
inconsistency having thus been established, the totality of the evidence as to family violence was then evaluated as unreliable. no attempt was made to identify a core consistency in what she said. amongst other things, this approach fails to recognise how hard it is for victims of violence inflicted by a family member, who is often someone they love or on whom they rely for sustenance, to speak about what has happened. the subject matter is distressing and giving voice to what has occurred can be traumatic in itself. we cannot say strongly enough that those involved in cases such as this must bear in mind that in this setting, disclosure is a process that often requires time before a complete picture emerges.  he probative value of a particular piece of evidence should not be considered in isolation from the rest of the evidence, including the proposed evidence. this is particularly so where the court is asked to draw an inference from all of the evidence, that is to say, all of the circumstances of the matter. this is because one piece of evidence may affect the probative value of another and a number of pieces of evidence when considered together may have a probative value greater than if each is considered individually.   an affidavit by his mother who appears to have been involved in several of the incidents of family violence alleged by the mother and therefore could have corroborated the father’s version of events.

(b) evidence regarding the impact of the mother’s culture on both her ability to understand and identify the behaviours complained of as family violence, and give instructions to her lawyers and the court via male interpreters about sexual violence and other sensitive matters.   evidence regarding the impact of the mother’s culture on both her ability to understand and identify the behaviours complained of as family violence, and give instructions to her lawyers and the court via male interpreters about sexual violence and other sensitive matters.   the mother makes various allegations throughout her affidavit that during her pregnancy, she was hit or kicked in the stomach by the father. she says that she visited the hospital on several occasions to ensure the baby was still alive. documents before the court indicated that the mother did present at the emergency department of the p hospital on 23 june 2016 in the company of the father who was there to translate. the record indicates that she was 11 weeks pregnant and complained that she had hit her abdomen after she tripped and fell. this seems consistent with the mother’s account of attending the emergency department after being hit in the stomach by the father in the early stages of her pregnancy. (b) the mother has consistently asserted that when she was around seven months pregnant, she was locked in the house and denied food. she says she escaped and purchased food, but was then physically assaulted by the father. i make the following observations regarding the evidence surrounding these allegations: (i) the father asserted that her account should not be accepted because the house did not have a remote control garage door and the mother had her own keys to the home. the mother deposes to words being interpreted differently by the various interpreters she has used, and i accept that this might be an example of a description being lost in translation. (ii) the mother deposed attending on the p hospital for a check-up without the father after the alleged assault. there is no record of this. she did however attend a routine check-up alone shortly after this on 10 november 2016 at which time she disclosed family violence consistent with the descriptions that she has given for this and previous incidents of family violence.[46] at that appointment, she reported the incident and that she had sought medical attention.[47] (c) on 19 december 2016, the mother alleges that on her way home from visiting the hospital for a routine check-up, she was injured when she was required by the father to exit suddenly from a moving car. she returned to the hospital, and using the father as an interpreter, told staff that she had tripped and fallen at the shopping plaza. while her accounts of this incident are consistent, the hospital records show that she denied the injuries arose from an incident of family violence. the progress notes observe that she “denies being pushed by someone else”, “discussed her fall and whether she felt safe to go home with partner” and that the mother reported “one incidence of physical abuse from her partner 1 month ago when he hit her in the abdomen. [the mother] states he has never hit her again and that he apologised and said he didn’t mean to. [the mother] states that she tripped and fell on her abdomen while walking in al shopping centre today”.[48]   the mother has consistently asserted that when she was around seven months pregnant, she was locked in the house and denied food. she says she escaped and purchased food, but was then physically assaulted by the father. i make the following observations regarding the evidence surrounding these allegations: (i) the father asserted that her account should not be accepted because the house did not have a remote control garage door and the mother had her own keys to the home. the mother deposes to words being interpreted differently by the various interpreters she has used, and i accept that this might be an example of a description being lost in translation.

conclusions regarding coercive and controlling family violence  the mother appears to have at least flagged a range of family violence concerns on 18 october 2017 when she sought an ivo against the father, and later on 8 january 2018 when she provided further particulars to the police. (b) letters from support services confirm that they had provided the mother with support in relation to family violence since 2017. (c) the mother began disclosing her safety concerns to external agencies during her pregnancy in 2016. the lack of an exact note about a particular incident does not mean that it was not raised. (d) there are some specific individual characteristics in this matter that lead me to place less weight on inconsistent versions of events given by the mother. english was not the mother’s first language. she was poorly educated. she spoke through an interpreter. i cannot be satisfied she would have understood how domestic and family violence is defined in australia. (e) ms o was asked to comment on the mother’s disclosures of family violence post-separation with the support of safe steps. she was of the view that is was not unusual for victims of family violence, once supported, to recall and disclose a long history of behaviour.   letters from support services confirm that they had provided the mother with support in relation to family violence since 2017.

(b) in contrast, the father’s evidence consisted of blanket denials. he provided no context for incidents that the mother described and gave no plausible explanations or alternative accounts. for example: (i) regarding the circumstances surrounding the mother’s second examination by the p hospital on 19 december 2016, the father was unable to provide any details about the incident. his mother came to join them at the hospital, but was not called to give evidence. (ii) the father said he had no recollection of what caused the mother to leave him, on foot and at night, when she was seven months pregnant in november 2016. he could not explain why the mother was housed in crisis accommodation. whilst he denied any family violence, he provided no insight into what had taken place to cause the mother to leave in the manner in which she did. (iii) when asked why the mother had left the matrimonial home when x was three days old to stay with ms w, he offered that it was a “cultural thing.” however, he did not depose the particulars of the cultural practice itself in his affidavit or in his oral evidence. (iv) his evidence about the alleged incident on 8 august 2017 was also vague. he disagreed with the mother’s account of the events and offered that he called her from his car, asked for a divorce and then did not return for several weeks until she had vacated the property. as already noted, the only explanation offered by the father about their troubled relationship was that he told the mother before she fell pregnant that the relationship was not strong and from that point, she started threatening him. (c) the mother’s behaviour, decisions and responses to the father and his conduct need to be seen in the context of her personal and cultural background, as well as her values and beliefs. she was around 18 when she arrived in country r from rural country f. when she arrived in australia, her english was limited. her marriage occurred in a manner consistent with customary practice in country f, where i accept that she had not been consulted, and indeed was not present. the father likely had an expectation that she would be “obedient” and this included fulfilling and participating in all activities that he requested of her, including sexual intercourse. (d) ms o gave evidence about the cyclical nature of family violence. in the context of her evidence, the following behaviours could be understood as part of the “cycles of violence”, and should not be viewed as inconsistent with her allegations: (i) that she sent loving messages to the father in the early (“honeymoon”) stages of the marriage. (ii) her delay in speaking about or reporting the violence and abuse to anyone outside of the family for several years. (iii) the misleading accounts she gave of incidents and the father’s behaviour and his conduct whilst the marriage was on foot. (iv) her disclosures to other agencies that the father had “apologised” for his behaviour. (v) that she felt upset about the father’s disclosure that “he wanted a divorce”. (vi) that when the father refused to allow the mother to travel to country f with x, she offered that x could be cared for by the father for a period of five weeks. (e) the mother has been consistent about her reports of family violence. for example, ms o observed that when the family violence screening was completed during interviews for the family report, the mother became “teary when recounting the abuse she describes”.[50] (f) the definition of family violence provided in section 4ab of the act contains ten examples of behaviour that may constitute family violence. the mother’s account of the relationship includes nine of these examples. the mother gave accounts of the family violence which included most of these examples from as early as 18 october 2017 when she sought an ivo against the father. this was 12 months before these proceedings commenced. (g) as a result of different family violence behaviours alleged by the mother, especially during pregnancy, several external agencies applied risk assessment tools that rated her risk levels as “high” or “extremely high.” (h) the mother’s limited literacy, education level and proficiency in english make the father’s contentions that her various accounts of family violence are “fantasy” implausible.   in contrast, the father’s evidence consisted of blanket denials. he provided no context for incidents that the mother described and gave no plausible explanations or alternative accounts. for example: (i) regarding the circumstances surrounding the mother’s second examination by the p hospital on 19 december 2016, the father was unable to provide any details about the incident. his mother came to join them at the hospital, but was not called to give evidence.

findings regarding coercive and controlling family violence  there is ample independent evidence from other agencies that support the mother’s contentions, as already discussed. (b) the father could not explain why he applied for an ivo against the mother on the same day that he was served the mother’s application to vary her ivo, especially when the last “harassing” message was allegedly received in september 2018. furthermore, he provided no evidence to support the allegations contained in his application and summons for intervention order which leaves the court to conclude that it was a retaliatory, and threatening action.

did the father engage in behaviour that caused the mother to be fearful?
for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful. (emphasis in original)
...to be clear, family violence as defined in the act does not need to be coercive or controlling (although it may be), if there is violent, threatening or other behaviour that causes a family member to be fearful. or, alternatively, such behaviour that coerces or controls a person will constitute family violence. hence, the examples that are given in s 4ab subsection (2) which give context to the meaning of subsection (1).
the mother’s argument  she was fearful of the father and mr t in country r, (b) after she received the call from the father post-separation, she felt “so fearful that i called 000.” (c) seeing the father in the suburb g area made her “feel fearful, anxious and afraid.” because the mother “felt afraid all of the time” that the father would continue to follow her or harm her and x, she contacted amwchr and installed safety cameras. (d) the mother deposes that she continues “to live in extreme fear of mr ramzi.”   after she received the call from the father post-separation, she felt “so fearful that i called 000.” (c) seeing the father in the suburb g area made her “feel fearful, anxious and afraid.” because the mother “felt afraid all of the time” that the father would continue to follow her or harm her and x, she contacted amwchr and installed safety cameras.

(d) the mother deposes that she continues “to live in extreme fear of mr ramzi.”   the mother deposes that she continues “to live in extreme fear of mr ramzi.”
the father’s argument
conclusions about fear  at the commencement of the relationship, the mother was a young woman with limited education, english and worldly experience. she was dependent upon the father for his support in most aspects of her life. this set the groundwork for a relationship defined by power and control and impacted on all aspects of the mother’s life including her ability to travel, enjoy financial independence and communicate with friends and family. (b) it is not surprising that in the early stages of the relationship the mother sent romantic messages to the father in the hope that deep love and affection would grow between them. the existence of such messages does not disprove that she lived in fear of the father. (c) the father’s argument that the mother’s behaviour is influenced by her desire to deny him a relationship with x, rather than fear, overlooks that the mother has been consistent in expressing her fears about her and x’s safety for an extended period of time. in fact, the mother’s failure to engage with parenting arrangements and court processes is perhaps itself reflective of the ongoing fears that she held for her safety.   it is not surprising that in the early stages of the relationship the mother sent romantic messages to the father in the hope that deep love and affection would grow between them. the existence of such messages does not disprove that she lived in fear of the father.

the mother explained her non-compliance with the spend time arrangements by reference to her allegations that x returned from contact dirty, and on one occasion, bruised in september and october 2019. however, there was nothing before the court to support this allegation. this was not an honest account by the mother, and did not justify a cessation of the father’s time with x. however it is viewed as being the consequence of the profoundly negative, fearful and distrustful view the mother formed of the father.   as already discussed, the father had reason to be in the suburb g area on a regular basis in 2018 and 2019 as alleged by the mother. although unable to make any findings as to whether the father intentionally or deliberately observed the mother and x, the court cannot discount that the mother did see the father in her local area and this caused her to fear for her safety. (e) while the father had limited personal contact with the mother from late 2017 onwards, he continued to exercise power and control which caused her to be fearful. as already discussed, examples of this included his constant communication with her family members and his shifting responsibility for the family violence that occurred by applying for an ivo in circumstances where he could not possibly have been fearful of the mother. (f) there is evidence from many agencies (such as amwchr, the police, dhhs, and safe steps), including risk assessment processes completed from 2016 to 2019, that corroborate that the mother was expressing repeated and consistent concerns for her safety. (g) the mother’s fear for her safety led to her fleeing to sydney with x, leaving her furniture, car and all other possessions in melbourne. on arrival she went straight to the suburb am police station to seek assistance and was referred to ah service who arranged crisis accommodation.   while the father had limited personal contact with the mother from late 2017 onwards, he continued to exercise power and control which caused her to be fearful. as already discussed, examples of this included his constant communication with her family members and his shifting responsibility for the family violence that occurred by applying for an ivo in circumstances where he could not possibly have been fearful of the mother.

does the father pose an unacceptable risk to the child?
every child is entitled to be kept safe from harm. precautions must be proportionate to the harm identified. it does not follow that a cessation of time is reserved only for perpetrators of physically life threatening violence.
can the risk be ameliorated?
even in the event, if there is no risk to his safety with the father, it is going to be a really complicated situation for him to spend time with his father because there is such animosity between the mother and the father and father’s family. if say one of dad’s family members sends mum a message saying you’re awful – then suddenly she’s anxious, she’s depressed, she’s distracted when she should be caring for [x] or not being able to give him the best home life experience. at some point you wonder do we let him off the hook? is his life going to be a lot more calmer, peaceful if it’s him with his mother without her experiencing conflict and hostility that might be persistent and quite constant if there’s orders made for ongoing contact? but then he’s going to miss out on the opportunity of having a relationship with his father who he could have a great time with, it’s really tricky.
i would say not. she certainly has been very clear with me that she says that mr [ramzi] was abusive towards her. the abuse she alleges is really really significant and can’t be understated. she feels that there is a risk to her son’s safety because of it. if orders were then made for [x] to spend time with his father, i think that would be incredibly hard for her – create huge anxiety for her, and emotionally distressing and she would have to rely a lot on support services which she seems to be well engaged with. but i don’t think there will be anything that will change her mind and make her suddenly supportive of it, if that’s been her experience.
