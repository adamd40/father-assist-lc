reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
the legal principles applicable   a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if: (a) the persons are not legally married to each other, and (b) the persons are not related by family (see subsection (6)), and (c) having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.   a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case.   the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship.
...a statutory range of circumstances which may demonstrate the parties were in a de facto relationship. but, it should be remembered that section 4aa does not require the court to carry out a specific evaluation and/or weighing up of the factors in favour of and against a finding of a de facto relationship.
each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point in one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test.
section 4aa(1)(c) identifies the relationship which is the concern of the act: "a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis". the existence of such a relationship is determined having regard to "all the circumstances" of a relationship, significantly, those "circumstances" include any or all of the circumstances listed in s 4aa(2), and, by reason of s 4aa(3), no particular finding about any circumstance is necessary for there to be a de facto relationship. consistently with the reality that human relationships are infinitely mutable, in determining whether a de facto relationship exists a court is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate [s 4aa(4)].
living together for the purposes of s 4aa(1) will often, perhaps usually, mean cohabitation of some residence by a couple for some period of time. but cohabitation of a residence or residences is not a necessary feature of "living together". that phrase must be construed to take account of the many various ways in which two people may share their lives together in the modern world. two people, for any number of reasons, may not reside in the same residence, but nonetheless be in a de facto relationship in the sense required by s 4aa. ... ...physical cohabitation at a single home or homes is not a necessary feature of an ongoing relationship whether by way of marriage or otherwise, it is not an irreducible minimum that all relationships must exhibit. ... "living together", consistently with authority, should be construed as meaning sharing life as a couple. section 4aa does not prescribe any way by which a couple may share life together. its language is sufficiently broad to accommodate the great variety of ways a de facto relationship may exist. that conclusion is supported by the varied factors listed in s 4aa(2). in a given case, some of the factors listed in s 4aa(2) may be relevant and some may be irrelevant, inevitably some may have greater prominence than others. a conclusion that a de facto relationship has ended may also arise because of factors not listed in s 4aa(2). such a conclusion is mandated by s 4aa(3) and (4). in particular, s 4aa(4) is a statutory recognition that what may constitute a genuine de facto relationship is not be determined in the same way in every case by reference to rigid criteria that must always be satisfied. in that respect, the language of s 4aa(2)(b) does not assume that every de facto relationship must have a "common residence" to some "extent" and of some "nature". such a construction is entirely denied by s 4aa(3). (footnotes and citations omitted)
...the manifestation of a relationship where “the parties have so merged their lives that they were, for all practical purposes, ‘living together’ as a couple on a genuine domestic basis”. it is the manifestation of “coupledom”, which involves the merger of two lives as just described, that is the core of a de facto relationship as defined and to which each of the statutory factors (and others that might apply to a particular relationship) are directed.[14]
the parties' relationship may be seen as having gone through a number of different phases. the facts applicable to each of those phases may be seen as having a different bearing on the essential issue of whether the parties were in a de facto relationship. accordingly, it is appropriate to consider the facts of the parties' relationship in those different phases and then step back and take an overview of the entirety of the facts.[15]
a de facto relationship will have broken down when, having regard to all the circumstances, the parties no longer "have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis". such a conclusion is not precluded by the presence of an ongoing relationship of some sort. that is not the inquiry. the question is whether a de facto relationship exists or has broken down. in the context of a human relationship, "breakdown" refers to the "end" or "breakup" of what had been an enduring emotional bond. it is the "breakdown" or "end" of a de facto relationship that is the trigger point for the federal circuit and family court to be seized of jurisdiction to make a property settlement order under s 90sm of the act. it would make no sense for such a jurisdiction to arise before a de facto relationship had ended.[16]
standard of proof
i had to ask him even to get money to buy a toothbrush, and i was sick of being controlled. it’s like i had the golden handcuffs ... i don’t know a lot of people in relationships that hide their spending from their other partner.[24]
the evidence
background
the early period of the parties’ involvement with one another
about ten years ago (about 2010) [ms kendell] told me that she was going to live with a girlfriend. i never met [ms kendell’s] girlfriend, but recall that [ms kendell] told me her name was [ms w].[26]
in cross-examination, she indicated a belief that ms kendell stopped living with ms w sometime in 2017, when she moved interstate.
events up to 2010
i told the applicant to pull herself together, to stop taking drugs and to stop running around with other men. i said that if she did those things that i would give our relationship a ‘go’.[29]
ms h
i was transferring from my profit of the business or my wages that i didn’t really get to pay for my mother’s mortgage that he and my mother discussed that was right thing to do.[33]
the business
it was around this time that the applicant set up internet banking for the business cheque account. i am not proficient at reading and writing due to having dyslexia and am computer illiterate. the applicant did everything necessary to set up the internet banking including her full access to all of the business accounts. from that time onwards, the applicant took over responsibility for the payment of invoices and outgoings for the business including the payment of sub-contractors.[38]
i’m illiterate, mate. i don’t understand bookwork. i did second year high school and i’ve been at work ever since, so i trusted [ms kendell] do the right thing.[39]
other issues
...why don’t you tell him the truth that you’re a fucked in the head drug addict. that you constantly lie to yourself and so called business partner from [suburb g] and you lie every time you see your mum that you live with your so called imaginary friend [ms w] but with another man...you getting this this is not normal.[46]
no you don't fucking get it. i run around like a fucking dickhead doing my best to keep the peace and make everyone happy. i drive backwards and forwards you think i enjoy doing that? do u think i like having to leave our house and you to go there? but on the things you mentioned briefly as this has already been discussed a few times now. you found drugs in my bag i explained it. when i said i hadnt been to the club i hadn't i went to the club to get what u found in my bag. i don't go and hang at the club ok!!! the missing hours again for the 5th fucking time is im busy tidying the house doing maid duties my phone is usually on silent in the office. but simple solution you pay the fucking rent and i will be in your face all the time as i won't have [suburb g]. we know that cant happen yet. so ease the fuck up on me.[47]
we had an early relationship and that fell apart and i just – i tried to break it off several times...but she threatened suicide. i don’t want to be responsible for something like that, so i’ve kept her on as a worker, kept giving her money, looking after her and i’ve paid the price.[48]

summary of evidence and findings
the duration of the relationship
the nature and extent of common residence
sexual relations
the degree of financial dependence or independence, and any arrangement for financial support between the parties
the ownership, use and acquisition of property
in a civil trial there will very often be a reasonable expectation that a party would give or call relevant evidence. it will, therefore, be open in such a case to conclude that the failure of a party (or someone in that party’s camp) to give evidence leads rationally to an inference that the evidence of that party or witness would not help the party’s case....
....while the principle may make certain evidence or the inferences which may be drawn from the evidence more probable, it does not permit any further inferences that the untendered evidence would have been damaging the party who might have been expected to tender the evidence, nor can the failure to lead the evidence fill gaps in the evidence, or convert conjecture and suspicion into inference.
the degree of commitment to a shared life
registration under a prescribed law
the care and support of children
the reputation and public aspect of the relationship
conclusions
essentially every case is unique and what defines the particular relationship in question requiring of idiosyncratic consideration. in this regard, i bear in mind the strictures laid down by mushin j in moby & schulter and remember that the circumstances of modern life have an infinite capacity to throw up diverse relationships, outside the norms and mores of the social mainstream, which are nonetheless to be accounted de facto relationships, given the definition contained in section 4aa(1).
