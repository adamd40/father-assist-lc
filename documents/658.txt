reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
at this juncture, in my view, two salient factors militate against the making of the orders sought by the wife. firstly, the uncertainty and controversy surrounding the relevant evidence, particularly what is the parties’ worth in net terms. secondly, the fact that a final hearing is relatively imminent being fixed to take place in june of this year, less than six months away.[3]
background
the husband will have to find the additional top up tax from his cashflow. if the husband’s business does not continue to be profitable, the tax will need be paid from alternative sources, the existence of which will be limited given the assets the husband owns or may end up owning following the conclusion of these court proceedings.[5]
this isn't perfect for you, is it?‑‑‑sorry? it’s not perfect for you?‑‑‑it’s not perfect but as long as we’re happy, it’s the perfect home. i don’t – i – i – my views have changed in life lately. my view is a happy home, you happy is a happy – doesn't matter if it needs to be in a glamorous – a luxury home ‑ ‑ ‑ okay?‑‑‑ ‑ ‑ ‑ or a – yes. okay. and to a certain extent [mr pinta] wants it?‑‑‑yes. he does – we both do. yes?‑‑‑yes. and i'm afraid you have to choose.[10]
the evidence
general issues
it is apparent that the parties have borrowed money to fund assets or lifestyle outside of the trading entity over and above profits that have been generated and withdrawn over a number of years. this has been done in circumstances where significant historical trading profits remain to be exposed to personal rates of tax.[12]
the parties’ personal circumstances
separation
on my calculations, this comes to $5,013.87 per month.
parenting arrangements
on 9 august 2020 i informed the wife that i was moving into the [d street, suburb e] property as it has been vacant for approximately 8 months, the tenants having vacated the property in late december 2019/early january 2020. the wife had been telling me she was going to move with the children from the [f street, suburb g] property for over 12 months but had not done so. i had been living with my parents since september 2018 and i needed my own place. i also decided to move because i want to have a place for the children to stay if the court makes such an order. i sent a text message to the wife at 4.48pm on 9 august 2020 informing her that i had moved in and had changed the locks as i did not have any keys to the place and she responded at 5.02pm. within 30 minutes she and the two older children, [x] and [y], turned up at the [d street, suburb e] property.[24]

the legal principles applicable
given the evaluation of contribution based entitlements inevitably moves from qualitative evaluation of contributions to a quantitative reflection of such evaluation, there will inevitably be a “leap” from words to figures. that is the nature of the exercise of discretion, whether it be in the assessment of contributions in the matrimonial cause, assessment of damages in a personal injuries case, or determination of compensation in a land resumption case...
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[40]
as a result of those matters, the court’s approach to s 79/s90sm may be less compartmentalised than what a strict or unthinking adherence to four (or three) “steps” might otherwise reveal. the task is essentially holistic, is it just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the particular relationship or marriage under consideration to make an order and, if so, its terms must similarly meet that criteria. of course, holistic though the approach is, it must be referenced to what the act requires and care must be taken to ensure that the court’s reasons make that clear.[41]
where the court has determined that it is just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79(2) or s 90sm(3) and there is clear evidence that one party has engaged in conduct and, but for that conduct, the legal and equitable interests of a party or the parties (or the value of those interests) would have be significantly greater, justice and equity may require recognition of the unfairness inherent in those circumstances in the terms of the orders to be made. how might that be recognised? first, consistent with existing authority, it can be recognised pursuant to s 75(2)(o) (cf s 90sf(3)(r)) (see, for example, ajo & gro [2005] famcafc 104, (2005) flc 93-218, browne & green [1999] famca 1483, (1999) flc 92-873 and cerini). secondly, it might be contended that it might be recognised within the assessment of contributions. this court has long eschewed the notion of “negative contributions” (see, for example, antmann & antmann [1980] famca 64, (1980) flc 90-908). nevertheless, it might be argued that the “non-dissipating party” can be seen to have made a disproportionally greater indirect contribution to the existing legal and equitable interests (for example to their preservation) if it is established that, but for the other party’s unilateral dissipation, those existing legal and equitable interests would have been greater or had a greater value. the assessment of the circumstance under discussion is, ultimately, a matter of discretion (see, for example, cerini at [46] and townsend at 81,654). equally, however, authority dictates that it will be “the exception rather than the rule” (cerini at [46]) that a direct dollar adjustment equivalent to the amount of the alleged dissipation of the pool is made to the otherwise entitlement of a party. it may be that aspects of the erstwhile treatment of legal fees pre-stanford (see, for example, nhc & rch [2004] famca 633, (2004) flc 93-204) will require further consideration in an appropriate case. importantly, of course, as has been emphasised in many authorities including those cited above, not every dissipation by a party can be seen to involve an affront to justice and equity, again the circumstances of the individual relationship must be assessed.[49]
two fundamental premises emerge from ajo & gro and the authorities preceding it. first, ‘adding back’ is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not ‘exceptional’ justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is ‘a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct’ than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.
this decision appears to confirm the principle that where the payment of legal costs can be regarded as a premature distribution of funds (in which both parties have an interest), it is appropriate to add back those costs as a notional asset. it also confirms the principle that where funds have been borrowed to pay legal fees, and such liability is still outstanding, neither the payment of the fees nor the liability should be taken into account. the decision also supports the proposition that where it is determined that a payment of legal fees should be taken into account as a notional asset, any outstanding liability in respect of those fees should also be taken into account. in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post-separation income or acquisitions.[53]
it is well settled that save in exceptional circumstances a trial judge should deal with the property as at the date of the hearing and make adjustments taking into account the various matters set out under s.79. however, the particular justice of the case may make it appropriate to notionally add back assets which have been demonstrated to have been dissipated either during the marriage or post-separation. normally it is necessary to demonstrate an appropriate basis for doing so, for example by wastage such as gambling or extravagant living. additionally, because of the requirement for each party to bear their own costs, it is generally appropriate to add back to the pool of assets notionally any legal costs that have been spent on the litigation and to deal with the costs as a separate issue at the end of the litigation. there seems to be no appropriate basis for notionally adding back moneys that existed at separation but which have been subsequently spent on meeting reasonably incurred necessary living expenses. neither the family law act nor the case law require that parties go into a state of suspended economic animation once their marriage breaks down pending the resolution of their financial arrangements. parties are entitled to continue to provide for their own support. whether any expenditure so incurred is reasonable or extravagant is a matter that can be determined by the trial judge.[54]
