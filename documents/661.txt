in a nutshell
procedural matters 0] as was pointed out by french cj in aon risk management limited v australian national university courts have an obligation to ensure that the litigation coming before them is transed effectively and efficiently, not only in the interests of the individual parties concerned but also in the interests of other litigants and users of the court, whose cases are inevitably affected by how other cases in the system are managed. his honour said as follows:
...the adversarial system has been qualified by changing practices in the courts directed to the reduction of costs and delay and the realisation that the courts are concerned not only with justice between the parties, which remains their priority, but also with the public interest in the proper and efficient use of public resources.  1] in the case, french cj also noted that courts have the inherent authority to control their processes and prevent their application in a way which would be unfair to a party or would otherwise bring the administration of justice into disrepute among right-thinking people...

constructive trusts  the essential elements of a common intention constructive trust are[13]: (i) that the parties formed a common intention as to the ownership of the beneficial interest. this will usually be formed at the time of the transaction and may be inferred as a matter of fact from the words or conduct of the parties, (i) that the party claiming a beneficial interest must show that he, or she, has acted to his, or her, detriment, and (ii) that it would be a fraud on the claimant for the other party to assert that the claimant had no beneficial interest in the property. (b) once the trust is established, the interest arising under it will be to the extent that the parties are inferred to have intended,[14] and (c) the common intention of the parties is a question of fact, and proof of same which are evidentiary matters, may be direct by means of express agreement or it may be implied from conduct.[15]   that the parties formed a common intention as to the ownership of the beneficial interest. this will usually be formed at the time of the transaction and may be inferred as a matter of fact from the words or conduct of the parties, (i) that the party claiming a beneficial interest must show that he, or she, has acted to his, or her, detriment, and (ii) that it would be a fraud on the claimant for the other party to assert that the claimant had no beneficial interest in the property. (b) once the trust is established, the interest arising under it will be to the extent that the parties are inferred to have intended,[14] and (c) the common intention of the parties is a question of fact, and proof of same which are evidentiary matters, may be direct by means of express agreement or it may be implied from conduct.[15]   that the party claiming a beneficial interest must show that he, or she, has acted to his, or her, detriment, and (ii) that it would be a fraud on the claimant for the other party to assert that the claimant had no beneficial interest in the property. (b) once the trust is established, the interest arising under it will be to the extent that the parties are inferred to have intended,[14] and (c) the common intention of the parties is a question of fact, and proof of same which are evidentiary matters, may be direct by means of express agreement or it may be implied from conduct.[15]  ) that it would be a fraud on the claimant for the other party to assert that the claimant had no beneficial interest in the property. (b) once the trust is established, the interest arising under it will be to the extent that the parties are inferred to have intended,[14] and (c) the common intention of the parties is a question of fact, and proof of same which are evidentiary matters, may be direct by means of express agreement or it may be implied from conduct.[15]   once the trust is established, the interest arising under it will be to the extent that the parties are inferred to have intended,[14] and (c) the common intention of the parties is a question of fact, and proof of same which are evidentiary matters, may be direct by means of express agreement or it may be implied from conduct.[15]   the common intention of the parties is a question of fact, and proof of same which are evidentiary matters, may be direct by means of express agreement or it may be implied from conduct.[15]
... in determining whether there is a common intention that a claimant was to have a beneficial interest in the property the court will look firstly for direct evidence of any express communications between the parties or the making of admissions by them. in addition, the common intention may be inferred from the conduct of the parties, for example, contributions to the cost of the property claimed or its maintenance. such conduct is also of factual importance in determining whether a claimant has acted to his or her detriment. however, what is to be enforced is an actual intention inferred as a matter of fact...
1. the inquiry for the purposes of determining whether there was a common intention is inquiry as to the actual intention of the parties. the law does not impute a presumed intention to the parties based upon what the court considers fair and reasonable persons would have intended, 2. the intention need not be that the parties have a specific share of the property, 3. intention may be established by:
1. agreement as to how the property should be held, 2. express statements of intention, 3. intentions inferred from conduct,
4. a common intention that a party have a beneficial interest in a property owned by another will not be inferred merely from their joint occupation of property, nor the carrying out of household duties, nor the bringing up of children on the property, nor the doing of repairs, renovations, maintenance, decoration or improvement, nor the provision of furniture, 5. the intentions may be inferred from financial contributions, direct or indirect, to the acquisition of property, including the paying of mortgage or the payment of expenses which free up funds for that purpose. in the case of 'the common intention' constructive trust there is no presumption that the beneficial interest is in proportion with the contribution of the purchase price, 6. declarations about intentions before or at the time of the transaction or so close in time after the transaction as to constitute a part of it can be relied on, 7. a plaintiff must show that he or she acted to his or her detriment in a way referable to the agreement or intention that she have an interest in the property, 8. conduct which is insufficient to establish a common intention as to ownership of the property may be sufficient to constitute relevant actions to the plaintiff's detriment to establish a trust if the common intention is established otherwise, 9. conduct may be both the evidence from which an intention that the plaintiff have a beneficial interest can be inferred and the act of detrimental reliance, 10. equality is equity but that statement can be departed from when the parties make disproportionate contributions to the acquisition of the property, 11. the constructive trust may arise after the acquisition of a property where the common intention is formed at a later time. (citations omitted)
... the rationale of the constructive trust must still be found essentially in its remedial function... the constructive trust can properly be described as a remedial institution which equity imposes regardless of actual or presumed agreement or intention (and subsequently protects) to preclude the retention or assertion of beneficial ownership of property to the extent that such retention or assertion would be contrary to equitable principle... such equitable relief by way of constructive trust will only properly be available if applicable principles of the law of equity require that the person in whom the ownership of property is vested should hold it to the use or for the benefit of another.[24]

evidence of representations and conduct
you can trust me and my family... the offset account is our savings account. you will always be entitled to your half of the savings in the offset account and the equity in the property. we don’t have to pay the amount regularly but the more we pay, the less interest is charged and the more we save.
you both will get a chance to save some money and earn equity so you can buy your own place down the track. we will give you and [ms vendric] the difference between our costs and the value. if the property values at a million and our costs are $660,000, you and [ms vendric] get $340,000.
when we buy an investment property, you should live in it. you work in the city so it makes sense and i would prefer to rent the property to a family member then to a stranger. you would pay rent but we could charge you a discounted rate. that means that you could live somewhere nicer than where you are living in [suburb g].

where the conduct is the speaking of words in the course of a conversation, it is necessary that the words spoken be proved with a degree of precision sufficient to enable the court to be reasonably satisfied that they were in fact misleading in the proved circumstances ... furthermore, human memory of what was said in a conversation is fallible for a variety of reasons, and ordinarily the degree of fallibility increases with the passage of time, particularly where disputes or litigation intervene, and the processes of memory are overlaid, often subconsciously, by perceptions or self-interest as well as conscious consideration of what should have been said or could have been said. all too often what is actually remembered is little more than an impression from which plausible details are then, again often subconsciously, constructed. all this is a matter of ordinary human experience.
conclusion as to the pool and determination of whether there was a constructive trust
the four representations
the circumstantial evidence and conduct
agency  firstly, there is no evidence of actual authority. (b) secondly, the jurisprudence[36] is clear that three things need to be established for apparent authority:[37] (i) a representation was made by an agent, that they had authority to act on the principal’s behalf in entering into the arrangement with a third party, (ii) the person granting authority to the agent, did so with ‘actual’ authority, and (iii) the third party was induced by this representation, and in fact relied upon it.   secondly, the jurisprudence[36] is clear that three things need to be established for apparent authority:[37] (i) a representation was made by an agent, that they had authority to act on the principal’s behalf in entering into the arrangement with a third party, (ii) the person granting authority to the agent, did so with ‘actual’ authority, and (iii) the third party was induced by this representation, and in fact relied upon it.   a representation was made by an agent, that they had authority to act on the principal’s behalf in entering into the arrangement with a third party, (ii) the person granting authority to the agent, did so with ‘actual’ authority, and (iii) the third party was induced by this representation, and in fact relied upon it.  ) the person granting authority to the agent, did so with ‘actual’ authority, and (iii) the third party was induced by this representation, and in fact relied upon it.  i) the third party was induced by this representation, and in fact relied upon it.
is the e street, suburb f property held on trust for the spouses?  the spouses re-painted the property at their expense and the parents paid tradesmen to renovate the bathroom and replace floor coverings and blinds, and (b) the spouses commenced to reside there on august 2011, and (c) the spouses commenced to pay about $500 to $600 per week into the offset account, of which the applicant paid $250 to $300.   the spouses commenced to reside there on august 2011, and (c) the spouses commenced to pay about $500 to $600 per week into the offset account, of which the applicant paid $250 to $300.   the spouses commenced to pay about $500 to $600 per week into the offset account, of which the applicant paid $250 to $300.   did not seek to purchase a unit with the wife which they could have been able to afford, and thereby did not receive an opportunity to own property which would improve in value, (b) sold the h street, city j property and applied the proceeds of $40,865.87 to the discharge of debt ($9,000), the payment of living expenses, and the purchase of a motorcycle, in consequence of which he lost the benefit of capital improvement of that property, and (c) together with the first respondent paid the water and council rates, insurance, capital expenditure and body corporate fees.   sold the h street, city j property and applied the proceeds of $40,865.87 to the discharge of debt ($9,000), the payment of living expenses, and the purchase of a motorcycle, in consequence of which he lost the benefit of capital improvement of that property, and (c) together with the first respondent paid the water and council rates, insurance, capital expenditure and body corporate fees.   together with the first respondent paid the water and council rates, insurance, capital expenditure and body corporate fees.
the ultimate basis for the imposition of a constructive trust is that it would be unconscionable for the holder of the legal title to the property to assert that he holds it free of any beneficial interest in the claimant. however, although “unconscionability” is the underlying basis upon which equity will intervene, it is not itself a sufficient description of the principles upon which equity does so. equitable rights do not arise merely because the court considers it fair in all the proven circumstances that the legal owner of property should hold it, or a portion of it, for the benefit of another.
