continuing to hear the matter  paragraph 97 – i am very concerned about the child being involved in the court proceedings by reading court documents. this should never have happened. it is important to consider paragraph 182 of the family report which i set out in full as follows:
assessment data attests [x] and [y] have been exposed to court documents, such exposure ranges from reading the documents out of curiosity, [ms berry] reading the documents to them, one or both assisting [ms berry] with the details of alleged incidents when she is drafting her affidavits in addition to discussions about court documents and the paternal family. from the writer’s perspective, such exposure can have life-long adverse effects on adolescents. such exposure may result in a young person initially aligning themself with one parent, typically the parent they perceive to be the victim. however, as the young person matures and is less influenced by others, they reflect on past parental dynamics resulting in the once aligned parent being rejected. from a psychological perspective the exposure of young persons to court documents can have detrimental impact on the young person’s mental health, placing them at greater risk of using and abusing illicit substances and alcohol, a lack of trust in relationships and at risk of suicide-related behaviour. during this assessment, [ms berry] identified [x] blames herself for the current situation and is experiencing distress. from the writer’s perspective, [ms berry] appears to lack insight as to how [x]’s and [y]’s exposure to court documents have impacted on their emotional health. the writer would argue, a young person’s exposure to court documents is a form of psychological abuse perpetrated by the adult that is allowing and/or facilitating such exposure.   paragraph 199 – it seems to me that the mother was telling the truth or the truth as she sees it, in most of her answers. however this raises a separate consideration. does the mother have insight into how her behaviour affects her children and in particular x? i think not, where one considers the domestic violence the child has been exposed to, the poor distance education and as ms murphy submitted, the complete abrogation of the mother's responsibility as a parent, in letting the child choose whether she sees the father or not. (c) paragraph 200 - on this last point, i think that there is more to the issue then appears superficially. it is not simply that “the child can do as she wishes”. the child should never be put in this position of making decisions about seeing her parents. the child should never be encouraged to take on that role which is for parents rather than children, to decide. in my view, the child remains so affected by the mother abandoning her in early 2020 which in reality is what happened, that she will not be willing now to give any indication the to the mother of an interest in seeing the father and his family.   paragraph 200 - on this last point, i think that there is more to the issue then appears superficially. it is not simply that “the child can do as she wishes”. the child should never be put in this position of making decisions about seeing her parents. the child should never be encouraged to take on that role which is for parents rather than children, to decide. in my view, the child remains so affected by the mother abandoning her in early 2020 which in reality is what happened, that she will not be willing now to give any indication the to the mother of an interest in seeing the father and his family.
9. as i have said, my view based on the material filed by the father or on behalf of the father, is that the mother is in a clear breach of a recently made order. that order is very clear in its terms. it was made after a five-day trial in which significant findings with respect to the mother’s parenting were made. 10. it is my view that it is in the child’s best interests that the terms of that order be enforced to the extent possible and similarly therefore, that the mother’s breach not be tolerated and i will use that word, any longer than should be possible. in my view therefore, it is appropriate for the court to make an ex parte order on an urgent basis.

the mother’s financial circumstances  the mother has incurred costs and disbursements of a significant amount with her previous solicitors in the vicinity of that “suffered by the father”.

i understand that the costs order in the mother’s unsuccessful parenting appeal was $14,561.07. this seems to mean that the mother has spent $60,438.93 ($75,000 less $14,561.07) in costs this year.   the mother’s estimated costs with respect to the father’s costs application are $7,500 plus gst, thus $8,250, according to the costs notice provided to her on 31 october.

the mother and mr f owe $1,400,086 for the purchase of the h street, suburb j property.   the mother’s town g property near city b was part of the security for the above-mentioned loan. (e) the mother owes mr f about $152,000 for his payment of legal fees for her.   the mother owes mr f about $152,000 for his payment of legal fees for her.   she is not personally the owner of the town g property outside city b. it is owned by the berry family trust. the title search annexed to the mother’s affidavit indicates that this transaction may have occurred in june 2019. (b) she is indebted to her father personally or in relation to the family trust, in the approximate sum of $474,400. the documents said to explain this being annexure 4 to the mother's affidavit, are not clear.   she is indebted to her father personally or in relation to the family trust, in the approximate sum of $474,400. the documents said to explain this being annexure 4 to the mother's affidavit, are not clear.
a letter from the law firm acting for the mother in may 2019 appears to refer to the purchase of the town g property. $445,606 is required to complete the purchase. there is a copy of a bank statement which might be a statement for the account of the mother's father, showing a transfer with the note/description “ms berry loan” in the sum of $445,606 on 11 june, apparently 2019.   the amount owing by the mother to her father seems to be for the purchase of the town g property and for legal fees. i say this because in her financial statement, the mother says she owes her father $377,300 for the loan to buy the town g property. if $474,400 is now owing to the mother’s father, this suggests the mother’s father has loaned her not less than $97,100 for legal fees. (d) annexure 6 to the mother's affidavit are bank records and a statement prepared i assume by the mother or mr f, showing money owed by the mother to him. the mother says at paragraph 21 of her affidavit that with respect to one of the loans namely $44,000 in january this year (although there is a reference to caravan rather than legal fees) she has repaid mr f $30,000. the mother says that all up, she presently owes mr f about $155,000.   annexure 6 to the mother's affidavit are bank records and a statement prepared i assume by the mother or mr f, showing money owed by the mother to him. the mother says at paragraph 21 of her affidavit that with respect to one of the loans namely $44,000 in january this year (although there is a reference to caravan rather than legal fees) she has repaid mr f $30,000. the mother says that all up, she presently owes mr f about $155,000.   in her financial statement under the heading in part i “property owned by you”, the town g property is listed.

mother’s view of present proceedings
in that emailed letter the father made various allegations which i deny and which did nothing to assist [x] going back into the father’s care. in that regard, i say: that to a large degree, by his conduct, the father’s real agenda now is to obtain a costs order against me having given up on his pursuit of sole parental care of [x], in other words, he no longer believes it is in [x]’s best interests to reside with him, again in other words, the whole of the litigation process appears to have been a waste of time and morphed into a new agenda by the father to obtain a costs order against me (as against identifying the best interests of [x], preserving the final orders of this court and an attempt of painting me in the poorest of light before this court).
cases
it is an accurate description of section 117(1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the subsection is not paramount to section 117(2). as subsection (1) is expressed to be subject to subsection (2), the former must yield whenever a judge finds a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. subsection (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an application for order for costs. consequently with respect to their honours in the family court, we do not agree with the suggestion made in the judgment under appeal that an order can only be made under section 117(2) in “a clear case”.   at the time the father commenced the parenting proceedings which resulted in the final order made in january this year, there was already a final parenting order. it was made in 2014. the mother was in breach of that order when the most recent parenting proceedings were commenced. i refer to paragraph 27 of the january 2022 judgment. (b) before the trial last year, the mother was in breach of interim orders in those proceedings. the interim orders required the child to spend time with the father. in most cases, that did not occur. i refer to paragraph 30 of the january 2022 judgment. (c) the mother’s breaches continued over an extended period including during the 2020/21 court proceedings. the mother knew what she was doing was in breach of the orders including interim orders. (d) i found that the mother took no steps or effort to try to maintain or build on the child's relationship with the father. in fact, the opposite was the case and the mother while saying that the child could make up her own mind, never took any action to encourage the child in her relationship with the father. (e) the mother was in breach of interim orders made in the recent and current (2022) proceedings to the extent that she did not facilitate the child remaining with the father and/or did not take steps immediately to return the child to the father on occasions this year. (f) i found that the mother's breach of orders were made in a positive sense, namely that she knew she was breaching the orders. i found that the mother was acting with an intention that the child spend no time with nor have a relationship with, the father.   before the trial last year, the mother was in breach of interim orders in those proceedings. the interim orders required the child to spend time with the father. in most cases, that did not occur. i refer to paragraph 30 of the january 2022 judgment. (c) the mother’s breaches continued over an extended period including during the 2020/21 court proceedings. the mother knew what she was doing was in breach of the orders including interim orders.

in deciding whether the circumstances justify an order for costs, there is a broad discretion to be exercised, having regard to the factors set out in subsection (2a) so far as relevant. those factors (the subsection (2a) factors) are not to be read in any restrictive way, however, the discretion remaining is a broad one. the full court referred to the high court’s decision in penfold.   the mother included a relocation application prior to trial. this would have involved the child being relocated to city c from the city b area where the child lived all of her life. as the mother planned to live on a grazing property or similar outside city c, the mother proposed that the child attend boarding school. the mother was wholly unsuccessful in that application. (b) as referred to above, the proceedings which culminated in the trial late last year arose out of the mother's contravention of previous orders, namely that she did not as ordered, facilitate the child having a relationship with and spending time with the father. i accept what the father says in paragraph 18(d) of his affidavit filed 11 february this year with his costs application, namely:   as referred to above, the proceedings which culminated in the trial late last year arose out of the mother's contravention of previous orders, namely that she did not as ordered, facilitate the child having a relationship with and spending time with the father. i accept what the father says in paragraph 18(d) of his affidavit filed 11 february this year with his costs application, namely:
the initial position i adopted in the conduct of this case was "merely" a restoration of the prior orders of the court, i did not want to challenge the primary role that [ms berry] played in the life of [x]. it was only as time elapsed, and it became apparent that [ms berry] was not doing anything to support the relationship between [x] and me, that i changed my position to be one where she should reside with me.   i found that the mother's attitude was such and this was demonstrated by her behaviour, that it would be difficult if not impossible to build a relationship between the child and the father without a change to the child's residence. the mother had taken the child away for an indefinite time, to the northern territory. this was a feature of considerable cross-examination during the trial including that the travel involved breaches of regular time being spent between the father and the child, questions about the child’s living arrangements and importantly, the mother's failure to maintain the child’s education by remote learning. (d) i found that the father was a reliable witness – see paragraph 129 of the judgment. (e) i found that the father's partner ms l was a reliable witness – see paragraph 143 of the judgment. (f) i found the father’s parents to be reliable witnesses - see paragraph 158 of the judgment. (g) dr m gave evidence to rebut the mother's claims about the father's alleged excessive drinking. i accepted his evidence that the father's cdt test result would not be consistent with a result from a person who drinks to excess. (h) i expressed concern that the mother did not or could not explain how the child could completely turn around in her view about spending time with the father, to not wanting to see him at all. this included criticising the mother for allowing the child to read court material – see paragraph 196 of the judgment. (i) i had a concern about the mother's failure to provide satisfactory education for the child when she took the child on the lengthy trip to the northern territory – see paragraph 198 of the judgment. (j) i commented that while a lot of the mother's evidence was correct or truthful from her point of view, the mother's seemed to have no insight into how her behaviour (including domestic violence between the mother and one or more partners) affected the child – see paragraphs 199 and 203 of the judgment. (k) i was critical of the mother on a number of occasions through the judgment, for letting the child read the court documents and going so far as to letting the child have some input into court documents either directly or indirectly. (l) i found that the mother did not have any basis for a concern that he child spending time with the father was a risk to the child – see paragraphs 44 - 46 of the judgment. (m) overall, it was my view as was demonstrated clearly through the evidence, that the mother had no interest in the child continuing a relationship with the father or spending time with him. she took active measures contrary to court orders, for this not to occur. mr fellows in his written submissions in item 11 refers to the mother poisoning the child's attitude to the father. i think that this is a correct description of what i heard about with numerous examples, during the trial last year.   i found that the father was a reliable witness – see paragraph 129 of the judgment. (e) i found that the father's partner ms l was a reliable witness – see paragraph 143 of the judgment. (f) i found the father’s parents to be reliable witnesses - see paragraph 158 of the judgment.

to this figure should be added the cost of the father’s costs applications. the father does apply for these costs.
i have now spent my parents entire life savings on these proceedings. they have no money left and neither do i, which is why i have been unable to file further recovery proceedings in this court and an application for contravention.
and at paragraph 18:
while i am not financially able to file another recovery application, i continue to check in with the school to make sure [x] is attending school and is well. i also continue to reach out to [x] directly.
quantum of orders  it is quite unusual for an indemnity costs order to be made. cases including colgate-palmolive company & colgate palmolive pty limited v cussons pty limited [1993] fca 801 in the high court set out the relevant principles. (b) i do not doubt that the father has paid or has been billed, at least $150,000 in legal costs since commencing the current proceedings, most of which he (or his parents on his behalf) has paid. this level of costs would not be considered excessive for the litigation in the principal proceedings and then this year. (c) there is a good argument for the mother to pay substantial legal costs. i made findings against her in the primary judgment delivered on 17 january this year, that not only had the mother breached final and then interim orders during the proceedings which provided that the child spend time with the father, but she was consciously and actively doing this. i did not accept the mother's evidence that the child did not wish to spend time with the father. the mother made no effort to facilitate time between the child and the father. the mother's behaviour continued this year. the child came into her care or was otherwise not with the father, on occasions when the primary order dated 17 january was breached. the mother made no or no proper efforts to return the child to the father or to encourage her to return.   i do not doubt that the father has paid or has been billed, at least $150,000 in legal costs since commencing the current proceedings, most of which he (or his parents on his behalf) has paid. this level of costs would not be considered excessive for the litigation in the principal proceedings and then this year.
