reasons for judgment
judge street:
1. i am the owner of the property at [b(2) street, suburb c]. i purchased that property in 1999. annexed hereto and marked "-1" is a copy of a title search for that property. 2. in 2001 i became aware of my neighbour at [b street, suburb c] listing his home for sale for $255,000. annexed hereto and marked "-2" is a copy of a title search for that property. 3. i was interested in acquiring the property. ultimately i bought the property for the full purchase price. i used the monies i had inherited from myÂ· late parents to pay for that property. annexed hereto and marked "-3" is a copy of the overseas transfer of 87,000 pounds sterling used by me to purchase the property. 4. i am the mother of [mr gaber]. i have five other adult children. [mr gaber] is my oldest son. 5. at the time i bought the property at [b street, suburb c], [mr gaber] had a permanent resident visa to live in australia but had not yet acquired his australian citizenship. both he and his wife [ms jabara] travelled between [country d] and australia for the purpose of their children being born in australia. 6. my husband, [mr k] passed away in australia in 2000. 7. when i purchased the property at [b street, suburb c] i did not have any knowledge of trusts. i wanted to put the property in [mr gaber]'s name in the hope that it would assist him in being able to gain his australian citizenship. i asked mr gaber to ensure that he made a will that provided for the property at [b street, suburb c] to pass to [mr gaber]'s estate and to [mr gaber]'s five siblings in equal shares in case something happened to me. [mr gaber] provided me with a copy of the will he made with [l law firm] solicitors dated [2001]. a copy of that will is annexed and marked "-4".
i give the real estate property known as [b street, suburb c], nsw to the following persons as tenants in common in equal one-sixth shares: my sister, [ms m], my sister [ms n], my sister [ms o], my sister [ms p], my brother [mr q], my wife [ms jabara]. this property is given to the aforementioned in recognition of fact that all moneys for the purchase of the said property were supplied by my mother and which moneys were to be given to all my sisters and brothers as part of their inheritance.
13. i am the registered proprietor of the property at [b street, suburb c]. i did not contribute any money to the purchase of that property. the purchase price and stamp duty was paid by my mother, [ms castella]. my mother has sworn an affidavit setting out the circumstances of her paying for that property and i rely upon her evidence. i consider that i hold that property for my mother who has stated that she intends the property to ultimately pass in equal shares to her 6 children - one of whom is me. as requested by my mother i made a will dated [2001] in which i leave the property in equal shares to my 5 siblings and to [ms jabara] in equal shares.
the law with respect to resulting trusts is not in doubt. where property is transferred by one person into the name of another without consideration, and where a purchaser pays the vendor and directs him to transfer the property into the name of another person without consideration passing from that person, there is a presumption that the transferee holds the property upon trust for the transferor or the purchaser as the case may be. this proposition is subject to the exception that in the case of transfers to a wife or a child (including someone with respect to whom the transferor or purchaser stands in loco parentis) there is a presumption of advancement so that the beneficial as well as the legal interest will pass. each of the presumptions may be rebutted with evidence.
the relevant presumptions are, however, too well entrenched as "land-marks" in the law of property (per eyre l.c.b., dyer v. dyer (1788) 2 cox 92, at p 93 [1788] ewhc j8, (30 er 42, at p 43) to be simply discarded by judicial decision. indeed, the law embodying them has been said in this court to be so clear that it "can ... no longer be the subject of argument" (per dixon c.j., mctiernan, williams, fullagar and taylor jj., charles marshall pty. ltd. v. grimsley, at p 364). if they are to be modified to avoid prima facie assumptions that a person intends the opposite to that which he does, it must be by legislative intervention which will not disturb past transactions which may conceivably have been structured by reference to them. the present case was resolved in the courts below by reference to one or other of those presumptions as a starting point. it must be so resolved in this court. there are three presumptions of equity which are here relevant. the first is that which was applied by rath j. at first instance in this case but was held by the court of appeal to be irrelevant upon a proper appreciation of the facts. worded in terms that are appropriate for present purposes, it is: where a person pays the purchase price of property and causes it to be transferred to another or to another and himself jointly, the property is presumed to be held by the transferee or transferees upon trust for the person who provided the purchase money. the second can properly be seen as complementary of the first. it is: where two or more persons advance the purchase price of property in different shares, it is presumed that the person or persons to whom the legal title is transferred holds or hold the property upon resulting trust in favour of those who provided the purchase price in the shares in which they provided it. (emphasis added).
the equitable presumption can be rebutted or qualified in a given case by evidence of a contrary intention common to the contributors of the purchase price (calverley v green, per mason and brennan jj at 261).
