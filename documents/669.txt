chronology
analysis – litigation guardian  firstly, because the mother disputes dr b’s opinion and the basis for the opinion is untested, (b) secondly, because dr b’s report is over 12 months old and does not directly address the issue of the mother’s capacity to conduct these proceedings but rather the report goes to issues raised in the substantive parenting proceedings, (c) thirdly, dr c says that whilst the mother’s emails (which must pre-date the bundle included in exhibit icl3) demonstrate dysregulated thoughts, dr c also says that the mother’s presentation can be variable and the mother can present and function normally, and (d) finally there is no medical evidence that specifically addresses the finding i am being invited to make pursuant to r 3.12(1)(b).   secondly, because dr b’s report is over 12 months old and does not directly address the issue of the mother’s capacity to conduct these proceedings but rather the report goes to issues raised in the substantive parenting proceedings, (c) thirdly, dr c says that whilst the mother’s emails (which must pre-date the bundle included in exhibit icl3) demonstrate dysregulated thoughts, dr c also says that the mother’s presentation can be variable and the mother can present and function normally, and (d) finally there is no medical evidence that specifically addresses the finding i am being invited to make pursuant to r 3.12(1)(b).   thirdly, dr c says that whilst the mother’s emails (which must pre-date the bundle included in exhibit icl3) demonstrate dysregulated thoughts, dr c also says that the mother’s presentation can be variable and the mother can present and function normally, and (d) finally there is no medical evidence that specifically addresses the finding i am being invited to make pursuant to r 3.12(1)(b).   finally there is no medical evidence that specifically addresses the finding i am being invited to make pursuant to r 3.12(1)(b).   i have no direct evidence from her lawyers that they are having issues with gaining the mother’s instructions to conduct the proceedings (when it is open to them to do so, particularly given they have been served with the icl’s application and were aware of the hearing). instead, i have the unusual situation of two lawyers being on the record for the mother and no trial material filed by either party (making it somewhat difficult for me to accept a submission that the failure by the mother is caused by her incapacity to instruct when i am not asked to look unfavourably upon the father for his similar failing), (b) i have the mother’s expressions of frustration about how the scheme operates and her intention to privately instruct a solicitor, who it must be noted, could have been so instructed before today’s hearing and thus assisted the mother’s defence of the icl’s application, and (c) the mother conducted herself appropriately today - yes she did become teary and tangential at times, but she managed her divergence and understandable emotions quickly and was able to re-gather her thoughts and move on. in addition, i apprehend from her submissions that she has reflected on her practice of sending ‘stream of consciousness’ emails and hopefully will now cease and desist - if for no other reasons so that she does not give the other parties any more documents which they may seek to weaponise against her at the trial and to allow her solicitor to not be distracted by her emails and to instead focus on trial preparation.   i have the mother’s expressions of frustration about how the scheme operates and her intention to privately instruct a solicitor, who it must be noted, could have been so instructed before today’s hearing and thus assisted the mother’s defence of the icl’s application, and (c) the mother conducted herself appropriately today -
