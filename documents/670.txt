some witness observations:
chronology of events:
prior to x’s birth
i’m so fucking tired and over having to give [mr caldwell] all these chances because this is why he’s still doing this shit. saturday night should have woke him up but still doesn’t listen! i’m tired because 90% of the time i’m angry or upset and crying not enjoying anything that’s happening in my life, when it should be the other way around. i’m feeling so hurt and lost in life i need to make big changes otherwise i’m going to go down a dark path which i don’t know where that will lead me.
the paternal grandmother, well aware of the father’s drug issues, responded sympathetically.[4] she bought the father some products to help him quit.
x’s earliest days
mother facilitates father (and paternal family) spending time with x
final separation, liberal time arrangements implemented & father moves to sydney for work
2020
mother unsuccessfully tries to relocate
i am writing this letter to let you know that in order to maintain and develop my relationship with [mr m], i will be relocating with our daughter [x] from [town l] nsw to [town b] nsw from about 12 april 2021 to april 2022. our plan is to relocate back closer to this area in 2022 and buy a home. as you are aware, [mr m] and i have been doing long distance relationship since september 2019. [town b] is where [mr m] lives and works a 7/7 roster plus overtime. [mr m] and i also plan to try have a baby this year and as i am living with my father that wouldn’t be practical. it is important to me that [x] continues to maintain her relationship with you as her father while we are at [town b].
i’ve had some time to think over the letter you sent me about relocating and i don’t give consent for you to move [x] away as it’s not fair on her or myself and the loving relationship we have been building together i hope you understand where i’m coming from being her father. [8]
if you would please reread my letter dated 18 march 2021 and send me your proposal if you would like to add/or change anything we can both communicate on a regular basis to come to an agreement before we relocate on 12 april 2021.[9]

the reality is that maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents. obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have been incurred.

conclusion as to x’s best interests:
the legislation requires that there be a primary consideration given to the benefit of the child having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents but does not purport to describe how that meaningful relationship is best promoted in the circumstances of any one case. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[14]
