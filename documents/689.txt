"where, as here, a question arises as to the independence or impartiality of the judge, the applicable principles are well established, and they were not in dispute. the apprehension of bias principle is that "a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.” the principal gives effect to the requirement that justice should both be done and be seen to be done, reflecting a requirement fundamental to the common law system of adversarial trial – that it is conducted by an independent and impartial tribunal. its application requires two steps: first, "it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge... to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits", and, second, there must be articulated a "logical connection" between that matter and the feared departure from the judge deciding the case on its merits. once those two steps are taken, the reasonableness of the asserted apprehension of bias can then ultimately be assessed."

“paragraph 24: the court does not consider the father was avoidant in his answers... and his inability... does not undermine his credibility generally."
“[23] the applicant father gave his evidence in a manner that was straightforward and, in the court’s view, candid. there was no improper hesitancy in the oral evidence given by the applicant other than in relation to the topic as to the purchase of antihistamines and the “puffer.” [24] in relation to these topics, the father was questioned about very specific matters relating to the purchase of the antihistamines and the puffer (of a year ago) such as place of purchase. despite some hesitancy in answering, the court does not consider the father was avoidant in his answers to these specific questions and in his inability to identify a place of purchase of such items does not undermine his credibility generally. [25] the father admitted matter of factly that he smacked the children but not in anger. the court accepts his evidence in that regard. [26] the court rejects submissions made on behalf of the mother that adverse findings should be made about the father’s credit as a witness or his oral evidence either generally or in specific reference to particular aspects of his care of the children.”   the contravention proceedings were proceedings where: (i) the wife by her own admission contravened orders, (ii) the proceedings in which judgment was given were ones where the issue was whether there was a reasonable excuse made out by the mother, (iii) no preference was expressed for the father's evidence over that of the mother, (iv) there was no finding of credit about the mother as a witness, (v) the determination of the question whether there existed a “reasonable excuse" turned upon the construction and classification circumstances alleged by the mother as a matter of law rather than as a contest of factual findings, and (b) at the parenting trial there will be further or other evidence, (c) the “logical connection" has not been demonstrated that any “further evaluation" at trial will not consider or deal with further and other evidence going beyond that which falls to be considered for the purposes of a contravention application. (d) such further evidence would not have a bearing upon the determination with respect to the prior determination of a “reasonable excuse” or vice versa as such evidence would have already been brought forward and considered in the context of the application – contravention, and, (e) any judge hearing the trial of parenting matters and (subject to a prior determination under s 69zt(3)) would be entitled to be presented with evidence of the order made and the judgment in the application – contravention to be any considered in the context of all other evidence to be presented at the parenting trial, and (f) that the nature of a contravention application does not automatically preclude a judge from determining parenting proceedings   the wife by her own admission contravened orders, (ii) the proceedings in which judgment was given were ones where the issue was whether there was a reasonable excuse made out by the mother, (iii) no preference was expressed for the father's evidence over that of the mother, (iv) there was no finding of credit about the mother as a witness, (v) the determination of the question whether there existed a “reasonable excuse" turned upon the construction and classification circumstances alleged by the mother as a matter of law rather than as a contest of factual findings, and  ) the proceedings in which judgment was given were ones where the issue was whether there was a reasonable excuse made out by the mother, (iii) no preference was expressed for the father's evidence over that of the mother, (iv) there was no finding of credit about the mother as a witness, (v) the determination of the question whether there existed a “reasonable excuse" turned upon the construction and classification circumstances alleged by the mother as a matter of law rather than as a contest of factual findings, and  i) no preference was expressed for the father's evidence over that of the mother, (iv) there was no finding of credit about the mother as a witness, (v) the determination of the question whether there existed a “reasonable excuse" turned upon the construction and classification circumstances alleged by the mother as a matter of law rather than as a contest of factual findings, and  ) there was no finding of credit about the mother as a witness, (v) the determination of the question whether there existed a “reasonable excuse" turned upon the construction and classification circumstances alleged by the mother as a matter of law rather than as a contest of factual findings, and   the determination of the question whether there existed a “reasonable excuse" turned upon the construction and classification circumstances alleged by the mother as a matter of law rather than as a contest of factual findings, and   at the parenting trial there will be further or other evidence, (c) the “logical connection" has not been demonstrated that any “further evaluation" at trial will not consider or deal with further and other evidence going beyond that which falls to be considered for the purposes of a contravention application.

"[4] it is well-established that judges have an obligation to sit on matters that are assigned to them, except where there is some good reason, such as at actual bias or the reasonable apprehension of bias, for them not to sit. it is not for litigants to pick and choose judges according to their perception as to the way that their choice might advantage them or disadvantage their opponents (rajski v wood (1989) 18 nswlr 512 at [519]-[520], re: j.r.l., ex parte c.j.l [1986] hca 39, (1986) 161 clr 342 per mason j at 352). [5] in ebner, gleeson cj, mchugh, gummow and hayne jj said: 19. judges have a duty to exercise their judicial functions when their jurisdiction is regularly invoked and they are assigned to cases in accordance with the practice which prevails in the court to which they belong. they do not select the cases they will hear, and they are not at liberty to decline to hear cases without good cause. judges do not choose their cases, and litigants do not choose their judges. if one party to a case objects to a particular judge sitting, or continuing to sit, then that objection should not prevail unless it is based upon a substantial ground for contending that the judge is disqualified from hearing and deciding the case."
