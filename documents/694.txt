father: [referring to [x]] but i tell you what, for the rest of his life i’ll ruin him when he is with me. .... i’ll teach him every swear word, so every good you do i will undo it on the weekend, just to get back at you. so i would use him. .... i will carry that on until he’s older. have him, have him. that’s fine. that’s fine. don’t expect anything good from me for the next 20 years. so you can hit 60 and i’ll still be giving you grief, through him. i’ll have to talk to you but you will always be a cunt for 20 years. you know that word, [x], don’t you? .... no, cunt. [x]: cunt. father: that’s your mother. [x]: yeah. mother: you don’t say bad words. father: your mother, so who’s the shit? [x]: [ay]. father: [ay] is the shit. who’s the cunt? there. [x]: mummy. father: that’s right. 20 years. for 20 years that’s what you are. then you can do what you want sweetie because i’ll be fucking gone by then. blasting 20 years in your face. and you know i don’t give up. you know i’ll never give up. ... you know that. you know that. you know that. so, whatever you want to create with him i’ll fucking ruin. and i ain’t going far. and if it means stabbing myself and sending you down, i’ll fucking send you down. because you’re a selfish cunt.
father: fuck you cunt. move out and i will kill you. mother: we’re moving out next week [mr mancari]. father: well i will kill you, i’ll kill both of you. ... and one night when you’re coming home from work i’ll kill you. so you can draw the line now, fine, move out, but you will be dead. so what. and i will go to jail. there is no death penalty in australia. so what is the worst that can happen to me. is it worse for me to carry on living or be in prison. i thought about this every night for the last three nights. mother: you are crazy. father: i think i would prefer to be in prison, but you are dead and he, i don’t know where he is. it will reach the next stage very closely, very quickly. move out, fine, but i’ll find you and kill you. i’m telling you this in front of him. if he is orphaned, if he has to go back to be with his grandparents, that is fine, but he will survive, but he will know that i killed you. and i will kill you and he will know i killed his mother. because i think it is better in prison in four walls knowing, than living and struggling, watching tv all day, then knowing that you are with him and you ruined my life. so i will pick up a knife and stab you so fucking hard it will just take one hit. the police can’t do anything. it’s your choice. you ruin my life.
keep pushing me. keep pushing me. you think that by not living with me i won’t be pushed anymore? it’ll just get worse. i’d rather have a day out with him today. what happened, nothing. i don’t want to do anything anymore with him. you understand that? it means nothing to me. you understand that? what it means to me is getting to you through him now. so everything bad he will learn from me. and when he is older he’ll understand it was you, the source of all of it. the source of all of it. you think i’m going to sit there in a house somewhere, in a room, in a fucking bedsit somewhere on my own and be happy? do you think i’m going to be happy? i’m going to be brewing, brewing and brewing. i don’t know what’s gonna happen as a result of all that. you think you’re gonna be safe somewhere? you think you’re gonna be in a one bed somewhere or two bed somewhere with him, somewhere cheap? you two on your own, that’s the solution? i won’t be far. i won’t be far. so everything good that you do with him, i will completely ruin. every weekend. you understand? it’s no different from being here, is it? no. no. last being a part he will lose it and he will lose his head and mind and he will have to grow up with that in his brain, that desperation unhappiness, no matter what good you do, he’s fucked. you’ve ruined his life. and he’ll grow up disruptive. he’ll grow up disfigured. he’ll grow up psychologically disturbed. you’ve left me no choice but to turn on him now. to get to you. so you know how it feels. you understand that? okay, good. because i’m not going to be the only one who has to suffer. you will too. you think i’m going to suffer on my own. you will too. you will. i promise you, you will. i’ll do everything to turn the next 10, 15 years into a fucking living nightmare for you. everything.
7 july 2015 – you did nothing, did nothing to try and make a family for [x], did nothing. that makes you a terrible mother, one that is obsessed by my little boy and has done everything to destroy his life and future. so do not ever say that i need to protect him and i am the only and best thing in his life. you offer nothing to him and carry on taking from him. everything will deteriorate and get worse, i won’t have to do anything, he will see the hate in my eyes towards you. he will run to me and want to be with me, there is no competition when it comes to father and son. i will look forward to watching you fall apart. there is more than enough to keep me going. revenge will be more than sweet and worth the wait. 18 january 2016 – i will protect him for now, i will wait until he is older. that boy will hit you with all his force when older and when he is twice your size. he will never want to see you again.
29 february 2016 – you just carry on making my blood boil – it will just make things much worse for [x]. he will soon see my anger and understand it. he will learn to live with it and when the time comes we will channel it against you and we are gone for good. if you meet someone else then even better for us. [x] will never go against me, never. i can see it in his eyes when he’s with me. it’s just a matter of time. every email i send is copied on, every day without him and with him is documented in detail. congratulations on kidnapping him, it will buy you another few years with him. so carry on sleeping with him/breastfeeding him (or brain-washing him to your advantage) but it will be all in vain because you will never see him again soon. i live and breathe now for revenge, nothing else. soon [x] will believe in the same.
29 february 2016 – soon he will reach an age when i will explain everything to him with a lot of emotion, passion and anger and he will understand. it will hit him the same. when he is old enough, every minute and every hour he & i spent together will not be beaches and sports. every minute and every hour will be spent making him understand what you did, that you are evil and to secure our future together away from you. you need to get it in your head that his future is f*cked and he is now a piece of meat that will be tossed between two people that mean everything to him but absolutely hate each other. one kidnapped him and destroyed any chance of a family and a brother/sister for him and the other is forever angry and lives every day to get revenge. thats the future and thats the truth.
11 april 2016 – soon [x] will follow every step and breath i take and he will never stray off our road together. soon he will know what his purpose in life is and what his role will be. as soon as he starts understanding it’s he and i versus you. that’s how it will remain until we return to [city d]. [x] needs to know the truth, he needs to know we hate each other and that his life is going the opposite way of all other kids. my anger will become his anger too. things will get much worse the more time passes, much worse. you will pay for kidnapping him and for our two lives separated, destroyed and scarred for good. then you will be on your own, completely to your selfish self. we guarantee you will be on your knees. hopefully you then kill yourself and leave us alone.
15 july 2016 – fine by me, i will never forget this cruelty and will be telling him every single detail of what you have done and how you behaved. don’t think for one minute that you are getting away with this. he will know how much i begged to be with him and how nasty and selfish you were.
10 november 2016 – well done for making it uglier tomorrow, [x] will love to read all this soon what you are doing will never be hidden from him, it’s his dna poor [x], not only does he know his parents hate each other but he will have everything documented to read when older how will that affect him? i know that he will hate you and never want to see you again.
28 march 2017 – carry on your way, be my guest – i don’t care but in 7 years time [x] will be sending you the same messages until he smashes you in the face and walks out on you. i look forward to that and live for that day, a 50 year old [ms padova] left on her own and with a bloodied broken nose.
20 july 2017 – you are a f*cking disgrace and i will make sure you end up on your own, if it’s the last thing i do. your own son will never set eyes on you again, that’s 100% so enjoy him all to yourself while you can. after that you might as well shoot yourself in the head because that’s how we will make you feel. enjoy for now but evil people eventually get what they deserve. 11 august 2017 – keep going, when the tables turn i will return all this with interest and remind you what you did to us. i won’t need to do anything, [x] will close the door on new himself when he realises what you did to him. 14 august 2017 – you really think you can just block me from my son? you can for now, because he is 5 years old. the older [x] gets the more things improve in my favour, then the real war starts – you think [x] won’t fight against your abuse?? when [x] knocks you out with one punch i will be the first to celebrate. 16 august 2017 – wait until [x] grows up to find out his own mother block him seeing his dad even on father’s day! 2 july 2019 – [ms padova] – after 2 years you still insist on supervised visits for no reason. i can wait until [x] is a teenager if i have to, no problem – until he tells you exactly what he thinks of what you are doing to us, runs to me and as far away from you as possible. i’ve advised you i’m attending the event, i’m not making any other arrangements with evil. you should stay clear of this event, in fact stay clear of anything to do with [x] and sports as you are clueless and you being there does him more damage than good.
your sister is a nasty and selfish piece of work. i will spend the next decade hating her and turning my son against her. during this time the biggest losers will be [x] and me. after this time she will lose and [x] will be with me. so we all lose in the end.
my anger has only increased with time as a result of her actions and will never subside until [x] and i returned to [city d]. when we returned their will be no deceit or lies, just pure open revenge and this time her son will be delivering her knockout blows and not me.
as soon as [x] is 8 or 9 i will get him a mobile phone and i will by-pass her completely so her time is running out. the tables will turn very soon. ... i’m sorry but until [x] starts fighting on behalf of me my anger will remain and no anger management course will help. ... i’m sorry but i am prepared to wait for a few years until she cant [sic] stop us being together but he will see the hatred in my eyes and i won’t hide it from him. ... when he is older i will present him with my life struggle without him – a documented account of every day without him – every day. i have a diary and spreadsheets of hell she has put me through. when he reads that he will understand the hell she has put me through and the pain and suffering i have had to endure without him. i’m sorry but he needs to know the truth, however shocking it will be by then. ... sooner or later all of this will return and he will be in the middle of it whether he likes it or not. i will want total revenge (an eye for an eye) and i will want him with me after she stole many years away from us. my anger will remain until he is with me and she never sees him again. so i suggest you advise her to change and start accommodating me and [x] otherwise that will happen and she will be staring at four walls soon – just like i have been for the last three years. i have nothing else to live for but that day.”
i came here with her to be a family man, a father and i am nothing now. nothing because of her and i nearly killed myself, even ended up in emergency and had my stomach pumped. she destroyed my life and took [x] for herself only. not once did she ask how i [sic] felt and not once did she ease off the pressure. still nothing, just more stabbing me. but i can take it now and will live for revenge, she will feel exactly like i do now and hopefully she finishes herself off then. i guarantee [x] will come to me at the first opportunity, at the age of 12. and she won’t be able to stop him legally so everything she is gathering against me now will not work when a boy a foot taller than her overpowers her and slams the door in her face.
she had the option not to see me and release [x] to [ms t] for the last 2 weekends yet she still chose not to just to piss me off further. she loves to push my anger to the limits but let me tell you something – she is lucky to be alive because i have had to hold myself back and i don’t know how i [sic] did it – i’m talking a couple years ago. so tell he [sic] is that if she carries on pushing me like she has been over the last few weeks then i cant guarantee what will happen. the exclusion from any schooling has been my final straw. she is pushing a man twice her weight and size!?!? [x] too will be my size and she will have no chance when he is older and starts going against her. you know i will encourage him against her and it wouldn’t surprise me when he punches her in the face/stabs are in her sleep if she stops him seeing me. ... i will make sure he grows up knowing [ms padova] is a complete fake and a liar and she will have nothing to offer a teenage boy – absolutely nothing. she has 0% chance keeping hold of him when older and 100% chance of him hating her. i’m sorry but it’s fighting and war until i get him back with me and i will not hold back on anything and will not lie to him about what she did and carries on doing to us. every day without my child is hell and every day i have documented for him to read and understand what his father has been going through. when the time comes he will be in shock when he reads what she has been putting me through but i will not hide the truth from him. i think you have a good feeling of what kind of force i will unleash on [x] when the time comes and he will be shocked at what she has done. from that moment he will have no option but choose one or the other (but not both). after weeks of drilling everything to him for weeks/months i am convinced 100% he comes with me and never sets his eyes on her again.[30]
your reply is disappointing as i haven’t seen [x] for 6 months due to his mother alienating me from him... ... i’ve written to the school on a number of occasions about my concern on [x]’s mental health and the impact of his mother’s actions having on the child? i am deeply concerned and so should school be. yes, his mother and i dislike each other and always will and the family court will soon decide how often i get to see [x] but until then she is intent on destroying father and son and totally blocking us seeing each other.
mr longworth: can you see how that could not possibly be in [x]’s best interest? father: yes. mr longworth: do you accept you were acting inconsistent with his best interest? father: i was still – i was still – i was still writing similar emails, yes. mr longworth: do you accept you – that your actions were inconsistent with his best interest? father: they were not consistent with his best interest. mr longworth: and do you accept that you were putting your needs before [x]’s? father: no, i don’t believe that. i – i feel that in my mind at the time, i thought that i was putting [x]’s best interests, but reading it now – looking at it now – and when – even just that first paragraph about not – you know, telling them about the mother alienating. it’s just – it’s just me playing some kind of victim card, and involving other people that really don’t want to be written. mr longworth: you are putting your interests above [x]’s? father: looking at it now, yes. mr longworth: looking at it now. but you couldn’t see that then, could you? father: i couldn’t see it then. i really couldn’t. it was – you know, it’s pretty much – it’s just a gentler version of – of some of the poor emails that i was sending at the time to the mother. mr longworth: what can you say to his honour about why his honour should believe a word of what you’re saying, as opposed to the emails and letters that you wrote to the district court judge and the local court magistrate and the club at [suburb h], when you were trying to create impressions about your insight and regret? father: okay. i mean – you know, over – over the last – over the last year, in particular – okay, i’ve stopped going to these places, and i found that it wasn’t worth going to these places at all – these [clubs], and i’ve quit [gaming]. i haven’t been for nearly two years. i haven’t been to an [club] at all since, so nearly two years. and – and – you know, it took something like that – you know, it took something like that event to really open my eyes. the event with – with getting charged.
the mother is using some kind of ridiculous technicality to attempt to alienate father and son further
as a school you are responsible to keep him stable and not further disrupt a child that is already traumatised by what his mother is doing
he probably thinks i deserted him, just what his mother wants him to think.[31]
you don’t give a fuck about anyone else but yourselves, [x] will be educated about all of you – i guarantee that. every day of this nightmare is documented and will form his teenage years, i doubt he will choose to remain with a bunch of child abusers.
for the moment it’s her when old enough to choose and when i reveal years of abuse then it’s only me and the tables turn and all of her ‘investment’ in him collapses because he will want nothing to do with her.”
the older [x] gets the harder it will be for her. i can wait but i will hit her with the same ferocity she has hit me, unfortunately [x] will remain in the middle of us fighting and this time he will support his dad, that i am 100% sure of.” and “[x] and i have learned to be patient, we thank her for that. what she’s doing will come back and bite her because she is the one promoting hatred and anger. i never want to see her again, i just want fair access to my child, something i have never had – soon the court will grant me this and she won’t be able to stop us. maybe when that happens i will probably be on the street with debts but she doesn’t matter to me because [x] will learn she did this to his dad. hopefully [x] chooses to live with me before that happens, this is the bit when we leave this country for good and she will be left on her own for good. that will happen, he and i have no future here, just bad memories and lost time together.” and “the tables will turn and revenge will be sweet, in the long term she will lose and she will feel exactly what i am feeling right now.” and “i would love to see her try to stop [x] and i being together when he is 12 or 13 years old, when he is taller and stronger than her – we all know that if she does then he will just slam the door in her face and leave. naturally i will encourage him to leave but at least it will be his choice and not hers like it is now.[33]
i took intimate photos and videos of [ms ac] [date of birth], without her knowledge and consent. i admitted that i showed these photos and videos to other people in public at 2 occasions. i admitted that it was not appropriate action and offended [ms ac]. i apologise for my action and promise that i will delete those images and videos permanently or any other content related to [ms ac] permanently in front of her on 11/02/2019. ... by signing this statement, [ms ac] agrees to terminate any legal action relating to this offence but reserves the right to continue the legal action if i continue to possess these intimate images and videos taken without her knowledge and consent, or i continue to exhibit the photos and videos to others, distribute, or upload online no matter whether on social media or websites.
there is no excuse for what i did, i made poor choices and i absolutely take full responsibility for my terrible actions and the pain i have caused to [ms ac].
with – you’re with someone, you don’t always need to ask for consent, if you’re seeing someone. i – i don’t ask [x] for his consent if i take a photo, so i don’t know how to answer that.
i did it to – to upset her, because she walked in with her ex-boyfriend pretty much an hour after threatening me, and – and – and i – i just reacted, so, – so this was – this is the problem that i’ve had.
i have also been advised to submit the recent psychiatrist findings/report so that my actions can be taken into account and your harsh final warning reconsidered (i left a copy with [redacted] last week).
no he didn’t read the report. i – i – i explained that i had – i – i asked – i asked if – if – if i can ...
i did. i did. i did write that. yes. three years ago, yes. it was – it was a time when i was upset. i will delete that tonight. i will take that off. i didn’t mean to do that.
i say that the mother would provoke me at times so that i would react and the evidence could be collected against me so that the mother could secure [x] to herself.
i believe the same issue happened during the recordings provided by the mother, they were premeditated and planned in advance.
every email from you is a disappointment and negative for [x]. absolutely no movement from you. no matter how many courses i do, no matter how many good contacts with [x] take place and no matter how many good communications we have, 3 years of this, and you still carry on putting yourself first and our sons needs last. i more than once inform you of the damage your causing [x], and you carry on knowing your relationship with him will deteriorate over time and you just think about yourself
i can’t pay for [b contact centre] supervision if i can be out of work any day now. i don’t have any savings. why don’t you explain to [x] your father can’t see him anymore? also telling it could be months before he sees his dad, or at least 10 years. i can’t wait till he’s 18. no problem for me at all that would kill him. sorry, you would kill him.
and if his father were removed from his life to the extent that he only saw his father very occasionally and then under supervision, say, 3 or 4 times a year for recognition type contact in a contact centre, i want to suggest to you that that would be quite devastating for your son?
the mother replied:
i think he would be sad
and agreed that x would be sad for a long time and that he would find it difficult to understand and comprehend.
dr e – the expert’s evidence  from the interview with x individually:
asked to describe his parents, [x] opined mum was “kind and nice”. however, he said he could not describe dad because he “can’t think about him, don’t see him much”. if he had the choice of “less/more/the same as now” (i.e. at school) time with dad, [x] thought he would like more time with him, to “go out with him”. to a query about staying overnight with dad, he said “no”. stating he would want another person with them while they were together, [x] explained this would “feel comfortable”. he said he did not know why he felt this way ... to a query if dad hurt [his mother], he said “only once... slapped and gave her a big bruise”, which he knew about as mum showed him it on her arm ... he said he slept in his own bed and “sometimes... in holiday time” he slept with mum. (2) from the observation of x with the father: smiling, [x] reunited with his father in the office by briefly flopping onto him comfortably and greeting him before moving to sit beside him. (3) from dr e’s interview with the mother: asked what outcome she hoped for from the proceedings, [ms padova] responded “[x] loves his dad, enjoys seeing him... i need something where [x] can see him in a safe setting and (which is) conducive to a relationship”. (4) from dr e’s interview with the father: [the father] tended to minimise when pressed on some of his past behaviours. he reported he agreed with the judge during the interim hearing in june 2019 that he threatened to turn [x] against his mother, and explained he was “trying to do reverse psychology, to get her to be fair” ... he expressed concerns [ms padova] and “random men” have “emotional(ly), mental(ly) and psychological(ly) abused” [x] ... acknowledging that, between 2015 and 2017, he said he “would take ([x]) off ([ms padova]) and he will never want to see her again and that i would take him back to england and away from her”, [mr mancari] reported he wrote those emails “because (he) was desperate” ... continuing, [mr mancari] asserted he now understood “denigrating to the child is bad” and he “will never denigrate in the future” ... he seemed to want to discuss whether the anger management course was necessary ... emphasising he has changed, [mr mancari] asserted he has “learnt”.
... opined when they separated she allowed him to have minimal time with [x] “for no reason ... she thinks (he) will ‘educate’ [x] against her and take him to england”
he reported he has never been fired from a job nor had discipline reaction in the workplace. he generally had no problems with his colleagues, although he mentioned once “snap(ping)” and a female colleague, with the incident later being resolved.
do you think it would have been more correct to tell [[dr e]] that over the two to three preceding years you had had five to six occasions where either someone from a senior position had told you you had to modify your behaviour or a colleague had interfered and told you to – and pulled you up? do you think it would have been more appropriate and a more accurate answer to tell [dr e] that?
to which the father answered “yes, i think so.”  e mother] is [[x’s]] primary caregiver and at the top of his attachment hierarchy. any threat to her will be experienced by x as a threat to him. of note, when seen with [mr mancari], [x] wanted [ms padova] to stay in the same building. it was unclear whether this was to reassure him or her or both of them. he has no history of separation anxiety. [x] witnessed his father’s aggressive behaviour towards his mother on at least one occasion (the aeroplane trip from [city d] in 2015) ... in 2015 [x] was 3 years old, an age when long-term memories may form but be retained as emotional fragments. the harmful effects of family violence on the child are well-established in the relevant literature, which finds that children who witness violence experienced the same level of negative outcomes as children directly experience physical abuse. included in parental behaviours which constitute child abuse are those by which one parent actively or passively, consciously or unconsciously, undermines a child’s relationship with the other parent. currently, [x] has a limited, cautious relationship with his father, not wanting to spend time alone with him. his mother has consistently described him enjoying time with his father, whom he loved. [x] expressed a wish to spend more time with [his father] and do more activities with him but did not want overnight time. he thought another person accompanying them would make him “feel comfortable”. as [x] did not disclose any abuse experiences perpetrated by [mr mancari], his wish to limit time with him probably reflected his awareness of his mother’s anxieties any remnant fears aroused in him by the family violence any ongoing uncomfortable experiences such as likely occurred when [mr mancari] questioned him in the school toilets. at age seven, [x] does not have the maturity to be able to evaluate what living arrangements are in his best interest, that is, beneficial to him and which minimise his exposure to predictable risks of harm. [in relation to the mother] she has capacity to meet [[x’s]] age-appropriate needs and his particular individual needs. [ms padova] expressed ongoing fear of [mr mancari’s] future behaviours. her anxiety is understandable given his actions in 2019. [in relation to the father] at this point, he is capable of providing for [[x’s]] physical and educational needs. [the father] impressed as having a limited capacity for self-reflection and understanding the impact of his poor behaviour on others. he has not been convinced by his honour’s findings from the interim hearing. of note, stress is likely to exacerbate the adhd symptoms. he appeared to perceive imperfect situations where the fault of others ... markedly concerning was his statement [ms padova] “put [x] in many situations of conflict” (page 15, this report) by attending handovers. he externalised the responsibility of his resulting aggressive behaviour, blaming her. clearly an intelligent man, [mr mancari] demonstrated his lack of critical thinking when emotionally overwhelmed. at these times he is frequently poorly emotionally regulated and does not make use of diffusion skills to manage his strong feelings. while feeling angry, frustrated, slighted (unfairly treated), [mr mancari] has a long-term pattern of retaliating with bullying, coercive, intimidating words and/or threats, evident in his emails attached to the 6 february affidavit of [ms f], the subpoenaed documents from the [suburb h] [club] and [ms g’s] recount of his behaviour on the flight in 2015 ... . in his emails, [mr mancari] does not demonstrate any regard for [ms padova] or [x] when he repeatedly threatens with graphic, dramatic, at times violent language to undermine their relationship. he has continued to be unaware of his projections, believing he is that hapless victim of her “alienation” of [x] and was “framed, set-up and then isolated from [x]” (email dated 17 august 2018). while [mr mancari]reported he was no longer the wounded, grieving person who wrote the emails between 2017 – 2018, he has demonstrated other actions which question his integrity, for example the events in early 2019 around the photographs of [ms ac], which he initially said he took with her permission before acknowledging he did not have it. future behaviour in a person is difficult to predict, with past behaviour is generally considered an imperfect but best available guide for predicting the future. if [mr mancari] continues with past actions, the benefits of him parenting [x] will need to outweigh the risks of harm (as described by judge morley). clearly, if he is unable to make changes, the aim of his relationship with [x] needs to be considered: will it be to fulfil all the roles of an adequate parent (significant time) or only to meet identificatory needs (four times a year and at a contact centre) or reality testing purposes (monthly)?

... because it was unclear to me what would be the best scenario for [x]. i was significantly concerned about [mr mancari] and what i had read and how he had presented to me on – and i believe he needed to make some changes. ... he seems to have become less – not volatile – less – less aggressive in his communications with [x’s] mum. i don’t think he has done away with all his aggression. i still believe he – he can be volatile, that he still is unable to see things from [x’s] mother’s perspective. i think he’s still reasonably self-absorbed. ... so am i any clearer about what would be in young [x’s] best interests in terms of time with his father? it – there is still so many factors that i think are unpredictable and – and i think that’s part of my concerns, how predictable is [mr mancari]. there are – there is evidence, since i saw them, of various correspondence and behaviours which show me that he still can be impulsive, he still can be self-absorbed, and that concerns me.
... in his latest affidavit, he also said, you know, “i didn’t make any threats”, which i couldn’t quite understand because there are those audio recordings where he very calmly is saying things which made my blood chill anyway.
... the father projecting on – his thoughts and feelings onto [x] and how [x] becomes an extension of him rather than [x] having his own person
i think it is revealing something about [mr mancari’s] failure to be – 2 – well, put it another way, [mr mancari’s] acceptance that being angry and therefore being aggressive is an acceptable way of being that most of us – we all get angry. we all learn, i trust – well, we need to learn that we can’t be aggressive and that we can’t just spray our anger on somebody else, that we need to do something with that anger and process it and then communicate it in a way that is a civil discourse. but to just repeatedly give yourself permission to be – to talk like this, i think is – is – is a very dangerous personality fault – a personality fault – defect.   whether the aggressive, intimidating behaviour has continued, (2) even if that behaviour has not continued, whether the attitude underlying behaviour is still there, (3) whether there is evidence that the father accepts responsibility for his past behaviours, (4) whether there is evidence that shows that he has some insight into the impact of his past behaviours on the mother, and (5) whether the father has personality issues that make him more prone to aggressive or intimidating behaviour.   even if that behaviour has not continued, whether the attitude underlying behaviour is still there, (3) whether there is evidence that the father accepts responsibility for his past behaviours, (4) whether there is evidence that shows that he has some insight into the impact of his past behaviours on the mother, and (5) whether the father has personality issues that make him more prone to aggressive or intimidating behaviour.   whether there is evidence that the father accepts responsibility for his past behaviours, (4) whether there is evidence that shows that he has some insight into the impact of his past behaviours on the mother, and (5) whether the father has personality issues that make him more prone to aggressive or intimidating behaviour.   whether there is evidence that shows that he has some insight into the impact of his past behaviours on the mother, and (5) whether the father has personality issues that make him more prone to aggressive or intimidating behaviour.   whether the father has personality issues that make him more prone to aggressive or intimidating behaviour.   how well controlled his adhd is “because certainly impulsivity is another issue you would sort of need to think about if you’re looking at dangerousness”, and (2) any ongoing misuse by the father of alcohol, in terms of considering a person who is prone to losing control and behaving in a dangerous way.   any ongoing misuse by the father of alcohol, in terms of considering a person who is prone to losing control and behaving in a dangerous way.
well i think there’s the benefit of [x] knowing that dad is interested in him, that his father loves him, that his father hasn’t lost interest ... he has a positive experience with the playful father who delights in him and i think it’s great for a child to have that experience, that you delight your parent. ... that’s maintaining a connection with a father he has had very little time with, i appreciate that, and it stops and starts and it is not a lot of time but there is still – they’re still that sort of real connection. ... by and large, [mr mancari] is very loving to [x] and [x] enjoys that. so i think those experiences are very positive for [x].
... if there is a good relationship between the child and the parent then having ongoing but not intense time or regular time, but having something like a monthly time would help the child not feel abandoned by the parent, that it reassures the child the parent still loves them and the reason why he is not seeing the child more often is the judge’s fault. and one would hope they would have a more mature reason than that, but that sort of is the sense of it – ‘i really do want to be with you. it’s just i am not able to because of the circumstances’.
... clearly you don’t have the secure attachment at this point because the parent isn’t easily available to the child, but you still have some sort of connection attachment that can be built on when the child is autonomous and ... [x] can meet up with his father on his own terms at that point. so you got the foundation there that – and that connection. and it doesn’t leave [x] with the sense of, you know, ‘dad kept on telling me he loved me and then he just disappeared, you know. because he didn’t love me.’ or ‘i must’ve been lacking. i must have been wanting in some way and he didn’t want me as a son any more.’ you know, ‘he found another partner who had a child and he preferred that child.’ i mean, there’s lots of narratives i could imagine he might tell himself.

future behaviour in a person is difficult to predict, with past behaviours are generally considered and imperfect but best available guide for predicting the future.
... the father’s conduct of various points in time, but particularly around 2015/2016, was absolutely unacceptable. and there is no getting away from that. nor is there any escaping the fact that his conduct has had an impact on the mother and quite a serious impact. and it doesn’t in some respects matter whether he believed that deep down the mother knew that he was never going to harm himself or her or their child, [x]. the fact that the mother was exposed to that sort of toxicity in her home was entirely unacceptable. the father has some difficulties with his personality. there is no getting away from that. he has difficulties at work. he has had difficulties at the [club]. he has had difficulties with police. he has been involved with the authorities, including being before the court and he has dealings with corrective services. and his behaviour at times has been immature. it has been inappropriate, and he hasn’t fully appreciated his impact on other people.
when the time comes, i will live and breathe revenge
and to the father’s assertions in his oral evidence that he was reformed man, that he had obtained an understanding of the errors of his ways. mr longworth submitted that though it was impossible to know the truth of the father’s assertions, the court does not have to know, but, rather, the court is to assess the risks and weigh the probabilities and the possibilities, and that in doing so the court should look to the clear evidence in the father’s supplementary affidavit completed the day before the hearing began as showing that the father had not achieved any such understanding, and that therefore the risk was there and the risk was an unacceptable risk.
he is capable of saying some dreadful things, obscene things, horrible things, damaging things, but in terms of acting on any of that, in my submission, the clear evidence is that he would never act on those threats.

a discretionary judgment concerning the parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[47]   assess whether that risk is an acceptable risk or an unacceptable risk, (2) if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   if it is assessed that it is an unacceptable risk, assess whether or not the risk can be mitigated by appropriate orders, and (3) decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.   decide what orders are proper in all the circumstances in the best interests of the child.  ] in considering an allegation of sexual abuse, the court should not make a positive finding that the allegation is true unless the court is so satisfied according to the civil standard of proof, with due regard to the factors mentioned in briginshaw v briginshaw [1938] hca 34, (1938) 60 clr 336 at 362 ... [23] no doubt there will be some cases in which the court is able to come to a positive finding that the allegation is well-founded. in all but the most extraordinary cases, that finding will have a decisive impact on the order to be made respecting custody and access. there will be cases also in which the court has no hesitation in rejecting the allegation as groundless ... [24] in resolving the wider issue the court must determine whether on the evidence there is a risk of sexual abuse occurring if custody or access be granted and assessing the magnitude of that risk. after all, in deciding what is in the best interests of a child, the family court is frequently called upon to assess and evaluate the likelihood or possibility of events or occurrences which, if they come about, will have a detrimental impact on the child's welfare. the existence and magnitude of the risk of sexual abuse, as with other risks of harm to the welfare of a child, is a fundamental matter to be taken into account in deciding issues of custody and access. in access cases, the magnitude of the risk may be less if the order in contemplation is supervised access ... [25] ... in devising these tests the courts have endeavoured, in their efforts to protect the child's paramount interests, to achieve a balance between the risk of detriment to the child from sexual abuse and the possibility of benefit to the child from parental access. to achieve a proper balance, the test is best expressed by saying that a court will not grant custody or access to a parent if that custody or access would expose the child to an unacceptable risk of sexual abuse.  1] ... we accept as a matter of practice, a trial judge will almost inevitably be required in a case where sexual abuse allegations are raised to consider whether abuse has been proven on the balance of probabilities as well as considering whether or not an unacceptable risk of abuse exists ...  ] in his recent paper entitled ‘unacceptable risk – a return to basics’ the hon. john fogarty a.m. set out his summary of the principles emerging from m and m as follows:
1 the decisive issue is and always remains the best interests of that child. all other issues are subservient. 2 the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable. 3 where past abuse of a child is alleged it is usually neither necessary nor desirable to reach a definitive conclusion on that issue. where, however, that is done the briginshaw civil standard of proof applies. 4 the circumstance, if it be so, that the allegation of past abuse is not proved in accordance with briginshaw, does not impede reliance upon those circumstances in determining whether there is an unacceptable risk. 5 the concentration in these cases should normally be upon the question whether there is an unacceptable risk to the child. 6 the onus of proof in reaching that conclusion is the ordinary civil standard. 7 but the components which go to make up that conclusion need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of unacceptable risk from the accumulation of factors, none or some only of which, are proved to that standard.
and thereafter expanded some points contained in the summary.  ] frequently, (i would respectfully venture, too frequently) “risk” is referred to as an all-embracing term, a “general” finding of which can (purportedly) be seen to have some form of “ipso facto consequences” for the orders made. yet, “risk” is, without more, but a convenient description, orders must, surely, address its constituent components which must, axiomatically, vary according to the circumstances of each case. [72] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said:
risk assessment in any situation involves, in essence, the asking of the following questions: (1) what harmful outcome is potentially present in this situation? (2) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (3) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (4) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (5) what measures are available whose deployment could mitigate the risks that are probable? (b. mahendra, 'psychiatric risk assessment in family and child law' (2008) 38 family law 569).  ] mr fogarty, writing in the australian journal of family law said this (20 ajfl 249 at 254-5):
... the reality is that all courts deal with issues of "risk" and degrees of risk (however described) in various situations and that concept is increasingly used in legislation. risk is difficult to define in a way which is not ultimately circular. but it is an inevitable part of life at all its levels. it is inherently risky to breathe, eat, drink, walk, drive, work, invest and play. the world is full of different risks and consequences and everyone is prone to dangers. we confront varying levels of risk everyday. people frequently face potentially dangerous situations, not many live at home in complete isolation to avoid getting in harms way. most people try to avoid what they perceive to be risk, some willingly take on high risk activities. risk involves two component, the degree of "likelihood" of the happening of an event, and the possible consequences (good or bad) if it does [cases and citations omitted]. individuals in their assessment of some risks may focus more on one than the other of these components. but at some point it usually becomes necessary for that person to make a judgment of the risk and whether it can/should be taken. where the risk relates to a third person to whom one owes a responsibility, it is likely in the nature of things that the estimate will be conservative. risks are relative and usually involve trade-offs. crossing the road with oncoming traffic to catch the last connection to the airport involves the risk of being hit by a car or the risk of missing the plane. very much a balancing exercise of facts, experience and intuition, but essentially which risk carries the greater detriment (usually the car). then there is the common experience of a mother watching her child cross a road to go to school. the risk is seen as greater (although it may not be) because the consequences may be death or injury to the child and because the responsibilities of the mother will be seen by her as greater than for herself or another adult .... at times the courts and the legislature have attempted to give an indication of the content or quality of the risk -- otherwise “risk” may mean any risk, however small or unlikely. hence the use of adjectives such as “serious”, “grave”, “real”, “appreciable” and “unacceptable”.  ] i respectfully agree, as i also do with mr fogarty's statement (which also has echoes in the english author's statement earlier quoted) that:
... unacceptable risk in the high court's formulation [in m v m (1988) 166 clr 69] requires two separate steps. is there a risk, and is it unacceptable? the concentration by the high court is upon both the nature and the degree of risk in the particular case. its formulation is all about balance. in some cases a risk is "acceptable" when balanced against other factors and other orders. the object of safeguards is to convert an unacceptable situation to an acceptable one where that is feasible and is of "benefit to the child". it is, as i suggested earlier, calibrated to its use in individual cases. it is unrelated to the exoneration or otherwise of the alleged abuser, it is all about the bests interests of the child and protection from risk
in napier & hepburn [2006] famca 1316, the full court emphasised that it is not for the court to find a solution which will eliminate any chance of serious harm. rather, it is to balance the harm that will follow if the risk is not minimised or removed, as against a normal, healthy relationship between a parent and a child not being permitted to prosper.  m v m put beyond doubt the proposition that courts exercising jurisdiction under pt vii of the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”) must protect children from credible risks of harm due to sexual abuse. such risks, like all prospective events, are capable of classification in only one of three mutually exclusive categories: possibilities, probabilities, or certainties. once it is accepted courts should (and do) react to dangers in the form of risks of harm which may merely be possibilities, it is an oxymoron to expect such possibilities to then be forensically proven on the balance of probabilities according to the civil standard of proof. by definition, possibilities are not, and could never be, probabilities. risks of harm are not susceptible of scientific demonstration or proof (cdj v vaj (1998) 197 clr 172 at [151]), but are instead postulated from known historical facts and present circumstances. ... [85] the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment (edwards v noble (1971) 125 clr 296 at 304), though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result (norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513 at 518). the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s 60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one. [86] we have already acknowledged how risks of harm are not susceptible of empirical proof, but a mathematical hypothetical will nevertheless illustrate how findings of “unacceptable risk” cannot be measured by the civil standard of proof. imagine a child will be minded by one of three randomly allocated carers. assume one of the carers would sexually abuse the child, but the other two would not, meaning the child stands a 33.33 per cent chance of being sexually abused if left in care. no sensible adult would take the risk of leaving the child in care because, even though the prospect of sexual abuse is only possible but not probable, the risk is still too high to tolerate. in other words, it is unacceptable. if parents (and courts) were to instead only react to risks which are probabilities then, in that example, the child would still be left in care unless shown he or she was susceptible to sexual abuse by two of the three carers and the risk was then rated at 66.66 per cent.
section 60cc – the primary considerations
is there benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both parents? ] what these definitions convey is that “meaningful”, when used in the context of “meaningful relationship”, is synonymous with “significant” which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for “important” or “of consequence”. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.  ] the act sets out in s 60cc several matters for the court to consider in determining what is in the child’s best interests but does not seek to mandate that any one or other matter becomes determinative in any particular case. for the purposes of this case the legislation requires that there be a primary consideration given to the benefit of the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents but it does not purport to prescribe how that meaningful relationship is best promoted in the circumstances of any one case.  ] it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.  0] ...to be a meaningful relationship, it must be healthy, worthwhile and advantageous to the child... those adjectives mean that children need their parents to lead by example about self-discipline. children need to learn to develop the ability to relate to others. they need to learn about the privileges and responsibility which will devolve upon them as parents. those are fundamental parts of the meaningful relationship ...  ] we accept that the benefit to be derived by a child from sibling relationships is not a matter which could be the subject of judicial notice within s144 of the evidence act 1995(cth), ...
it is not open to a judge to use section 144 of the evidence act to “inform” him or herself of matters in respect of which reasonable minds might differ.
is there a risk to x in spending unsupervised time with his father, and, if so, is it an unacceptable risk?
clearly an intelligent man, [mr mancari] demonstrated his lack of critical thinking when emotionally overwhelmed. at these times he is frequently poorly emotionally regulated and does not make use of diffusion skills to manage his strong feelings. while feeling angry, frustrated, slighted (unfairly treated), [mr mancari] has a long-term pattern of retaliating with bullying, coercive, intimidating words and oblique or threats, evident in his email is attached to the 6 february affidavit of [ms f], the subpoenaed documents from the [suburb h club] and [ms g’s] recount of his behaviour on the flight [in] 2015 (or affidavit dated 10 october 2018). in the emails, [mr mancari] does not demonstrate any regard for [ms padova] or [x] when he repeatedly threatens with graphic, dramatic, at times violent language to undermine their relationship. he has continued to be unaware of his projections, believing he is the hapless victim of her “alienation” of [x] and was “framed, set-up and then isolated from [x]” (email dated 17 august 2018). while [mr mancari] reported he was no longer the wounded, grieving person who wrote the emails between 2017-2018, he has demonstrated other actions which question his integrity, for example the events in early 2019 around the photographs of [ms ac], which he initially said he took with her permission before acknowledging he did not have it. future behaviour in a person is difficult to predict, with past behaviours generally considered an imperfect but best available guide for predicting the future. if [mr mancari] continues with past actions, benefits of him parenting [x] will need to outweigh the risks of harm... . clearly, if he is unable to make changes, the aim of his relationship with [x] needs to be considered: will it be to fulfil all the roles of an adequate parent (significant time) or only to meet identificatory needs (four times a year in a contact centre) or reality testing purposes (monthly)?
so am i any clearer about what would be in young [x’s] best interests in terms of time with his father? it – there’s still so many factors that i think are unpredictable and – and i think that’s part of my concerns, how predictable is [mr mancari]. there are – there is evidence, since i saw them, of various correspondence and behaviours which show that he still can be impulsive, he still can be self-absorbed, and that concerns me.[48]
section 60cc – the additional considerations.
any views expressed by x and any factors such as x’s maturity or level of understanding that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to x’s views
if he had a choice of “less/more/the same is now” (i.e. at school) time with dad, [x] thought he would like more time with him, to “go out with him”. to a query about staying overnight with dad, he said “no”. stating he would want another person with them while they were together, [x] explained this would “feel comfortable”. he said he did not know why he felt this way. asked how mum felt when she sees dad, [x] responded “scared, she is quite scared of my dad”.
the nature of the relationship of x with each of his parents
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to x, to spend time with x, and to communicate with x
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligation to maintain x
the likely effect of any change in x circumstances, including the likely effect on x of any separation from either of his parents  x spend time with him unsupervised for eight hours each alternate saturday for three months, then (2) increasing periods of overnight time on an alternate weekend basis, until (3) a final arrangement of five consecutive overnights with the father each fortnight and half of each school holiday period is reached.   increasing periods of overnight time on an alternate weekend basis, until (3) a final arrangement of five consecutive overnights with the father each fortnight and half of each school holiday period is reached.   a final arrangement of five consecutive overnights with the father each fortnight and half of each school holiday period is reached.
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with his father and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect x’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of x’s parents to provide for the needs of x, including emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of either of x’s parents, and any other characteristics of x that the court thinks are relevant
the attitude to x, and the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of x’s parents
any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of x’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in the proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
indefinite supervision
ms shea: if, in the light of all the evidence, the court does not accept that the father has changed and finds that he continues to pose an unacceptable risk to [x], is there any benefit in – to [x] in a continuation of supervised time? so if he hasn’t changed, he still risk, is there any benefit? [dr e]: well i think there’s the benefit of [x] knowing that dad is interested in him, that his father loves him, that his father hasn’t lost interest – i’ve already said that – through that – through his father, he has – is able to have contact with his english relatives. he has a positive experience with the playful father who delights in him and i think it’s great for a child to have that experience, that you delight your parent. so i think that – that’s maintaining a connection with a father he has had very little time with. i appreciate that, and it stops and starts and it’s not a lot of time but there still – they’re still that sort of real connection. you can – he can hug him, they can have – they enjoy each other. by and large, you know, i’ve picked out a few things in the contact that i am critical of, but by and large, [mr mancari] is very loving to [x] and [x] enjoys that. so i think those experiences are very positive for [x]. ms shea: are there some potential negatives in – in a long-term supervised arrangement? [dr e]: well i know a lot of children get tired of going – having to go to contact, that they don’t like it when it interferes with their other activities. of course, there is limited time he has with his father, so he – and he wishes for him to have more time with his dad, well be – it being thwarted. that might mean he will push away more from mum, if he feels – if he tends to blame her and i mentioned, you know, is getting older and particularly as a young teen, if – where he needs to start separating away from mum, will he push away and think that, you know, it’s all your fault i’m not seeing my father and – and that can create situations. i mean, worst case scenario is, you know, i know my dad loves me. he wants me. i’m going to go and live with him and so, young [x] ups stumps and heads off on his way.[52]   e]: ... in my report, i talked about monthly, so that there would be some reality checking. i do have a worry when children don’t have any contact with a parent, and particularly if the parent there with’s negative towards the other parent, then the opposite happens. instead of the parent being idealised, then the parent – then there is a demonisation of the parent. ms shea: this is if there is no time? [dr e]: if there is no time, there is no contact and you’re just living with – living with a parent who thinks negatively about the other parent, then the child – the parent – the absent parent is – can be idealised or demonised and the demonisation is not – is not very healthy for the child either. i mean, i’m now going to go on and talk about how child forms and identity and they use – identify with a parent and you will see children who – who can identify with the idealised father or the demonised father and that becomes part of who they think about – how they think about themselves, how they see themselves. ms shea: so does that mean, in your opinion, an order for no time between [x] and his father would be worse for [x] than an order for some limited supervised time? [dr e]: i believe so.[53]   e]: ... i know from my experience that for people growing up feeling like a parent has abandoned them, it leaves a very deep pain. so if the child starts off and has the close relationship with a parent, it’s not all abusive, that there are some good things. there are – there is an attachment between the child and the parent, that once a month, i think, can reinforce, you know, “i’m around, [x]. i am – i’m – i still love you. i am, you know – i wish circumstances were different but this is the way things are at the moment. it’s not your fault.” i think [x] really needs to hear that message, if this is the way – if this is the way things pan out, it’s not your fault. there’s – i haven’t read any research on this so it’s probably more my hope than anything, that the child won’t feel abandoned by the parent. that the child will know the parent loves them. there will be grief there because they won’t be seeing their parents so much but the parents still loves me and hasn’t abandoned me. because once a – the child starts thinking of – in terms of been abandoned, very often it comes back, “i’ve been abandoned because i’m not a lovable and good person and then we get a very negative self-image there.[54]
... the concept of time being supervised indefinitely into the future, until the child becomes old enough or big enough, is something which is not indicated, that we should either stop the supervision or stop the time
to which dr e responded:
well, i thought i had answered this before when i talked about how, if there is a good relationship between the child and a parent, then having ongoing but not – not intense time or – or regular time but having something like a monthly time would help the child not to feel abandoned by the parent, that that – and i just go back to my answer then, that it – it reassures the child the parents love them and – and the reason why he or she is not seeing the child more often is the judges fault. and one would hope that they would have a more mature reason than that, but that sort of sense of its – i really do want to be with you. it’s just i am not able to because of the circumstances.
is what you’re saying rather than that stark choice between indefinite supervision and no time at all, just lessen the frequency so that the child knows the parent is still around, still interested?
to which dr e replied
that’s my thinking about it, your honour. and it – and it – clearly you don’t have the secure attachment at this point because the parent isn’t easily available to the child, but you still have some sort of connection attachment that can be built on when the child is autonomous and can – and can meet up with the – well, in this case [x] can meet up with his father on his own terms at that point. so you’ve got that foundation there that – and that connection. and it doesn’t leave [x] with the sense of, you know, “dad kept on telling me he loved me and then he just disappeared, you know. of course he didn’t love me.” or “i must’ve been lacking. i must’ve been wanting in some way and he didn’t want me as a son any more.” you know, “he found another partner who had a child and he preferred that child.” i mean, there’s lots of narratives i could imagine he might tell himself.[55]
supervised access is not appropriate as a long-term measure. ... supervisors must be available to the children for safety and support and be prepared to intervene on the children’s behalf if an issue of protection arises during the visit. it is, in our opinion, unrealistic to expect a supervisor to undertake those responsibilities on a regular weekly or fortnightly basis for an indefinite period.[56]   should the father bring a further application asking for the provision in relation to supervision at the contact centre be removed, his case doubtless would be met with an assertion that he may not do so because there have [sic] been no change in circumstances (rice & asplund). ... [10] in my view, where an order is made that the time a parent spends with a child be under supervision indeterminately, there would need to be cogent reasons to support such orders ...  9] the undesirability of, and the practical difficulties associated with long term supervision in a children’s contact centre are referred to in the guideline for family law courts and children’s contact services january 2007, part c 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 (published by the attorney-general’s department, the family court of australia and the federal magistrates court of australia). in fitzpatrick & fitzpatrick [2005] famca 394, (2005) flc 93-227, may j, having found that the evidence in the case “objectively viewed reveals the potential for an unacceptable risk to the children if contact with the father is not supervised...”, then referred to the difficulty associated with long term supervised contact and said “the necessity for contact to be supervised apparently indefinitely leads to the need to finely balance what is in the children’s best interests”. her honour then explained “[w]hilst supervised contact in this case will protect the children from any potential physical harm, the effect on their emotional well-being cannot be ignored”. (see also w & w [abuse allegations: unacceptable risk] [2005] famca 892, (2005) flc 93-235, (2005) 34 fam lr 129 at paragraph 114).
while the making of orders for supervised time is an exercise of discretion, statements from the full court of this court have sought to give specific guidance where such orders are to be made for an indefinite or indeterminate period ....  8] i have found no merit in any ground of appeal, however, i am troubled by the circumstances that the effect of the orders made by the trial judge is that following the initial 12 month period of the children spending no time with the mother, there is to be supervised time that continues indefinitely. there are of course the notations to the orders recording that the icl may “arrange for the parties to attend family dispute resolution or restore the matter to the list to consider the establishment of other time arrangements between the children and the mother”, upon being provided with a report of a therapist who has treated the mother for a period of not less than 12 months, but that is not an order of the court, and he leaves it entirely in the discretion of the icl whether or not to restore the matter to the list (even if that could be done). thus, it does not operate to necessarily bring an end to the ongoing regime of supervised time if that is appropriate. [259] the difficulty with that in this case is ... her honour provides no reasons for ordering the indefinite supervision of time, and it has long been the case that to put such an order in place there must be cogent reasons for doing so (e.g. see moose & moose ... , h v k [2001] famca 687, and slater v light ... .  0] the making of orders for supervised time occurs within a broad discretion referenced to the children’s best interests exercised within mandatory statutory considerations. the conditions or limitations which might attach to orders for supervised time – and, indeed whether any conditions or limitations should attach at all – involves the exercise of that broad discretion just as much as the making of any other parenting order. [291] “final” orders for supervised time carry inherently the prospect of future alteration, no parenting order is a final order in the usual sense in which that expression is used. despite the statutory desire evident in s 60cc(3)(l), a “final” parenting order is always necessarily susceptible to later being “discharge[d], varie[d], suspend[ed] or revive[d]” in whole or in part. the act provides specifically for that possibility and gives the parties rights accordingly (s 65d(2), conditional, relevantly, upon satisfaction of the “rule in rice v asplund”). [292] as a consequence of the factors just referred to, it cannot be said that the failure to provide an end point for supervised time is, of itself, an error of either principle or discretion (see, for example, h & k, fitzpatrick and fitzpatrick [2005] famca 394, (2005) flc 93-227, moose & moose, slater v light). [293] however, the full court has sought to provide “specific guidance where [orders for supervised time] are to be made for an indefinite or indeterminate period” (slater v light at [38]). the “guidance” is of long standing and has frequently been applied. that the full court can issue guidelines as to the exercise of relevant discretions is not in doubt, but guidelines are to be distinguished from binding principles of law (norbis & norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513, per mason and deane jj. compare brennan j and see the discussion (within the context of s 79 of the act)) in hoffman & hoffman [2014] famcafc 92, (2014) flc 93-591:
...guidance must be given in a way that preserves, so far as it is possible to do so, the capacity of the family court to do justice according to the needs of the individual case, whatever its complications may be. reconciliation of these goals suggests that in most, if not all, cases the full court of the family court should give guidance in the form of guidelines rather than binding principles of law [norbis at 520]. (emphasis omitted) thus, any such guidance must guide the exercise of discretion, not replace it. the failure to follow binding principles of law constitutes an error of law, the failure to observe guidelines flags the possibility of discretionary error: it “can throw a question mark over the trial judge’s decision and ease the appellant’s burden of showing it is wrong” (norbis, above).  4] as to the content of the relevant guideline, may j said in moose v moose:  ] in my view, where an order is made that the time a parent spends with a child be under supervision indeterminately, there would need to be cogent reasons to support such orders. apart from expressing, quite properly, a concern about the mother’s emotional reaction to the children seeing their father which was consistent with the evidence (t/s p 135) his honour did not provide reasons to support these orders. in addition, his honour should have made orders which would allow for some review of the situation in the future as suggested by the family consultant. for those reasons i would allow the appeal and order a rehearing. (emphasis added)  5] to similar effect, in slater v light the full court concluded:  ] flowing from this finding, his honour was correct to find that an order for supervised time should be made. we do consider appealable error has been made out however in ground 3, as an indefinite supervision order was not justified in the circumstances and in any event was not substantiated by sufficient reasons. it is also relevant to the success of this ground that the orders did not at least provide an opportunity for the father to apply to vary the supervision arrangements at a later time. that the father could bring such an application is no solution given that on the basis of rice and asplund he would need to establish significant changed circumstances before being permitted to have his case heard on the merits. (emphasis added)  6] it appears that the guideline stems from a premise founded in the “undesirability of, and the practical difficulties associated with, long term supervision in a children’s contact centre” and the impact each and both might have on the welfare of the children concerned (boland j in moose, cited with apparent approval in slater v light and referring to “guideline for family law courts and children’s contact services, january 2007 ... published by the attorney-general’s department, the family court of australia and the federal magistrates court of australia). [297] the guideline would appear to contain four components. first, while a failure to limit supervision is not itself an error, the failure to consider a limitation upon it may constitute an error in the exercise in discretion. second is the necessity to give “cogent” reasons. thirdly, and in practical effect alternatively, is the apparent necessity for the orders to “allow for some review of the situation in the future”. fourthly is the need to give reasons reflective of the consideration of those issues. [298] as to the necessity for “cogent” reasons, in my view, reasons for judgment are either adequate to explain the exercise of discretion or they are not. inadequate reasons might attract appellate intervention – adequate reasons do not. reasons that are adequate at law might ipso facto be thought to be “cogent”. to the extent that any additional burden is intended to be placed upon a trial judge’s reasons by use of the word “cogent”, such burden is not referenced to any authority or statement of principle and i cannot, respectfully, see how any intended additional burden is justified in principle. however, as the reference to “sufficient” reasons in the passage quoted above from the later decision in slater v light suggests, the use of the word “cogent” is, as it respectfully seems to me, intended merely to reinforce the importance of reasons giving specific attention to that issue as part of providing reasons, the adequacy of which will not attract appellate intervention. [299] in a similar vein, statements such as those quoted above that orders for indefinite supervised time “should” contain provisions allowing “the opportunity to vary the supervision arrangements at a later time” cannot be seen as intended to fetter a trial judge’s discretion. thus, the apparent imperative, implicit in the use of the word “should”, is not to be seen as purporting to establish a binding principle of law, but, rather, as a guideline – the effect of which is to highlight the consideration of such a provision as a relevant matter in the exercise of the discretion in making an indefinite supervision order. [300] in summary, what emerges from the authorities by way of guideline when orders for supervised time are in contemplation is that:   consideration of a time or condition by which supervised time should cease is a relevant consideration in the exercise of the best interests discretion in making such an order, [b] as a consequence, the failure by a trial judge to take account of that relevant consideration may constitute discretionary error attracting the intervention of this court, [c] alternatively, if, having considered and rejected such a limitation, an order for indefinite supervision is made, the failure to consider or make an additional order whereby the indefinite order can be revisited in the future, may be indicative of discretionary error, and [d] given that, by operation of the act, “final” parenting orders can be revisited in any event (usually conditioned upon satisfaction of the “rule in rice v asplund”), the failure of a trial judge to provide reasons why any future change to the order is left to a party pursuing that right, as distinct from the orders providing a mechanism for the orders to be revisited, may constitute a failure to provide adequate reasons.  1] her honour’s order for supervised time is, in terms, indefinite. no reasons indicate why it is considered in the children’s best interests that the orders continue indefinitely as opposed to being limited in time or to the occurrence of a future event. no provision is made for the orders to be revisited. indeed, as earlier discussed, the reasons suggest that her honour considered that the supervision order should not be indefinite and should be subject to revision.  ] it has long been recognised that the permanent imposition of supervision upon the interaction between children and a parent is undesirable, though sometimes warranted (see slater & light [2013] famcafc 4, (2013) 48 fam lr 573 at 583–584, champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 at [209]–[215], moose & moose [2008] famcafc 108, (2008) flc 93-375 at [119], h & k [2001] famca 687 at [40]–[41], b and b [1993] famca 143, (1993) flc 92-357 at [79,780]). consideration should usually be given to whether orders can be created to avoid the permanence of the supervision or, if that is not practicable in the circumstances of the case, whether the orders for permanent supervision are instead best made unconditionally, leaving the supervised party to decide if and when he or she might bring fresh proceedings to vary the orders upon proof of changed circumstances, in the manner envisaged by rice and asplund [1978] famcafc 128, (1979) flc 90-725, as s 65d(2) of the act ordinarily allows (see gorman & huffman and anor [2016] famcafc 174).
conclusion  the father’s protestations of change, (2) the father’s undergoing an educational process that has the real effect of changing his outlook, as opposed to providing a tool for him to assert a change of outlook without the court being able to be satisfied that such is actually the case, or (3) x reaching an age where his own powers of judgement and discernment would make him impregnable to the father’s efforts to influence him against his mother or to educate him in antisocial attitudes and behaviours.   the father’s undergoing an educational process that has the real effect of changing his outlook, as opposed to providing a tool for him to assert a change of outlook without the court being able to be satisfied that such is actually the case, or (3) x reaching an age where his own powers of judgement and discernment would make him impregnable to the father’s efforts to influence him against his mother or to educate him in antisocial attitudes and behaviours.   x reaching an age where his own powers of judgement and discernment would make him impregnable to the father’s efforts to influence him against his mother or to educate him in antisocial attitudes and behaviours.
