relevant legal principles
...the considerations that should be given to an application which involves the custodial parent taking a child out of the jurisdiction, without being exhaustive, would be these: (a) the length of the proposed stay out of the jurisdiction, (b) the bona fides of the application, (c) the effect on the child of any deprivation of access, (d) any threats to the welfare of the child by the circumstances of the proposed environment, (e) the degree of satisfaction in which the court bases its assessment of the parties that a promise of a return to the jurisdiction would be honoured.   any threats to the welfare of the child by the circumstances of the proposed environment, (e) the degree of satisfaction in which the court bases its assessment of the parties that a promise of a return to the jurisdiction would be honoured.   the degree of satisfaction in which the court bases its assessment of the parties that a promise of a return to the jurisdiction would be honoured.
4.49 the next matter is obviously the degree of risk that the departing parent, once permitted to leave australia, will, despite assurances to the contrary, choose not to return. in assessing that degree of risk, obvious considerations are the existence (or otherwise) of continuing ties between the departing parent and australia (such as the ownership of real estate, the existence of business interests, or the residence of close family or friends here), the existence and strength of possible motives not to return (including the level of conflict between the parents, particularly over child related issues) and the existence and strength of possible motives to remain in the other nominated country (such as the ownership of real estate, the existence of business interests, or the residence of close family and/or personal friends there). 4.50 we think it will also be relevant, in exercising this discretion, to consider whether the country to which the departing parent intends to travel with the children is or is not a signatory to the convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction signed at the hague on the 25 october, 1980 (“the convention”). however, in considering and deciding what weight to give to this factor, the court would have to bear in mind that, even if the designated destination is a convention country, once the departing parent has left australia there may be little to prevent him or her deviating from that designated destination to another destination in a non-convention country or, after going to the designated destination, from then travelling on to a non-convention country. 4.51 finally, we think that a relevant consideration in the exercise of this discretion is the financial circumstances of both parties...
... in ss & ah [2010] famcafc 13 the majority (boland and thackray jj) discussed at [88] of their reasons the care necessary to be exercised in making findings in interim parenting proceedings. their honours said:
in our view, findings made at an interim hearing should be couched with great circumspection, no matter how firmly a judge’s intuition may suggest that the finding will be borne out after a full testing of the evidence.
123 later, at [100] their honours amplified their comments and said:
the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue. (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (2)(b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.
