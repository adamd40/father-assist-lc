have some type of joint session. the subsequent therapy sessions and configurations will also follow on from discussions and agreement with family members but likely range from 11 am until after dinner each day...i...focus, during the therapy, on parents and children developing their own solutions to the family problems.  phasis added)   the court’s concern that the children may be exposed to
