initially [mr becker] was talking about [x] and how the accident happened but eventually the conversation turned into him asking me about my family which made me feel uncomfortable. the conversation then progressed into the upcoming mediation and how he wanted to settle it. [mr becker] stated that i "should agree to it as well" as the "lawyers get richer and richer" and i should solve it with him at mediation. [mr becker] also disclosed how much his legal fees were. i did not respond to any mediation questions and just said repeatedly, that "it is not appropriate to speak about these topics in front of [x]" and that he should "stop please". despite my requests, [mr becker] continued to discuss our family law matters in the hospital room with [x] present.[7]
... asked father directly to leave as he has had his agreed time and more. father wanting to know specific location of certain toys he had given [x]. ward staff do not have the toys nor know the location. father wanted us to ask mother – was informed we will not engage in conversation about this between him and mother. father followed myself to ward exit, continuously asking about the toys. was informed he needed to leave. father refusing, asking to speak with hospital manager. father was asked to stay in foyer while phone call made. father refused to exit and stayed on ward. ... advised by nursing manager not to provide any further updates if father calls the ward, and to inform father that ward staff will call him if there are any changes if father represents, a code grey should be called mother visibly shaken and teary. reported that while father was present with [x], he was repeatedly texting her to come to the room. father had also gone through and unpacked all mothers belongings from suitcase and bags and put them on the parent bed. mother would like to see social work before [x] is d/c.[12]
early on the shift, dad had visited [x] on the ward this evening at 1925. initially planned for a 10 min visit, stretched out to 50mins. writer had prompted dad to leave the ward as his 10 minute scheduled was up. dad mentioned that he did not agree to a 10 minute visit. persistently asking why mum was not in the room, thus explained that only one parent is allowed by the bedside. he requested that writer contact mum to ask her to come back to the room. again reminded him that only one parent can be by the bedside. dad was then asking about toys. he mentioned that there was a missing toy, and eventually refused to leave until writer have called mum and asked her about the toy. writer reported this to the nurse in charge, and no longer felt comfortable talking to him as he seemed passive aggressive. nurse in charge [ms r] resolved situation with bed manager [ms s].[13]
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of either of his parents, and any other relevant characteristics of x
if x is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child, his right to enjoy his aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to x, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of x’s parents
1. first, where that person is, through their own actions, under any acknowledgment of allegiance, obedience or adherence to a foreign power. 2. second, where under the laws of another country, they are a subject or citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power. the high court of australia has ruled decisively and definitively on this issue of dual citizenship by clearly stating that, "a person will be disqualified under s 44(1) for holding dual citizenship, even if that person had no knowledge of it.”[14]
in the case a [country b] citizen travels to [country b] but does not hold a [country b] passportand/or is unable to present it at the border, there will be a fine of up to eur 5,000 according to section 25, paragraph 3, no. 2 passg. there are no exemptions for [country b] children. [15]
any family violence involving x or a member of his family
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of x’s family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility
i have no confidence that [[mr becker]] and i will be able to effectively communicate about any decisions regarding [x] as any suggestion or proposal i make is always firmly rejected by [[mr becker]]. in the event that [[mr becker]] and i continue to share equal parental responsibility, i fear that we will continue being in and out of mediation or court.[23]
i think what has been demonstrated both at the time i saw the parties but continuing this year, is this constant challenge even to make simple decisions about changes to practical arrangements. the bigger decisions are equally, it appears to me, difficult and emotionally challenging for the mother, and i am not sure... i don’t have confidence that the father understands that the style of his communication can be perceived as fairly challenging in nature.
