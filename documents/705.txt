general evidentiary issues
evidence of the father
evidence of the mother
ms r  r]: okay, tell me what’s happening right now and what you’re feeling. [x]: i’m scared and his watching tv i’m in my t [ms r]: and tell me, are you safe? do you feel safe right now? and if not, why. [x]: room um. i’m sort of [ms r]: try to answer the best you can. i need you to text me what has happened, exactly what you said to me on the phone call when you just called me. [x]: we were having dinner and i was picking at my food and he said what are you doing and then got pisst at me for doing that he said i’m turning the internet off you don’t deserve it as well as something is wrong with you you are having 2x the appointments (errors in original) (emphasis added)
the family therapist - dr o
...either we have here a father who has been a monster with the child legitimately feeling very scared of the father or we have here a situation in which the child has been significantly alienated from the father. i am not suggesting that the father has been perfect by any stretch of the imagination and as noted above all parents make mistakes. what is interesting however is that there is an avoidant attachment on the part of the child and from what i have available to me thus far the intensity of the avoidance and rejection is not mirrored by what i understand to have been interactions between the father and child.
my observations of [x] are that he is being harmed by what appears to be his alienation of him from his father by the mother. i would anticipate that without such alienation, that [x] would have a more ambivalent attachment to his father which is very different to the strong avoidant attachment he has to his father.   was observed with his mother. his mother was very upset and angry about what she perceives has transpired. she expressed anger about the process in front of [x]... [x]'s mother was not observed to show insight into the possible impact on [x] of her ongoing anger. ...the session between [x] and his mother was unfortunately dominated by his mother's expression of her concerns. [x]'s mother was adamant that i advocate for [x] to return to her care. she indicated to [x] that she has done everything she can for [x] in terms of what she considers to be in his best interests. [x] was observed to be absorbing the distress conveyed by his mother. [x] said he acknowledged they are both very sad. (emphasis added)
as noted during our call, while it ultimately up to the court, i intend supporting [x]’s return to your care. (errors in original)
the professional supervisor – ms s
the first family report writer – ms y
... [x]’s solution to long standing parental conflict is to emotionally distance himself from [the father] and the associated stress that this involves and to refuse to have any form of contact with him. it is also considered that [x]’s opinions of [the father] now mirror that of [the mother], with statements made by this child that he trusts in what his mother says and her responses.
... the mother’s strongly held beliefs have directly resulted in [x]’s reluctance and comments, this subsequently affecting this child’s opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with [the father] ... it is considered that [x] would benefit from an absence of exposure to adult conflict and strongly held negative and judgmental views of the other parent. continuing exposure to these issues will have a profound and damaging emotional impact upon this child, this clearly not in his best interests. (emphasis added)
the second family report writer – ms z
it cannot be determined if one parent has been solely responsible for the dynamic of their coparent relationship or if it has been a joint contribution to the dysfunction.
it is notable that [the father] was unable to articulate a clear rationale for [x] being placed in his care. this is a narrative that requires clarity and specifically one that is without blame.
in view of the comments in this case as to the weight to be given to a family report, we feel it may be helpful to make certain observations which we stress are of a general nature. (a) there is no magic in a family report. a judge is not bound to accept it and there should never be any suggestion that the counsellor is usurping the role of the court or that the judge is abdicating his responsibilities ... (b) family reports are meant to be, and almost invariably are, valuable and relevant material to assist a judge in forming his ultimate conclusions. when those views coincide with the judgment of the court, it is not because they have been accepted automatically but because the judge has found them consistent with the rest of the body of evidence before him. (c) while the counsellor's views will normally have weight with the court because of his expertise and experience, the counsellor does not usually have the same opportunity as the trial judge to weigh the evidence, observe the demeanour of the witnesses in court under examination and cross-examination, and make findings of fact based on evidence before the court which might not have been available to the counsellor. (d) hence, the counsellor's assessment of the parties may often be based upon facts which the counsellor has accepted but which turn out to be wrong, or favourable or unfavourable views formed by the counsellor from interviewing the parties without the opportunity to test in depth the credit of persons who may in court, and under cross-examination, or in the face of evidence of other witnesses, prove to be of a different character from that which the counsellor has accepted.[4]   there is no magic in a family report. a judge is not bound to accept it and there should never be any suggestion that the counsellor is usurping the role of the court or that the judge is abdicating his responsibilities ...

parenting proceedings – legal principles
the need to protect x from harm
allegations made by the mother
mother: drop off is the carpark. you are not to be on the premises in future. father: you really don’t have to send me these type of messages because you feel inadequate. [x] is growing up to be a very polite and smart, well mannered boy.
the ‘remote control’ incident
...he threw a remote control at me that almost hit me and i was frightened. (emphasis added)
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both parents
the attitude of the father towards the mother and x’s relationship with the mother
the attitude of the mother towards the father and x’s relationship with the father
the mother gave evidence in chief and she was cross-examined by the father. it was clear from her own evidence and from the questions she asked of the father that she regards [x] as being at risk in the father’s care, and considers that he does not have a good relationship with the father. she suggested that:-
a) [x] hates school holidays, b) he is emotionally distressed following visits, c) the father does not nurture or attend to [x]’s needs, d) the father provides inappropriate food, e) the father fails to give [x] medication or attend to his medical needs, f) the father has locked [x] in a room and inappropriately disciplined him, and g) [x] has returned from time with the father with a red bottom, and on one occasion, infested with head lice.
e) the father fails to give [x] medication or attend to his medical needs, f) the father has locked [x] in a room and inappropriately disciplined him, and g) [x] has returned from time with the father with a red bottom, and on one occasion, infested with head lice.
f) the father has locked [x] in a room and inappropriately disciplined him, and g) [x] has returned from time with the father with a red bottom, and on one occasion, infested with head lice.
g) [x] has returned from time with the father with a red bottom, and on one occasion, infested with head lice.
she has taken photographs of [x]’s bottom and hair on those occasions ... based on the mother’s evidence, i have significant concerns that she has involved [x] in the parental dispute and made him aware of her views that he is at risk and unsafe with the father. the mother appears to have limited insight about the impact on [x] of her doing so.[10]
the only way [x] will be able to develop and maintain a relationship with his father is if the mother is supported with psychological assistance and therapy.[11]
i am concerned that if [x] continues to live with [mr belko], apart from it having a severe impact on [x] [sic] wellbeing, there is a strong probability that it may result in the father-son relationship eroding. i say that it is essential to preserve the father-son relationship that has developed and allow it to further develop in an environment where [x] is comfortable, happy, and aware that his opinions are being considered. (errors in original)
additional considerations
any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give those views
...while those considerations will be relevant in many cases, they are by no means the only issues that a trial judge must consider when considering a child's wishes. there are many factors that may go to the weight that should be given to the wishes of children and these will vary from case to case and it is undesirable and indeed impossible to catalogue or confine them in the manner suggested. ultimately it is a process of intuitive synthesis on the part of any trial judge weighing up all the evidence relevant to the wishes of the children and applying it in a common sense way as one of the factors in the overall assessment of the children's best interests.[13]
the nature of the children’s relationships with each of their parents and other significant persons in their lives
the extent to which the children’s parents have taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in long-term decision making in relation to the children, to spend time and to communicate with the children
the extent to which each of the children’s parents have fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children
the likely effect of a change in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect of a separation from a parent or other significant persons in their lives
the practical difficulty and expense associated with the children spending time and communicating with a parent, and whether that difficulty substantially affects the children’s right to maintaining personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of the children’s parents and any other significant person to provide for their needs, including their emotional and intellectual needs
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and their parents, and any other characteristics of the children the court thinks relevant
if the children are aboriginal or torres strait islander children
attitude to the child, and to the responsibility of parenthood demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
any family violence involving the children or a member of their family, and if a family violence order applies or has applied, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to further proceedings
parental responsibility
orders to be made
a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[17]
...it is an oxymoron to expect such possibilities to then be forensically proven on the balance of probabilities according to the civil standard of proof. by definition, possibilities are not, and could never be, probabilities. risks of harm are not susceptible of scientific demonstration or proof (cdj v vaj (1998) 197 clr 172 at [151]), but are instead postulated from known historical facts and present circumstances.[19]
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment (edwards v noble (1971) 125 clr 296 at 304), though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result (norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513 at 518). the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s 60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one. we have already acknowledged how risks of harm are not susceptible of empirical proof, but a mathematical hypothetical will nevertheless illustrate how findings of “unacceptable risk” cannot be measured by the civil standard of proof. imagine a child will be minded by one of three randomly allocated carers. assume one of the carers would sexually abuse the child, but the other two would not, meaning the child stands a 33.33 per cent chance of being sexually abused if left in care. no sensible adult would take the risk of leaving the child in care because, even though the prospect of sexual abuse is only possible but not probable, the risk is still too high to tolerate. in other words, it is unacceptable. if parents (and courts) were to instead only react to risks which are probabilities then, in that example, the child would still be left in care unless shown he or she was susceptible to sexual abuse by two of the three carers and the risk was then rated at 66.66 per cent.[21]
