during this observation, there were multiple long silences. [x] and [mr encela] frequently missed cues for engagement with one another, which resulted in stilted and awkward pauses between them. both parties were noticeably uncomfortable throughout the observation. [x] eventually texted her mother and looked out the window to see when she arrived. as the session concluded, [mr encela] stood up and said, “well i’m gonna steal another hug.” [x] reciprocated briefly and then offered [ms j] a hug too. when the report writer escorted [x] outside, she exclaimed “wow, that was awkward!” [112] no observations were able to be undertaken between [y] and her father, [mr encela] due to [y]’s refusal to engage in this process. y departed the report writer’s consulting rooms prior to [mr encela’s] scheduled arrival.  2] no observations were able to be undertaken between [y] and her father, [mr encela] due to [y]’s refusal to engage in this process. y departed the report writer’s consulting rooms prior to [mr encela’s] scheduled arrival.
i also note that the children's expressed views to the report writer are consistent with the views they expressed to the independent children's lawyer who checked with them this morning, prior to today's hearing.  7] in summary, the report writer remains unconvinced that [mr encela] has satisfactorily addressed issues in relation to drug use, family violence, parenting and his understanding of [x’s] social and emotional needs. these risk issues – either individually or combined - can all impact upon a child’s psychological and physical safety. alongside increasing a child’s anxiety and posing the threat of physical danger, such issues can also culminate in parental neglect and inadequate supervision. whilst these issues may prove to be unfounded, such concerns need to be ameliorated before [x] and [y]’s relationship with his father can be expected to develop any further. [128] it is the assessment of this report writer that until these issues are addressed, that family therapy is unlikely to be of benefit to any of the parties (or children) involved in this matter. furthermore, until [mr encela] can consistently demonstrate his commitment to treating and managing these issues, then it is highly unlikely that there will be any improvement in the relationship between [mr encela] and his daughters.  8] it is the assessment of this report writer that until these issues are addressed, that family therapy is unlikely to be of benefit to any of the parties (or children) involved in this matter. furthermore, until [mr encela] can consistently demonstrate his commitment to treating and managing these issues, then it is highly unlikely that there will be any improvement in the relationship between [mr encela] and his daughters.  9] that [x] and [y] remain in in the primary care of [ms rillo]. [130] that [ms rillo] retains parental responsibility for both [x] and [y], save for their health / medical needs. [mr encela’s] responses to [ms rillo’s] communication about [x] and [y]’s health / medical needs should occur in a timely manner. [131] that the parties engage in a further mediation session, given the issues in dispute are narrow. [132] that an updated psychiatric assessment of [mr encela] would be helpful to the court in making final orders. [133] that [x] and [y] should both participate a full assessment of their cognitive capacity, as well as an assessment of [y]’s social, psychological, educational and emotional needs. this could be undertaken by aspect (autism spectrum australia). both parties should ensure that all recommendations from these assessments are implemented in a timely manner.

[137] that spend time arrangements between [x]and [y] should be supervised by an independent, professional supervisor, until [mr encela] is able to demonstrate his sobriety from alcohol and substance use. this could be evidenced by an additional hft, or via multiple consistent uds.
