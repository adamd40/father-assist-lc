the relocation of the children
whilst the statutory framework does not deal differently or specifically with cases involving a proposed relocation from other parenting cases, such cases attract the description of “relocation cases” because they bring into sharp focus the central issue of balancing statutory imperatives concerning children’s best interests in the context of the legitimate and competing interests of parents. the task is to achieve, by the application of the law, orders which are legitimate by reference to both “best interests” considerations and the rights of parents, including a right to choose where the parent lives. in some cases, the determination of “best interests” may well mean that one party’s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child’s “best interests” being served by orders which do not give one parent “optimal” arrangements or outcomes.[24]
