dear [mr carrick] the principal has asked if we could please confirm enrollment [sic] at [w school] for [x], [y] and [z]. i know your preference was to keep [x] at [t school]. however, i would like you to consider the following ...   carrick] as far as i am concerned we agreed that [y] and [z] will go to [w school] in ter 1 2022 [sic], while [x] will stay at [t school] before going to [d school] in year 7. this is the compromise i agreed to previously. i understand your concerns about [d school] fees for 3 girls. i propose we honour the commitment to send [x] and i am willing to discuss a suitable second (cheaper) alternative for [y] and [z].   carrick] i thought i’ve made my position pretty clear, is there something you’re unclear about? i would’ve liked the girls to stay at [t school] and go to [d school] in year 7, however i’ve compromised because of the changes you’ve decided to make in your own living arrangements. to be clear, these compromises adversely impact me. i suggest mediation would be a waste of time and money.
hi [mr carrick] in order to get you over the line to agree to enrolling the girls at [w school] commencing term 4 this year please see the below propositions: sunday nights – change to a mutually agreed night eg every second wednesday night, senior schools – agree that [d school] is preferable given proximity to work for us both but would equally like you to consider a cheaper alternative as a default option. as discussed, i am open to any schools you would like to consider which may be more affordable. the principal at [w school] said girls tend to go to [g school] ([suburb h]), [c school] ([suburb f]), [d school] and [ab school], as discussed, i will look at [c school] and [c school] ([suburb e]). could you please let me know if you will now let them enrol for term 4? the principal keeps asking me what is happening.
thanks [ms carrick] i will agree to the girls going to [w school] from term 4 based on you allowing me to switch that sunday night that has become very difficult for me following your move. i appreciate you agreeing to [d school] as the preferred option. of the schools listed below, [d school] is the only one i am agreeable to. you are obviously welcome to look at other schools at your volition.
thank you, will you please let [w school] know?
i will agree to the girls going to [w school] from term 4 based on you allowing me to switch that sunday night that has become very difficult for me following your move. (emphasis added)  hasis added).
i will engage with my allied health providers to build my capacity and skills in my areas of concern. i will be provided with opportunities to practice these skills in the home, learning and community environments. my local area coordinator may provide support, if required to identify and connect with services or providers who can assist me to achieve my goal ...   attended an open day at d school, (b) attended an open evening at c school, (c) was offered a place at c school for term 1 of 2023, and (d) attended an open evening at g school with the mother.   attended an open evening at c school, (c) was offered a place at c school for term 1 of 2023, and (d) attended an open evening at g school with the mother.   was offered a place at c school for term 1 of 2023, and (d) attended an open evening at g school with the mother.   attended an open evening at g school with the mother.
... unfortunately at this stage, we are oversubscribed for enrolments in [year 7 for 2023], and it is unlikely that we will be in a position to make further offers of enrolment. [...] we will keep your application on file and if we are able to make more offers in the future, we will be in touch.
hey [x] my name is [[ac]] and i will be your [d school] orientation buddy! i am in the [ad] homeroom at [d school] and [ae] colour house. you will be in [ae] too! there are eight different home rooms, [ad], [af], [ag], [ah], aj, [ak], [al] and [am]. we start the day at 8.20 in the homeroom where we go through notices and talk with our friends! the teachers are so welcoming and kind during the process of getting used to your class and helping us to have fun. when it comes to sporting events and more, we get placed into our house colours. there are six different houses, [an], [ao], ..., [ap], [aq] and my personal favourite, [ae]...  e mother] will determine whether she wishes to keep the girls enrolled and cover the school fees going forward.
see you in court. whatever the judge says, are you planning to get orders for [y] and [z] to go to some shit school. i’m willing to do court for each child individually to get each of them the best education possible.
x’s needs
parties’ impression of x’s needs  has been diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder level 2 and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. to my observation those conditions present [x] with significant social, emotional and practical challenges on a daily basis. in particular [x]: a) has sensory processing difficulties including severe pragmatic language difficulties, b) suffers from high levels of anxiety, requires significant assistance with daily tasks such as getting dressed, brushing her teeth, packing her school bag and the like with these tasks taking much longer than one would normally expect of an 11 year old. it generally takes me around 45 minutes to get [x] ready for school each morning as i am regularly required to remind her to stay on task and tell her what needs to be done next, d) needs a simple, stable and consistent routine, e) requires weekly support from a speech therapist and an occupational therapist.
a) has sensory processing difficulties including severe pragmatic language difficulties,   x gets anxious and likes routine, (b) a shorter commute to school for x would be ideal, (c) x may find it difficult to use public transport to travel to and from school difficult at first and would need assistance. however, he said that she is a very intelligent girl, and (d) x’s anxiety may be exacerbated if she has to navigate public transport to d school, but said this will be the case regardless of the arrangements given the distance between the two homes and, as such there will be a need for a plan.   a shorter commute to school for x would be ideal, (c) x may find it difficult to use public transport to travel to and from school difficult at first and would need assistance. however, he said that she is a very intelligent girl, and (d) x’s anxiety may be exacerbated if she has to navigate public transport to d school, but said this will be the case regardless of the arrangements given the distance between the two homes and, as such there will be a need for a plan.   x may find it difficult to use public transport to travel to and from school difficult at first and would need assistance. however, he said that she is a very intelligent girl, and (d) x’s anxiety may be exacerbated if she has to navigate public transport to d school, but said this will be the case regardless of the arrangements given the distance between the two homes and, as such there will be a need for a plan.   x’s anxiety may be exacerbated if she has to navigate public transport to d school, but said this will be the case regardless of the arrangements given the distance between the two homes and, as such there will be a need for a plan.
occupational therapy assessment
this assessment examined [x]'s underlying mechanical, sensory and cognitive abilities impacting on her participation in activities at home and at school. it has been reported that [x] has difficulty with handwriting, writing, social skills and personal care tasks. in the area of social skills [x] is having difficulty with confidence, self-esteem, maintaining friendships and joining in conversation and activities with peers. [x] is aware of her difficulties socialising with peers and is motivated to develop these skills. in relation to mechanical abilities, [x] was observed to have difficulty adopting and maintaining a functional pencil grip. this is impacting on her handwriting legibility and fluency. [x] has difficulties with dynamic movement in her fingertips, which impacts on all tasks that require fine motor precision e.g. handwriting and tying shoelaces. in relation to sensory processing, [x]'s mother reported that she is having difficulty processing a number of senses including vision, touch, body awareness and body and motion. sensitivity to these inputs is having a significant impact on her emotional and behavioural responses and is reducing her participation and task performance. [x] also demonstrated difficulties with visual motor integration, specifically visual perception. she appeared to rush through visual perception tasks, impacting on the accuracy of her responses. difficulties with cognitive strategy use for attention, recall, planning and motor execution are also impacting on [x]'s participation. as a result, she is demonstrating difficulty independently completing tasks which involve executive function. multi-step tasks which involve focusing on important details, ignoring distractions, knowing how long an activity should take and completing tasks within set timeframes are a challenge for [x]. such activities include independent writing, completing her morning routine and organising her belongings. [x] demonstrated and was also reported to have difficulties with motor planning. this means that she has difficulty generating, planning, organising and sequencing new movements and tasks. motor planning is the ability to plan 'what' to do and 'how' to do it. it is the ability to plan the steps of a movement and is essential for skills such as writing and sequencing actions in personal care. finally, [x] demonstrated difficulties with higher order thinking and problem solving, specifically regarding sequencing and answering negative questions. this is impacting on her ability to develop her social skills and independently complete multi-step tasks. it helps to explain why she has difficulty planning and using strategies to achieve a goal.
psychologist’s assessment of may and june 2021
hi [mr carrick], i think i mentioned to you that the ot recommended that [x] get additional assistance and re-assessment from a developmental pediatrician. [ms az] (ot} provided recommendations which has been helpful - both psychologist (for complementary therapy} and a developmental pediatrician to reassess the adhd diagnosis now that some time has lapsed. apparently, from when she was assessed 3 years ago to now there is a big jump developmentally. hence the reassessment. i organised an initial psychologist appointment which has come round quicker than expected - for tomorrow - sorry i did mean to give you the heads up earlier and so i can pay this myself if you like. her name is [ms as] and she's based in [suburb at] so i can try and facilitate those appointments and we may not need too many. i think she works on the social aspects and given [x] is having difficulty at the moment perhaps this will help her navigate that. in terms of development pediatrician reassessment perhaps we can discuss? kind regards [ms carrick] (emphasis added, otherwise per the original)
psychologist’s advice of august 2022
consideration
primary considerations
additional considerations  it is common ground that x will know some girls in year 7 at all three proposed schools. x’s paternal cousin, au, completed year 12 at d school in 2022. in 2022, x attended d school to see au’s visual art exhibition. x will have peer connections at all three schools. at d school, she will have a familial alumni connection, which is not replicated at the other two schools, and (b) x attended an “orientation day” including swimming trials, received a letter from her buddy, and based on that letter’s content, met the buddy at the “orientation day” who then accompanied x to the art show, participated in five debating workshops and also went to the open day. x’s exposure to d school has occurred over at least two years. by contrast, she has attended a “taste of year 7 day” at c school, open evening and an interview. x has had some limited contact with g school.   x attended an “orientation day” including swimming trials, received a letter from her buddy, and based on that letter’s content, met the buddy at the “orientation day” who then accompanied x to the art show, participated in five debating workshops and also went to the open day. x’s exposure to d school has occurred over at least two years. by contrast, she has attended a “taste of year 7 day” at c school, open evening and an interview. x has had some limited contact with g school.
which school can meet x’s developmental and academic needs?   she had already received the occupational therapist’s and psychologist’s assessments. the mother’s reservations about d school not being suited to x’s needs arising from autism does not accord with her nomination of d school as the “preferred option” after receiving that diagnosis, and (b) the “default option” to which “equal” consideration would be given was based solely on being a “cheaper alternative”, not an alternative that could better accommodate x’s needs.   the “default option” to which “equal” consideration would be given was based solely on being a “cheaper alternative”, not an alternative that could better accommodate x’s needs.
