reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
there is significant child protection history for [x], [y] and [z] dating back to 2013, with reported concerns primarily relating to domestic violence perpetrated by the mother [ms laidley], towards the father, [mr jaeger], [ms laidley] exposing the children to chronic and ongoing neglect, alleged inflicted injuries and bruising, the children having developed an insecure attachment with [ms laidley] and [ms laidley]’s inability to manage the children’s complex behaviour. the department initiated an investigative response in september 2020 in relation to z retuning from [mr jaeger]’s care with significant bruising. the department substantiated ‘unexplained injury’ in relation to [mr jaeger] and identified the children as being at risk in [mr jaeger]’s care. [ms laidley] was identified as being protective at this time and the department proceeded to case closure. a second investigative response was initiated in november 2020 in relation to further bruising identified on [z], however it was assessed that this brusing (sic) was likely a result of the children’s rough playing/fighting.[2]
background
chronology
all three children presented with disorganised and chaotic behaviour. the two boys have been identified as having autism spectrum disorder and this would be consistent with some of the behaviours observed throughout the assessment process. however, concern remained that overall the children's presentation was likely also indicative of a neglectful and potentially abusive parenting environment. the children's behaviours displayed at the assessment would suggest that the children required highly attentive, skilful and emotionally attuned parenting, this appearing beyond what [ms laidley] was capable of providing the children as their primary carer. furthermore, should the court accept the children's claims that their mother and partner physically abuse them as regular forms of discipline, then concern would remain that the children were at unacceptable risk of harm in their care. adding weight to these concerns was the dcp history before the court, with injuries cited on the children as recent as november 2020. the children appeared somewhat more settled in their father's care at the assessment, noting he had the support of a second person, [ms f], to attend to the children's collective needs. he also appeared more empathic towards the children, in particular [y] and [z], and patient in his response to their needs. in interview he appeared seemingly reliable and forthcoming with information, and also balanced in his views with respect to time spending. some concern did remain as to his ability to effectively care for the children, in particular all three children simultaneously, and concerns also remained before the court as to allegations of physical abuse against [z]. [y]'s reports of concern that his father hurts him appeared to be in the context of his father restraining him when hyperactive and aggressive in his play, consistent to that observed during their shared interactions at the family assessment. concern did remain that the father had smacked the children in the past, as admitted by the father himself. however, the consultant was hopeful the father was honest in his claims to no longer resort to physical discipline and to understand the consequence (for himself and the children) if he was to do so. this being said, concern did remain that the father may be limited in his ability to manage the children effectively, particularly if without additional adult support, given the children's highly demanding behaviours and complex needs. in addition, concerns remained as to the children's exposure to adult issues in their mother's care, and their mother's willingness and ability to genuinely support the father's positive attachment with the children through meaningful time spent together. concerns also remained as to the mother's tendency to rely on [x] to supplement her care of [z], leaving [x] burdened with a responsibility beyond her years and capability. at the conclusion of this assessment the consultant was not confident the children were safe in the mother's and her partner's care. as such, the consultant would recommend the court to invite the department to intervene. meanwhile, and/or should they decline, then it did appear best to support the father's proposal for time spending, not only to afford the father quality time with the children, but also provide the mother a level of respite from the children. it would also be recommended that the mother seek guidance from her paediatrician and/or autism sa to best determine [z]'s and [y]'s needs (i.e. for medication and or therapeutic support) and for court orders to be made to ensure the mother remains compliant with these recommendations. it would also be recommended that the father be provided with all relevant details of the children's medical involvements and be at liberty to liaise with these staff himself.[4]
the department have assessed that at this time, the current care arrangement stipulated within the family court documents for [y] and [x] to reside with [ms laidley] is appropriate. while the children have reported having fun while staying with [mr jaeger], the department remains concerned that he has demonstrated a significant deficit in his ability to manage children with complex and challenging behaviour resulting in serious harm. the department remains supportive of the current family contact arrangements for [y] and [x] as this ensures they are able to maintain a positive connection with [mr jaeger].[6]
departmental worker attempted to explain the seriousness of the injuries observed on [y] however [ms laidley] proceeded to threaten to give the departmental worker a bruise. [ms laidley] declined to participate in a safety plan and it was explained the department would therefore need to formally secure the children’s safety. [ms laidley] again heightened and stepped towards the departmental worker in an aggressive manner asking if removing children ‘turns you on’. the department subsequently invoked section 41 of the children and young people (safety) act 2021, placing [x] and [y] under custody of the chief executive to enable the department to place the children with [mr jaeger]. it is noted that neither [x] nor [y] expressed any concerns when advised they would be entering [mr jaeger]’s care and transitioned into his home environment with no issues. on 28 october 2022, the department held further consultation with cps and sapol regarding the outcome of the medical assessment for [y]. cps advised that following the medical they were unable to definitively determine whether the bruises were inflicted injuries particularly given no consistent narrative has been provided in relation to how the bruising occurred. cps noted the bruising is unusual in the sense that it is suspicious and is not commonly seen in accidents or injuries. cps assessed the bruising was unlikely to have been caused by a fall given the skin had no abrasions.[7]
ongoing concerns exist in relation to [ms laidley]’s inability to engage with the department and this presenting as a significant barrier to addressing the child protection concerns. of significant concern is that following the previous family court hearing, [ms laidley] maintained her refusal to engage with the department knowing this meant she would be unable to have contact with [x] and [y]. [ms laidley] appears to not appreciate the impact this period of no contact is having on the children and that this could be experienced by the children as rejection. the department considers that the children’s safety is best secured in [mr jaeger]’s care and that short time spending with [ms laidley], in a supervised setting would likely not pose a risk to the children’s imminent physical and emotional safety.[8]

the nature of interim hearing
decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing.
the assessment of risk is one of the many burdens placed on family law decision makers. risk assessment comprises two elements – the first requires prediction of the likelihood of the occurrence of harmful events, and the second requires consideration of the severity of the impact caused by those events. in our view, the assessment of risk in cases involving the welfare of children cannot be postponed until the last piece of evidence is given and tested, and the last submission is made. we accept, however, that it is always a question of degree depending on the evidence that is before the court.
apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term ‘unacceptable risk’. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.
legal principles relating to parenting proceedings
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[21]
