evidence
the family report
the law 0] ... apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
section 60cc considerations
meaningful relationship 8] ...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child’s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents...
risk of harm
the mother’s case
the father’s case   kappel] will be going to jail soon. there is a criminal investigation being raised against you..... the reason [x] couldn’t stay at [mr kappel]’s parents is because her grandfather is a paedophile..... i hope they do to you in jail what you did to me. you’re going to jail, i’ve got all the medical records.”
the additional considerations: section 60cc (3)
discussion and determination
parental responsibility
time with orders   said her dad said she had to shower before she was allowed to call me, this seemed unusual as there was only a small amount of blood and [x] routinely showers only at night.[7]
and   told the doctor that [mr kappel] played games with her on the bed and then put music on and she fell asleep with her dad in the same bed as her on saturday night. [x] told the doctor that her dad tells her that he sleeps on the couch but [x] said she is not sure as he falls asleep with her dad in the bed and sometimes he is there in the morning.[8]
..while the parenting arrangement is currently working and appropriate, i am concerned that if [x] continues to spend only one night each week with the father, her relationship with him will not advance to the same degree as her relationship with the mother, or the degree the father would now like it to (regardless of his history of involvement) and further, the father will continue to feel disenfranchised, controlled and unable to participate more meaningfully as [x]'s parent rather than a mere “babysitter.”[12]
