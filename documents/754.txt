reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
the proceedings to date
the nature of an interim hearing
decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing.
how the court determines a child’s best interests
a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children’s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children’s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent’s ability to care for the children.
sapol & dcp documents
departmental records indicate that [mr dodd] has an evidenced pattern of perpetrating chronic, persistent and ongoing domestic violence toward [ms ferrell] in the presence of x including strangulation and threats to kill. the department consider that the paternal grandmother to [x], ([ms c]) has potentially perpertrated family violence toward [ms ferrell] through coercive control due to her role as property manager of [ms ferrell]'s previous housing.[8]
the mother’s evidence
the father’s evidence
other relevant legal considerations iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person’s family, or causes the family member to be fearful.  aving a “meaningful relationship” with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child’s best interests.[14]
the assessment of risk is one of the many burdens placed on family law decision makers. risk assessment comprises two elements – the first requires prediction of the likelihood of the occurrence of harmful events, and the second requires consideration of the severity of the impact caused by those events. in our view, the assessment of risk in cases involving the welfare of children cannot be postponed until the last piece of evidence is given and tested, and the last submission is made. we accept, however, that it is always a question of degree depending on the evidence that is before the court.
apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.
there are severe consequences for children who are placed into the care or under the supervision of parents who have been violent. the consequences are no less serious when the violence is not physical.[19]
