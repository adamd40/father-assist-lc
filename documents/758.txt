reasons for judgment
judge glass
statutory framework
primary considerations
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both of her parents
i guess there are a number of scenarios here where perhaps working with the mother to perhaps further understand aspects of herself which prevents her doing so may be appropriate. however, having given a fair bit of evidence in the court and then noting that such endeavours are without accompanying strong orders often means that nothing really happens. and it’s usual, i think, for the court and perhaps the experts to look at other scenarios, which might involve change of residence and so on in those circumstances.
well, i – i think that that scenario is one which will allow [x] to have a relationship with her father and contact with her mother, and there is potential, therefore, in those circumstances, for the mother to actually face the reality of her – the consequences of her actions, in terms of the damage that she’s causing [x] and in terms of reducing and depriving her contact with her dad.
i think it would be worse for [x] to be in, out, in, out. i can’t see that being a viable option, because of where – [ms harry]’s views, her perspectives, her actions over the last 12 months, since it has been in the court. i really – i wish that was an option, but i – i just can’t see how that would be a viable option.
the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
family violence
alleged child abuse by mr harry
alleged child abuse by ms harry
i mean, it’s so common, isn’t it, that children live in two worlds and they adopt the view of the parent with whom they’re with and happily, they go between one and the other and they maintain the two worlds separately within themselves... and that despite all the woeful stories about horrible things and all the rest, the child experiences the father, if you like, as he is rather than in accordance with the narrative that has developed in the mother’s home. so she has split off the two, and we see this all the time, and in order to maintain a relationship with both parents in such circumstances, the child takes on the view of the parent they’re living with and changes when they move back with the other parent, so it doesn’t mean that there’s a happy set of circumstances for the child. we know that as children get older and their circumstances, in attempting to manage these two differing worlds, is actually quite harmful to them.
