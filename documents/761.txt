value as at 30 june 2020 ble removed due to identifying features unable to be anonymised]
... i am instructed that the group requires a cash balance of approximately $[2.1] million to maintain ongoing operations of the business, which reflects three months of operating expenses10. in respect of this, i note that the balance of $[1.4] million of cash held by the group as at 30 june 2020 is less than the minimum level of cash required for working capital, resulting in a shortfall of approximately $[0.7] million   around 80% of the revenue generated by the group is from ad hoc contracts that are primarily the result of [works] that occur. given the nature of work performed, the group must maintain a minimum staff base and level of overheads in order to tender for contracts, and incurs significant recruitment costs when projects ramp up. as a result, the level of ebitda and ebitda margin achieved by the group have been relatively volatile from year to year, (b) the group has faced increased competition each year since it commenced operations, with a new competitor entering the market on average every one to two years15. there has also been a number of global competitors entering the market recently, which are generally more able (and willing) to compete on price, resulting in further downward pressure on the group’s margins, and (c) the group’s fy20 earnings were impacted by the outbreak of covid-19, which resulted in significant disruption to the australian and nz operations. within australia several projects were delayed and state border closures impacted the ability to deploy staff across state borders. in nz, the lockdown laws required all projects to come to an immediate halt which resulted in the group’s entire nz workforce being stood down. projects in nz began progressively returning to operation from may 2020, with several australian projects delayed until the end of calendar year 2020 due to the prevailing border closures as at the valuation date.   the group has faced increased competition each year since it commenced operations, with a new competitor entering the market on average every one to two years15. there has also been a number of global competitors entering the market recently, which are generally more able (and willing) to compete on price, resulting in further downward pressure on the group’s margins, and (c) the group’s fy20 earnings were impacted by the outbreak of covid-19, which resulted in significant disruption to the australian and nz operations. within australia several projects were delayed and state border closures impacted the ability to deploy staff across state borders. in nz, the lockdown laws required all projects to come to an immediate halt which resulted in the group’s entire nz workforce being stood down. projects in nz began progressively returning to operation from may 2020, with several australian projects delayed until the end of calendar year 2020 due to the prevailing border closures as at the valuation date.   the group’s fy20 earnings were impacted by the outbreak of covid-19, which resulted in significant disruption to the australian and nz operations. within australia several projects were delayed and state border closures impacted the ability to deploy staff across state borders. in nz, the lockdown laws required all projects to come to an immediate halt which resulted in the group’s entire nz workforce being stood down. projects in nz began progressively returning to operation from may 2020, with several australian projects delayed until the end of calendar year 2020 due to the prevailing border closures as at the valuation date.
in summary: of the related party receivables/payables (current and non-current) relates to loans owing to or from new zealand entities which are non-trading and the net receivable amount is not recoverable by the business. our client suggests that the appropriate course of action would be to remove the net amount when calculating the asset base of the group.
consequently, i have adopted $nil value for net related party receivables. whilst the dividend payable liability is considered surplus to ongoing operations of the group, i note that the amounts are due to the [q trust] and the [garvey family trust] , both of which are related parties (refer paragraphs [24 to 26] above). as the dividends remain unpaid, i have not included an adjustment to the equity value of the [b group] for the liability as i consider its net impact on the trust’s interests in [b group] to be $nil
shareholder loans
current tax position
i understand that between may 2020 and june 2021,the group’s tax debts totalled some $3 million. between 18 november 2021 and 30 june 2022, another $2.586 million in tax debts was accrued including interest.

lump sum
in relation to the first stage, in our view, when considering whether to exercise the power under s 79 and s 80(1)(h) of the act to make an interim property order the “overarching consideration” is the interests of justice. it is not necessary to establish compelling circumstances. all that is required is that in the circumstances it is appropriate to exercise the power. in exercising the wide and unfettered discretion conferred by the power to make such an order, regard should be had to the fact that the usual order pursuant to s 79 is a once and for all order made after a final hearing.
as to the third matter identified at 79,930 by the full court in harris, in discussion before us it was described as the “adjustment issue” or “claw-back issue”. it was submitted by senior counsel for the applicant that it is relevant to consider whether an order would give the applicant “more than they would be indubitably entitled to on a final hearing” or alternatively “would it give them so much that it could not be adjusted on a final hearing?” as we have observed the full court in zschokke at 83,220-221 stressed the importance of consideration of the “adjustment issue” if the power in s 80(1)(h) of the act is being exercised. we accept the submission and observe that this matter is relevant because the discretion conferred by the power in s 79 is to make such order as the court considers appropriate provided it is just and equitable to make the order in circumstances where the power will not be exhausted by the interim order. as bryant cj and coleman j observed in gabel v yardley at [69] and [72] the interim order must be capable of variation or reversal without resort to s 79a of the act or appeal. as finn j said at [126] the interim order must be “capable of alteration at any time prior to, or as part of, the final exercise of the s 79 power”.   the applicant invites the court to ignore the ato debt of about $6 million. i will not do so. the applicant does not impugn the debt, but wishes to know more about it. those are two different things. the existence of the debt is not reasonably capable of being doubted in the presence of an ato activity statement that records its quantum. (b) i must take into account the interests of creditors for the purpose of s 90sf(3)(i) of the act, (c) i could not be satisfied that the order is just and equitable unless the alleged debt to the ato is considered for the purpose of s 90sm(2) of the act, (d) counsel of the applicant submitted that even if the ato debt is taken into account, the value of b group would be about $3 million or $4 million, this being a deduction of the tax debt from the enterprise value. i do not necessarily accept this. the ato debt of $6 million is as at december 2022. the enterprise value is a draft figure as at 30 june 2020. to superimpose a liability at one point in time to the valuer’s workings for a different point in time assumes that b group has been in a state of suspended economic animation since 30 june 2020 in all respects other than its tax position, and (e) there is no evidence as to whether the ato will permit b group to enter into a payment plan for the tax debt, or what terms of such a plan may be.   i must take into account the interests of creditors for the purpose of s 90sf(3)(i) of the act, (c) i could not be satisfied that the order is just and equitable unless the alleged debt to the ato is considered for the purpose of s 90sm(2) of the act, (d) counsel of the applicant submitted that even if the ato debt is taken into account, the value of b group would be about $3 million or $4 million, this being a deduction of the tax debt from the enterprise value. i do not necessarily accept this. the ato debt of $6 million is as at december 2022. the enterprise value is a draft figure as at 30 june 2020. to superimpose a liability at one point in time to the valuer’s workings for a different point in time assumes that b group has been in a state of suspended economic animation since 30 june 2020 in all respects other than its tax position, and (e) there is no evidence as to whether the ato will permit b group to enter into a payment plan for the tax debt, or what terms of such a plan may be.   i could not be satisfied that the order is just and equitable unless the alleged debt to the ato is considered for the purpose of s 90sm(2) of the act, (d) counsel of the applicant submitted that even if the ato debt is taken into account, the value of b group would be about $3 million or $4 million, this being a deduction of the tax debt from the enterprise value. i do not necessarily accept this. the ato debt of $6 million is as at december 2022. the enterprise value is a draft figure as at 30 june 2020. to superimpose a liability at one point in time to the valuer’s workings for a different point in time assumes that b group has been in a state of suspended economic animation since 30 june 2020 in all respects other than its tax position, and (e) there is no evidence as to whether the ato will permit b group to enter into a payment plan for the tax debt, or what terms of such a plan may be.   counsel of the applicant submitted that even if the ato debt is taken into account, the value of b group would be about $3 million or $4 million, this being a deduction of the tax debt from the enterprise value. i do not necessarily accept this. the ato debt of $6 million is as at december 2022. the enterprise value is a draft figure as at 30 june 2020. to superimpose a liability at one point in time to the valuer’s workings for a different point in time assumes that b group has been in a state of suspended economic animation since 30 june 2020 in all respects other than its tax position, and (e) there is no evidence as to whether the ato will permit b group to enter into a payment plan for the tax debt, or what terms of such a plan may be.   there is no evidence as to whether the ato will permit b group to enter into a payment plan for the tax debt, or what terms of such a plan may be.
