legal principles
the objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by:   ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.   the principles underlying these objects are that (except when it is or would be contrary to a child's best interests):   children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture).
in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, the court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.   how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents' current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents' current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant. note: paragraph (c) reference to future capacity—the court has power under section 13c to make orders for parties to attend family counselling or family dispute resolution or participate in courses, programs or services.

consideration of what orders are in the best interests of the children in this matter60cc considerationsprimary considerations
section 60cc(2)(a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents
i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitative one.
the question of what constitutes in the circumstances a meaningful relationship is one not defined by the act. the definition of substantial time with a parent is one that relates to significant times, rather than to the amount of time, and does not provide any particular assistance in determining what a meaningful relationship is.
“there is no issue here that a meaningful relationship with a mother and the father will benefit the child. the child will of course live with the mother and spend time with the father, and although the dispute centres around the extent of the time that the child should spend with the father, that alone does not determine whether there will be a meaningful relationship or not. other important factors include how the time is spent and the input of the parent during that time.”
