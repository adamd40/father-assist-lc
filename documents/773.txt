notation:
reasons for judgment(ex tempore)
judge vasta
in my view, the notion of primary attachment has particular significance for the children at this time, particularly for [x]. theoretically this is an important consideration during a child’s first three years. primary attachment typically develops when a child is six months old, approximately. i note that [x] was five months old when the parents separated. even though the mother may have provided the majority of care to the youngster before separation, it is unlikely that a primary attachment developed. i would assume the youngster is now primarily attached to the father. theoretically a child may become distressed when away from the primary attachment figure for any significant length of time. however, from age 3 approximately most children will develop an increased capacity to establish and maintain multiple attachments. for young children it is usually preferable that visits with a non-custodial parent be reasonably short and relatively frequent. sole parenting can be very challenging and the sole care of the younger children even more so. i accept that the father likely benefits from practical supports in his parenting, whereas such may not be the case for the mother. on balance, i consider it appropriate for [y] and [x] to remain in the care of the father. i also have a view that the mother has an important role in the children’s lives and should be spending time with them regularly.   the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents and (b) the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm or from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm or from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence.   it is important to y and x that they have a meaningful relationship with both their mother and father and (b) there is no need to protect them from being exposed to the risk of family violence, harm or abuse.   there is no need to protect them from being exposed to the risk of family violence, harm or abuse.   the children are far too young to be able to express any views as to what should be occurring. and they, quite properly, have not been asked in the course of any report writing or anything of that nature to venture on such opinion. (b) i have looked at the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the parents. whilst it is that the children have had limited contact with the mother since july 2020, i have considered that the time that they have spent has been quite meaningful. the relationship of the children with their father is easily ascertained and that does not cause any issues for me. (c) i have also looked at the nature of the relationship of the child with the other members of the greater family. what is clear is that the father has had quite some support in city c from his aunt, from his cousins and from other relatives. he now has support from his new partner, who is the aunt of the children. i have had regard to the fact that the mother has had support from her extended family, though i do note that they are now at least an hour’s drive from where she lives, whereas the supports for the father are very close. it has been pointed out that one of those supports, the aunt, is battling cancer, but this has not diminished the fact that she can, when called upon, still look after the children and support the father. i have looked at the extent to which each of the child’s parents have taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child. it is true that the father has been the one who has been making the decisions. it is true that he has, whether deliberately – and i do not accept that he has deliberately, but rather inadvertently or ignorantly, not allowed the mother to participate in those decisions. it seems to me that part of that reason is that, as he explained, he knows that the mother will argue with him and he simply wants to avoid the argument. it was instructive that he spoke about the way in which the mother would answer him. the mother put in a number of text messages that the father had sent. the mother, through her barrister, also criticised the father for not involving the mother in decisions and particularly spoke of only in november texting the mother about schooling. again, it was somewhat instructive that the mother did not put her own response into evidence. the father read out the mother’s response when questioned in the witness box yesterday when he said that he had sent her a text talking about schooling and explaining the schools in the catchment area and whether, if she did not agree, could they speak about other schools and what would happen from there. her reply on 3 november was, “schools in my area has not been an option for me to look into as my proven effort to keep me as a parent on the paperwork has been appalling. i’ve looked into one here. however, being that y hasn’t been to a four-year old check or not that you have made known to me. again, great effort, then i need to know all of his medical information, psychologist information and all.” with that as a response, one can understand why the father was somewhat reticent to keep communicating with the mother. i have taken into consideration the fact that the mother has spent whatever time with the child as she can and has communicated with the children whenever it is that she can. (ca) there is no information that either of the parents have failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the child. (d) i have looked at the likely effect of changes in the circumstances of the child. what is clear here is that the children have built a life in city c. the mother had been living in town r. she has moved to town b because she has found a job there. she has no other supports in town b. all her supports are back in town r. she has not told this court why it is that she cannot, or will not, move to city c. the father wishes to stay in city c because this is where he has set up his life. this is where his supports are and the children now have roots in the community. but it is that the mother, as is her prerogative, wishes to stay in town b and the father wishes to stay in city c. this means that if the status quo is maintained that the mother will only be able to see the children in a way that is both appropriate for the children’s age and somewhat limited given the distance between them, although i do note that such distance, since she has moved to town b, has lessened. if it were that the child were to move to town b and live with the mother, i have spoken already of what it is that mr q has said. the children have a primary attachment to the father which would be distressing for them to have severed. the children have the support from greater family, including now their own maternal aunt, who is also their stepmother, and the children are settled, have been at educational institutions and are ready to venture into the community. those changes in the children, if it were that they were to move out of the area, has been very much a focus of mine. i do note what effect that would have on either parents and i also note what effect that would have on the newborn half-sibling/cousin of the children. (e) i have taken into account the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with the parents and whether that would substantially affect the children’s ability or right to maintain a personal relationship and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis. it seems to me that the orders proposed by all parties, whether that means that the children lives with the mother or lives with the father, are sufficient that those problems can be overcome whilst still not being optimal for the children. (f) i have already spoken of the capacity of each of the children’s parents to provide for the needs of the children, including the emotional and intellectual needs. (g) i have taken into account the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background of the two children. (h) i have noted that the mother identifies as an aboriginal person and therefore y and x will identify in the same way, as will the newborn half-sibling/cousin. i do note that the father acknowledges this. and whilst he has done very little so far, neither is there anything from the mother as to how it is that she would assist the child’s right to enjoy their aboriginal culture and with other people who share that culture. it may be that the children have been too young to expose them, but the fact that both parents have acknowledged this aspect of the children leads me to believe that this is an aspect of their lives that will not be neglected. (i) i have already spoken about the attitude to the children and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the children’s parents. (j) i have spoken about the family violence aspect. (k) there is conflicting evidence as to whether a family violence order is still in place. the mother gave evidence to me that the order has expired, yet the transcript (that is exhibit 4) has in it that a two-year order was made on 12 march 2021 and so will not expire for another nearly two months. be that as it may, i have taken into account the nature of the order and the circumstances in which the order was made, such that it has been considered by me. (l) i have also tried to make orders that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings. (m) i have taken into account all other matters that i feel are relevant.   i have looked at the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the parents. whilst it is that the children have had limited contact with the mother since july 2020, i have considered that the time that they have spent has been quite meaningful. the relationship of the children with their father is easily ascertained and that does not cause any issues for me.

(i) i have already spoken about the attitude to the children and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the children’s parents. (j) i have spoken about the family violence aspect.
