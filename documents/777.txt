the actions in question are variously referred to in discussions as 'conduct', 'misconduct', or 'fault'. those terms seem to be used interchangeably. as a matter of convenience, we will use the term 'conduct'. ... put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party's contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties' respective contributions within s 79. we prefer this approach to the concept of 'negative contributions' which is sometimes referred to in this discussion.
