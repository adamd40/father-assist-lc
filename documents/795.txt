reasons for judgment
judge taglieri phasis added]
additional reasons
... in the exercise of my discretion, i consider that very small percentage adjustment should be made in favour of the mother for the contentions i have taken to be add-back arguments.
in my view the parties interests in the net assets identified above should be adjusted to achieve an outcome whereby the [husband] receives 54 per cent and the mother 46 per cent as i have concluded: a) that [wife]’s overall contributions are somewhat more than the [husband]’s (at [171] above), b) if the [wife] relocates to [city c] , as the [husband] will have the primary parenting responsibilities and the children will live with him, a net adjustment of less than 10 per cent is required (at [172]), and c) a small adjustment in favour of the [wife] is needed for the add-back finding made.
a) that [wife]’s overall contributions are somewhat more than the [husband]’s (at [171] above), b) if the [wife] relocates to [city c] , as the [husband] will have the primary parenting responsibilities and the children will live with him, a net adjustment of less than 10 per cent is required (at [172]), and c) a small adjustment in favour of the [wife] is needed for the add-back finding made.
b) if the [wife] relocates to [city c] , as the [husband] will have the primary parenting responsibilities and the children will live with him, a net adjustment of less than 10 per cent is required (at [172]), and c) a small adjustment in favour of the [wife] is needed for the add-back finding made.
c) a small adjustment in favour of the [wife] is needed for the add-back finding made.
in summary these being for slightly more future parenting responsibilities, lower income for the foreseeable future and potential health complications relating to her [medical] condition.
