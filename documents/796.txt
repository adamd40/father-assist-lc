mother’s case
father’s case
uncontentious facts and issues.  the children have a meaningful relationship with each parent, which is of benefit to them, (b) there is no current relevant issue concerning the need to protect the children from abuse, neglect or violence. although the mother had referred to past statements made by y to the court child expert about being fearful of the father and the father made allegations that the mother fails to impose boundaries. these contentions were not given focus or significance to the current circumstances. further, the contentions and related evidence in the parties’ affidavits should be viewed in context that they have agreed to an order for equal shared parental responsibility and seek equal time with the children. accordingly, i do not attribute any material weight to the evidence and contentions, (c) the children have expressed views to the court child expert and family members that they would prefer equal or near equal time between the parents, and that x would prefer fewer changeovers than under the present arrangements, (d) the children have close and loving relationships with each parent, their extended family members and ms f, who are all well able to provide for their needs, (e) each parent has been an integral part of the children’s lives, each participating actively and able to do so, including making decisions regarding their well-being, (f) both parents work and contribute to the maintenance of the children and there was no suggestion that their needs are not being met. to the extent that the mother’s case outline contends that the father’s contribution has been “constant source of tension,” this did not appear to be heavily relied upon in submissions by counsel for the mother, except to identify it as a source of conflict or ineffective communication at times. (g) the father is paying child support pursuant to administrative assessments. although he has challenged those assessments, he is exercising his legal right to do so and i ought not to infer adversely merely because of this, (h) the parties live in close proximity to one another, with the father in m town and the mother in n town. there is no practical barrier to facilitating the children’s’ time with each parent, and (i) both parties say the other is generally capable of providing for the children’s physical, emotional and intellectual needs. despite this each makes some criticism of the others parenting in their affidavits and remarks made to the court child expert. i find the criticism is a reflection of their subjective opinions based on very different parenting styles and values. despite the conflict this causes at times, i accept the expert views of the court child expert. namely, that their respective conduct “falls inside the range of acceptable limits of parental empathy and guidance”.   there is no current relevant issue concerning the need to protect the children from abuse, neglect or violence. although the mother had referred to past statements made by y to the court child expert about being fearful of the father and the father made allegations that the mother fails to impose boundaries. these contentions were not given focus or significance to the current circumstances. further, the contentions and related evidence in the parties’ affidavits should be viewed in context that they have agreed to an order for equal shared parental responsibility and seek equal time with the children. accordingly, i do not attribute any material weight to the evidence and contentions, (c) the children have expressed views to the court child expert and family members that they would prefer equal or near equal time between the parents, and that x would prefer fewer changeovers than under the present arrangements, (d) the children have close and loving relationships with each parent, their extended family members and ms f, who are all well able to provide for their needs, (e) each parent has been an integral part of the children’s lives, each participating actively and able to do so, including making decisions regarding their well-being, (f) both parents work and contribute to the maintenance of the children and there was no suggestion that their needs are not being met. to the extent that the mother’s case outline contends that the father’s contribution has been “constant source of tension,” this did not appear to be heavily relied upon in submissions by counsel for the mother, except to identify it as a source of conflict or ineffective communication at times.
