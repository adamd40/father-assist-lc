evidence
standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
issues for determination
issue 1 - should the parties' superannuation and non-superannuation assets be included in one pool?
after the introduction of the relevant amendments to the superannuation regulations in 2001, the first significant case before the full court was coghlan (above). the primary issue for determination in that appeal was whether the trial judge had erred by not including the parties’ superannuation interests in the property pool for division between the parties. the trial judge had assessed and divided the net property of the parties, excluding the superannuation from the pool, and did not make any s 75(2) factor adjustments for superannuation considerations. the majority (bryant cj, finn and coleman jj) considered the content, intent and effect of part viiib of the superannuation regulations. ... their honours then commented on the effect of the legislation in practice, finding that there was a discretion as to the way in which superannuation interests may be treated in a particular case, subject to certain steps required to be taken where splitting orders are sought, and prudent to be taken where no splitting order is sought:
practical implications nothing we have said in this judgment would prevent a court in the exercise of its discretion from including a superannuation interest as an item of property in the list of property which is drawn as “the first step” in the determination of proceedings under s 79, whether or not a splitting order is sought in those proceedings. this approach could be adopted where the parties agree that it should be adopted, or where the court is satisfied that the superannuation interest is indeed property within the meaning of the definition of property contained in s 4(1), or if the interest is not within that definition, but is of relatively small value in the context of the value of the other assets in the case, or there are features about the interest which leads the court to conclude that this would be an appropriate approach. the parties' contributions to all items on that list (including the superannuation interest) would then be assessed on either a global or an asset by asset basis. it might then be necessary in the s 75(2) context to have regard to the parties' future superannuation entitlements (having regard of course to any division proposed on the basis of their contributions), with consideration then being given to the overall justice and equity of any proposed award or o (including any proposed splitting order). indeed, this is the approach which the full court has used on its re-exercise of the trial judge's discretion in ilett and ilett [2005] famca 432, (2005) flc 93-221 (which will be delivered contemporaneously with the decision in this case). ... in summary, then, the trial judge has a discretion as to how superannuation interests will be treated in a particular case. if superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to: (a) value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties' property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable. in the context of a consideration of the matters referred to in sub-paragraphs (b) and (c) of the last paragraph, the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation, actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse's present and/or future entitlements under the fund.   value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties' property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.   consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties' property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.   consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties' property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.   ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties' property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable.
the majority emphasised that in circumstances where superannuation interests are dealt with separately from other property, then their “real nature”, as explained by their honours, can be taken into account at both the adjustment stage and at the just and equitable orders consideration stage. if this approach is adopted, whereby superannuation interests are dealt with separately from property as defined in s 4(1), but are subject to the considerations in s 79(4), then not only will any contributions, both direct and indirect, by either party to such superannuation interests be more likely to be given proper recognition, but the real nature of the superannuation interests in question can also be taken into account, both in consideration of the s 75(2) matters and in the final assessment of whether the ultimate order is just and equitable. when we refer to “the real nature” of the relevant superannuation interest, we are referring to the fact that notwithstanding that its value according to the regulations may well be calculated to be a very significant amount, that superannuation interest may be no more than a present or future periodic sum, or perhaps a future lump sum, the value of which at date of receipt is unknown.  hasis added)” [46]
issue 2 – add-backs
marriage is for most couples an economic partnership. married couples live together and work together with the ultimate object of purchasing a home, paying it off, acquiring other assets with the overall object of attaining a higher standard of living. the reported decisions in respect of applications for settlement of property under sec. 79 of the act are unanimous hat both parties should share the economic fruits of a marriage, having regard to the provisions of sec. 79(4) and sec. 75(2), although not necessarily equally.[48]
it does seem to me, however, that if a party has either by deliberate act or by economic recklessness reduced the value of assets available for distribution then the economic consequences which flow therefrom including the resultant burden to the other party are directly relevant to a consideration of the respective contributions of the parties contemplated by sec. 79(4). if, on the other hand, the decision of the full court in antmann and antmann (supra) is to be interpreted both literally and restrictively as precluding the court from a consideration of negative contribution in relation to para. (a) or (b) of sec. 79(4) then i am nevertheless of the opinion that evidence of wantonness or recklessness having economic consequences is clearly a matter which the court may take into account pursuant to the provisions of sec. 75(2)(o).[52]   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[54]   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[54]
to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are: (a) where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) flc 92-816 the full court said at 85,262: for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654:   where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) flc 92-816 the full court said at 85,262: for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654:   where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654:
in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly. (c) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[56]   in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644:   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[56]   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[56]
it seems that human experience (and common sense) shows that while parties are together, each might, from time to time and with the consent of the other, either express or implied, apply or appropriate assets or funds to his or her own purposes. when the relationship is good, no-one is likely to care — let alone keep records. individual amounts may stand out, as is the case here, but many small transactions in combination may exceed, in total value, one large transaction. it is not the court's function to conduct an audit of the marriage or of the relationship finances. the parties' remedies for resolving disputes about expenditure while they are together are centred on them and them alone. choosing one transaction from many prior to separation for different treatments, specifically "to be added-back" or notionally included in the pool of property may make doing justice and equity between the parties difficult.”[57]
whilst not seeking to place a fetter upon the exercise of a trial judge in individual cases, it seems to us that the concept of adding monies reasonably disposed of back into the pool ought to be the exception rather than the rule. the parties are entitled to reasonably conduct their affairs post-separation in a manner that is consistent with properly getting on with their lives. providing modest support for their adult children or taking not inappropriate holidays for themselves seems to fit comfortably within that description.[60]
in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post-separation income or acquisitions.[62]
in my view there is merit in ground 4(b). i would not necessarily wish to be seen as endorsing the effect of receipt of these funds as “add backs” to the balance sheet, something which her honour eschewed. however the receipt of these funds by the husband requires expression in some form, either as a matter to be taken into account under s 75(2)(o), or, as the wife later argues, in relation to contributions. but however expressed, failure to properly account for it leads to the conclusion that the result reached by her honour was “plainly wrong” (see norbis & norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513 per brennan j at 539).
when the parties to a relationship earn income and derive capital through corporate/trust structures established primarily to lawfully minimise taxation, the indirect contribution of a party who is not involved in the day-to-day operation of those structures is sometimes overlooked. yet, the “non-active” party can, in truth, be a significant contributor. this court said more than 30 years ago in lee steere and lee steere, “it cannot be denied that the splitting of income tax is a direct and immediate financial benefit to the husband and to that extent a direct financial contribution on the part of the wife”. so, too, “the issue of the wife’s personal liability as a director of the companies ... is a matter of increasing relevance in recent times ... the ‘days of the sleeping, or passive, director are well and truly over.
issue 3 - waste
it may be accepted that the above statement by baker j in kowaliw (supra) and subsequent cases which have considered and applied it (see, for example, in the marriage of omacini (2005) 33 fam lr 134, (2005) flc 93-218, [2005] famca 195, in the marriage of djm and jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) 23 fam lr 396, (1998) flc 92-816, in the marriage of a d and a c townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505, (1995) flc 92-569, browne v green [1999] famca 1483, (1999) flc 92-873, chorn & hopkins [2004] famca 633, (2004) flc 93-204, cerini & cerini [1998] famca 143 (cerini & cerini), smb & mfb [2006] famca 46, polonius & york [2010] famcafc 228) establish guidelines for the exercise of the s 79 discretion as distinct from requiring the application of a fixed legal rule to the facts on which the operation of the rule depends. (lovine & connor (2012) flc 93-515, [2012] famcafc 168 at [101]–[103]). however it appears clear from those authorities that in the context of a claim of reckless, negligent or wanton conduct, as advanced here, at least two elements must be fulfilled for the guidelines to have application. first, that the conduct can be so characterised and, second that there exists a direct causal connection between the conduct so characterised and the loss or reduction of value so caused.
issue 4 – how should the wife’s failure to pay the mortgage and rates be considered when assessing parties contributions?[78]
issue 5 - the impact on the property adjustment (if any) of the wife’s care of the husbands children during the marriage
issue 6 – whether the court should regard the wife’s contributions as having been made more arduous due to her experiences of family violence from the husband
the actions in question are variously referred to in discussions as ‘conduct’, ‘misconduct’, or ‘fault’. those terms seem to be used interchangeably. as a matter of convenience, we will use the term ‘conduct’. the question of what is encompassed by the term ‘domestic violence’ in this sense has so far received little attention (but see the definition in s 60d for pt vii purposes). although in this discussion reference is made exclusively to domestic violence, it is not intended to be confined to that issue. we do not consider that domestic violence is an exclusive category. it is the most obvious example of a wider and more general category of conduct which may be relevant within s 79. this issue only really arises in a discretionary system of property settlement law. in non-discretionary systems the relevant issues and steps are generally spelt out in a way which is intended to be exclusive.[96] ... put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79. we prefer this approach to the concept of ‘negative contributions’ which is sometimes referred to in this discussion. in the above formulation, we have referred only to domestic violence, for the reasons which we indicated earlier, but its application is not limited to that.[97] ... it is essential to bear in mind the relatively narrow band of cases to which these considerations apply. to be relevant, it would be necessary to show that the conduct occurred during the course of the marriage and had a discernible impact upon the contributions of the other party. it is not directed to conduct which does not have that effect and of necessity it does not encompass (as in ferguson) conduct related to the breakdown of the marriage (basically because it would not have had a sufficient duration for this impact to be relevant to contributions).[98]
perhaps the use of the word “quantification” is infelicitous and has unintentionally added a gloss to the ratio in kennon when, in truth, the court in spagnardi was merely reinforcing the need for there to be an evidentiary nexus between the conduct complained of and the capacity (and or effort expended) to make relevant contributions. and, depending upon the nature of the violence established, in the absence of express evidence about the effect that violence had on the victim spouse’s contributions, how difficult it might be for the court to draw inferences which would establish the evidentiary nexus[100]
made especially hard by the husband’s abuse and denigration of her and the children ... as well as by his attitude to ‘women’s work’ and by his drinking which necessitated the wife working especially hard and harder than would be usual in normal situations as homemaker, parent and as the prime navigator of the welfare of this family through the many seas of problems and difficulties which confronted them over the years.[102]
issue 7 – should the husband be able to enter the c street, suburb d property and undertake works to that property?
property proceedings under part viii and the approach in hickey and stanford
the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests
her honour seems to be saying that the mere fact that a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation, will result in that expenditure being added back “in the usual way” as a premature distribution of assets with nothing more. if that is what her honour is saying, in our view, she is being unduly simplistic. in our opinion, it was a necessary requirement for her honour to examine and make some assessment of the reasonableness or otherwise of the expenditure.
whilst not seeking to place a fetter upon the exercise of discretion of a trial judge in individual cases, it seems to us that the concept of adding monies reasonably disposed of back into the pool, ought be the exception rather than the rule. the parties are are entitled to reasonably conduct their affairs post separation in a manner that is consistent with properly getting on with their lives.
there seems to be no appropriate basis for notionally adding back monies that existed at separation but which have been subsequently spent on meeting reasonably incurred necessary living expenses. neither the family law act nor the case law requires that parties go into a state of suspended economic animation once their marriage breaks down pending the resolution of their financial arrangements. parties are entitled to continue to provide for their own support. whether any expenditure so incurred is reasonable or extravagant is a matter that can be determined by the trial judge.
in 2018 i was part way through having major dental work done when [mr massey] and i separated. my cancer treatment has made my dental condition much worse and the likely cost of it will be$10,000.00. [mr massey] had agreed that i could take the money from the house account to have the work done when we did the refinance in 2018. i removed the funds that had been set aside for some dental work at separation. however, after we separated i prioritised paying that money towards paying living expenses and was not able to apply it towards the dental work. at the same time that i withdrew money for the dental work i also withdrew an additional redraw of $10,500.00 to pay off the go mastercard that had been used to purchase the furniture and renovation fittings, most of which had been taken by [mr massey]. therefore the dental work remains outstanding.[116]

by reference to the parties’ existing legal and equitable property interests, is it just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79?
in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).
the parties' non-superannuation assets
section 79 (4)(a)-(c) — contributions
section 79 (4)(a) — direct financial contributions
we consider that the decision in baker and bilous indicate that the court in williams somewhat overstated the importance of the increase in value of a piece of property at the expense of “the myriad of other contributions that each of the parties has made during the course of the relationship” (williams at [26]).[132]
the approach adopted by the parties before her honour is repeated in the supplementary submissions filed on behalf of the respondent husband, it is there asserted that “the contributions of the parties would be equal aside from gifting by the husband’s father of significant parcels of land which remain in existence at the present point in time”. counsel for the wife, in his further submissions, makes no such specific assertion but implicitly does so by relying upon the trial judge’s findings and manner of assessment. for the reasons given earlier, we reject that approach, the gifts by the husband’s father should be taken into account as a contribution together with the miscellany of other contributions made by each of the parties over the course of their marriage.[134]
20. yet, that approach must also ensure that the “myriad of other contributions” and the duration over which, and circumstances in which, the miscellany of other s 79(4) contributions were made is not accorded a subsidiary role. the essential s 79(4) task is for “trial judges [to] weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation.[135]
as can be sees the primary judge weighed the myriad contributions made by the parties against the contribution made by the husband in bringing in property a rather than treating property a as one of the myriad contributions made.[136]
in our view, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred in proceedings pursuant to s.79 that moneys howsoever received by a party during the course of the parties’ cohabitation, are used by that party for the benefit of the family unit. such moneys, in those circumstances, thus constitute a financial contribution by the party who received the moneys.[147]
in parshen (1996) flc 92-720 at 83,665 the full court rejected contentions advanced on behalf of the respondent about the need for evidence to establish that moneys received during the course of a relationship were used for joint purposes. these principles apply during the parties’ cohabitation and the court should not depart from them unless satisfied on the evidence that it is appropriate to do so. the respondent bears the evidentiary onus in this regard because she is the person who makes the allegation.”[148]
section 79(4)(b) — indirect contributions to property
section 79(4)(c) — contributions to the welfare of the family, including contributions as homemaker or parent
although it is difficult, as it always is in such cases, to put one's finger squarely on what led his honour to so undervalue the wife's contribution, we think that one significant matter which did so was that he failed to give any weight to the fact that the wife's performance of her role as homemaker and parent during the 30 years of cohabitation was not just a contribution under s.79(4)(c) (which he subsequently recognized to some degree) but was also a significant contribution under s.79(4)(b). that point was made by the full court (nicholson, c.j., murray and buckley, jj.) in in the marriage of napthali (1988) 13 fam lr 146 at p 151, where their honours said:-
“turning now to the second ground of appeal, (which was that 'the court erred in law in failing to take into account contributions made by the wife during the marriage as homemaker and parent') it is apparent that nowhere in her honour's judgment does she consider the contribution of the wife to the business assets as a home-maker and parent. it is clear that the wife did perform this role and nowhere in the evidence or in the submissions was any criticism directed at her capacities in this regard. it is to be noted that in mallet v. mallet [1984] hca 21, (1984) 9 fam lr 449, (1984) flc 91-507, the high court whilst rejecting the proposition of a presumption of equality, approved statements by this court that the purpose of s 79(4)(b) is to give recognition to the position of the house wife who by her attention to the home and the children frees her husband to earn income and acquire assets and also approved the proposition that the contribution made by the wife as a home-maker and parent should be recognised not in a token way but in a substantial way: see gibbs c.j. at fam lr 451, flc 79,111, mason j. at fam lr 461-2, flc 119-20.”[166]
before turning to the wife’s evidence in this respect, it is desirable to say something about the corroboration of family violence. it is well settled that a party does not require their evidence of family violence to be corroborated before such evidence can be accepted. given the tendency of domestic violence to occur in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage and perhaps their children, this must necessarily be so: see keating & keating [2019] famcafc 46, (2019) flc 93-894 at [42] (ainslie-wallace and ryan jj) (“keating”), hendy & penningh [2018] famcafc 257, (2018) flc 93-879 at [72] (ainslie-wallace, ryan & austin jj), amador & amador [2009] famcafc 196, (2009) 43 fam lr 268 at [79] (may, coleman & le poer trench jj) (“amador”). whilst as a general principle it is important to identify a core consistency in the evidence of an alleged victim of family violence rather than concentrating on supposed inconsistencies in the evidence, this does not permit a court to ignore or otherwise dismiss inconsistencies in that evidence: keating at [62] (austin j), zuen & lhao [2020] famcafc 84 at [22]- [24] (ryan, aldridge and stevenson jj) (“zuen & lhao”). however the reference to the importance of identifying a core consistency, while important in cases involving family violence, must not obscure the reality that there cannot be a finding of family violence otherwise than in accordance with s 140 of the evidence act and having regard to all relevant matters: see amador at [86]-[93]. where allegations of family violence are made it is necessary for the court to make findings where the evidence enables that to be done: see zuen & lhao at [24].

section 75(2)(o) — any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account
... just as the husband's contribution to the welfare (including the financial support) of the wife's children of her former marriage, for the reasons given by his honour in the passage from his judgment last quoted (with which we agree), could not be taken into account as a contribution by him under s.79(4)(c), so too the wife's contribution to the welfare of those children could not be taken into account on that basis. however, as his honour did (in our view correctly) take the husband's contribution to those children into account under s.75(2)(o), the question arises whether he should have taken the wife's contribution to the welfare of those children into account also, under that paragraph of s.75(2). this raises the question whether the fact that a party to a marriage contributes during that marriage to the welfare of his or her own children of a prior marriage is a fact or circumstance which the justice of the case requires to be taken into account in that party's favour, at least, in circumstances where the other party's contribution to that welfare has been taken into account as a fact or circumstance in that party's favour. in considering whether the justice of a case requires some act done by a party to be taken into account under s.75(2)(o), the court should, we think, have regard primarily to the existence or otherwise of any legal obligations, as between the parties, in relation to the doing of that act, and also, perhaps, to ordinary notions of justice and equity between the parties. in this case, the wife had a legal duty to maintain the children of her prior marriage, which duty had primacy over the duty of any other person, other than the children's father, to so maintain them: ss.66a and 66b of the act. the husband, on the other hand, had no legal duty to maintain these children at any time during the marriage because, by s.66g, a step-parent has such a duty only if he or she is a guardian of the child, or has custody of the child by an order of a court, or a court having jurisdiction under part vii of the act by order determines that it is proper for the step-parent to have that duty. none of those pre-conditions existed in this case. accordingly, in contributing to the support of these children the wife was merely honouring a legal obligation which she owed to the children, whilst the husband, in making his contribution, was acting essentially as a volunteer assisting the wife in the discharge of her legal obligations. upon that basis, whilst we consider the justice of the case clearly required the husband's contribution to be taken into account under s 75(2)(o), the same cannot be said of the wife's contribution. in making that contribution the wife was in no way discharging or assisting to discharge any legal obligation of the husband. turning, then, to ordinary notions of justice and equity, we are of the view that such notions do not call for any allowance to be made in the wife's favour, in the property proceedings between the husband and wife, because she honoured her legal obligation to maintain her own children of a prior marriage. we believe that a failure to make such an allowance would not offend the ordinary reasonable man or woman's notions of justice.[178]

what is the just and equitable exercise of discretion?
... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s. 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[187]
