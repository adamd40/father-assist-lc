reasons for judgment
judge mcginn
the parties’ respective applications
the orders sought
the legal principles to be applied
the sources of evidence before the court
background
the need and/or benefit of overseas travel for x
consideration
consideration of s60cc matters  there are no relevant views expressed by x that relate specifically to the question of overseas travel, (b) x has a close and loving relationship with each of the parents and by the evidence contained in the family report, x has an appropriate relationship with members of the mother’s extended family, in particular her maternal uncle and with members of the father’s extended family, (c) each of the parties has taken up over time opportunities to the extent that their fluctuating relationship as parents has permitted to participate in decisions about x and her spending time with the father and her communication with each of the parents, (d) there is nothing in this case which indicates to me that the parties’ respective obligations to maintain x is a matter of any weight with respect to the issue that remains to be determined by this court as to travel, (e) it is not likely that there is to be any changes in x’s circumstances and in particular that her place of residence will be other than australia or that x will be separated from either her mother or father. if there were to be a change in x’s home country from australia that would be devastating for her welfare and development, (f) in the circumstances of this matter, there are no pressures, practical difficulties or expense that impedes upon x spending time with or communicating with each of the parents, (g) each of the parents have a capacity to meet x’s needs including her emotional and intellectual needs whilst she is in the respective care of her parents both here and, should the need arise, during holiday travel overseas, (h) x’s cultural background and that of the parents is important in relation to x’s understanding of herself and her general well-being and development. although x is not of an age whereby she might obtain what might be considered maximum benefit from overseas travel, i consider that she would still obtain a meaningful benefit from being able to travel overseas with a parent presently and, in particular, if she was to undertake that travel to country b, (i) each of the parents have demonstrated an understanding of the other parent’s importance to x and appropriate attitudes in their duties towards x and the responsibilities of parenthood. the father’s demonstrations are not of as great a significance as that demonstrated by the mother and the demonstration of appropriate attitudes is constrained in the context of the poor co-parenting relationship, (j) there have been allegations of family violence between the parties relating to events in 2017 and the obtaining of an apprehended violence order for a period of 12 months at that time. i was not assisted with any submissions in relation to this topic and i make no findings as to the matters related to this topic identified in each parties’ trial affidavit and the family report, and (k) i recognise and take into account that country b is not a party to the convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction (or as it was termed in the mother’s trial affidavit the “hague convention on child abduction”). this means that should x be detained in country b by either parent that the benefits of that convention in assisting the parent who has not then taken x overseas will not be available entailing extra expense and worry for that parent in having their time or living arrangements with x under the orders restored, (l) the father’s submission was that no orders should be made for overseas travel and that the matter of overseas travel be left to be dealt with on a case by case basis as and when the desire or need for overseas travel arises. although i must acknowledge that circumstances may arise in future where a need for overseas travel may irregularly and urgently arise on account of unexpected or unplanned events such as deaths in extended family living overseas, given the death of the mother’s parents these type of unplanned circumstances should be anticipated to be limited. further, i consider that it is in x’s interests that orders be made with respect to overseas travel upon the present applications leaving such emergency applications to be dealt with on a case to case basis.   x has a close and loving relationship with each of the parents and by the evidence contained in the family report, x has an appropriate relationship with members of the mother’s extended family, in particular her maternal uncle and with members of the father’s extended family, (c) each of the parties has taken up over time opportunities to the extent that their fluctuating relationship as parents has permitted to participate in decisions about x and her spending time with the father and her communication with each of the parents, (d) there is nothing in this case which indicates to me that the parties’ respective obligations to maintain x is a matter of any weight with respect to the issue that remains to be determined by this court as to travel, (e) it is not likely that there is to be any changes in x’s circumstances and in particular that her place of residence will be other than australia or that x will be separated from either her mother or father. if there were to be a change in x’s home country from australia that would be devastating for her welfare and development, (f) in the circumstances

case by case basis as and when the desire or need for overseas travel arises. although i must acknowledge that circumstances may arise in future where a need for overseas travel may irregularly and urgently arise on account of unexpected or unplanned events such as deaths in extended family living overseas, given the death of the mother’s parents these type of unplanned circumstances should be anticipated to be limited. further, i consider that it is in x’s interests that orders be made with respect to overseas travel upon the present applications leaving such emergency applications to be dealt with on a case to case basis.   i recognise and take into account that country b is not a party to the convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction (or as it was termed in the mother’s trial affidavit the “hague convention on child abduction”). this means that should x be detained in country b by either parent that the benefits of that convention in assisting the parent who has not then taken x overseas will not be available entailing extra expense and worry for that parent in having their time or living arrangements with x under the orders restored, (l) the father’s
