reasons for judgment
judge glass:
statutory framework
primary considerations
the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both of his parents
the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
additional considerations
any views expressed by x and any factors (such as his maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to his views
the nature of x’s relationships with each of his parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative
the extent to which each of x’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to him, to spend time with him, and to communicate with him
the extent to which each of x’s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain him
the likely effect of any changes in x’s circumstances, including the likely effect on x of any separation from either of his parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom he has been living
the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect his right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of x’s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of x, to provide for his needs, including emotional and intellectual needs
moving forward, it will be critical for [mr gulden] to develop skills and experience in environments which expose him to some of the more challenging, day to day aspects of parenting. [mr gulden]’s proposal that spend time arrangements should progress more towards a shared care schedule will only be viable if he gains greater knowledge and experience across elements of parenting such as children’s routines, nutritional requirements, and [x]’s developmental needs. furthermore, [mr gulden] will need to evidence some commitment around adapting his hours of work in order to meet [x]’s day to day needs.[17]
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of either of his parents, and any other relevant characteristics of x
if x is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child, x’s right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right
the attitude to x, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of his parents
both parties reported that they are unable to effectively interact with one another in any matters pertaining to [x]’s needs. both parties are desirous of these communications improving, though neither party could identify how to facilitate this.[23]
any family violence involving x or a member of x’s family  in april 2019, mr gulden grabbed the steering wheel of a vehicle being driven by ms nazmi, causing them to veer off the road. he then punched the car door before exiting the vehicle. he subsequently grabbed ms nazmi by the throat. when ms nazmi tried to leave, he jumped on the hood of the vehicle, trying to stop her leaving. (b) on several occasions during the parties’ relationship, when he was upset or angry, mr gulden hit or kicked walls, cupboards, and other objects. his behaviour caused ms nazmi to be extremely fearful of him and to suffer anxiety. (c) in december 2020, mr gulden was angry and verbally abusive towards ms nazmi. he said to her “i will make sure i get x taken off you and you will never see him again”.[29]   on several occasions during the parties’ relationship, when he was upset or angry, mr gulden hit or kicked walls, cupboards, and other objects. his behaviour caused ms nazmi to be extremely fearful of him and to suffer anxiety. (c) in december 2020, mr gulden was angry and verbally abusive towards ms nazmi. he said to her “i will make sure i get x taken off you and you will never see him again”.[29]   in december 2020, mr gulden was angry and verbally abusive towards ms nazmi. he said to her “i will make sure i get x taken off you and you will never see him again”.[29]
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to x or a member of his family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, and any other relevant matter
whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x
any other relevant fact or circumstance
parental responsibility
... the sharing of parental responsibility is a viable and reasonable proposal. if [ms nazmi] was to have sole parental responsibility for [x], then there is the possibility that she may impede upon [x]’s ability to maintain a meaningful relationship with [ms nazmi].[31]
