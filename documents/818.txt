39. the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application brought pursuant to the provisions of s 79. that approach involves four inter-related steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing. secondly, the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of ss.79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly, the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in ss.79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), (“the other factors”) including, because of s.79(4)(e), the matters referred to in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case. (citations omitted)
19. these three aspects echo three of the four steps or stages developed in [hickey]. adherence to those four steps is not mandatory, and the approach “merely illuminates the path to the ultimate result” (see norman & norman [2010] famcafc 66 at [60]). indeed in martin & newton [2011] famcafc 233, (2011) flc 93-490 at 86,127, it was said of the four step calculus:
305. ... [t]hat approach is not legislatively mandated, and as the full court [in hickey] said, is simply the preferred approach. this is because it will be sufficient, in most cases, to have regard to the overall justice and equity of the orders after determination of the asset pool, consideration of contributions and assessment of the relevant s75(2) matters.
146. the finding of not being satisfied that the plaintiff lived on a full-time basis with the deceased in the relevant period is of central importance to whether a de facto relationship existed. it should be recalled that the list of “circumstances” in section 4(2) are reminders of matters that possibly might be relevant in deciding whether two people are in a de facto relationship, but do not state its essence. the essence is to be found in the definition in section 4(1). if two people do not “live together as a couple” they do not satisfy the definition of being in a de facto relationship, regardless of what might be the situation concerning the various “circumstances” listed in section 4(2).
