the property is owned by the husband. no order is sought with respect to it by the wife. there is no reason for the court to order its sale. the husband is free to sell it or retain it as he chooses. ... the orders 6, 7 and 8 in the minute of order relied upon by the husband are entirely unnecessary. he is to retain the property. what he does with it is a matter for him and requires no intervention by the court.
it is an investment property. the husband has sought its sale. it is plain that there will be costs and cgt liabilities which need to be included. the husband was not cross-examined on his minute. the husband’s minute provides mechanisms to properly ascertain the value of the pool available between the parties. it is difficult to see how if the wife says that the husband should be required to retain a property hours away from his workplace and the child with whom he spends regular time.
determination of application to re-open  in reid v brett (2005) vsc 18 the criteria governing the exercise of the discretionary power to re-open a case to admit further evidence where the hearing has concluded but judgment has not been delivered, was said to be as follows: (a) the further evidence is so material that the interests of justice require its admission, (b) the further evidence, if accepted, would most probably effect the result of the case, (c) the further evidence could not by reasonable diligence have been discovered earlier, (d) no prejudice would ensue to the other party by reason of the late admission of the further evidence.   the further evidence is so material that the interests of justice require its admission, (b) the further evidence, if accepted, would most probably effect the result of the case, (c) the further evidence could not by reasonable diligence have been discovered earlier, (d) no prejudice would ensue to the other party by reason of the late admission of the further evidence.   the further evidence, if accepted, would most probably effect the result of the case, (c) the further evidence could not by reasonable diligence have been discovered earlier, (d) no prejudice would ensue to the other party by reason of the late admission of the further evidence.   the further evidence could not by reasonable diligence have been discovered earlier, (d) no prejudice would ensue to the other party by reason of the late admission of the further evidence.   no prejudice would ensue to the other party by reason of the late admission of the further evidence.   the sale (and therefore current value) of the c town property, and (b) the husband’s cgt liability with respect to the c town property, and (c) the current value of the suburb e property.   the husband’s cgt liability with respect to the c town property, and (c) the current value of the suburb e property.   the current value of the suburb e property.
effect of the further evidence
the full court in varnham & moses [2021] famcafc 19, (2021) flc 94-006 made it apparent (at 60) that the court had to analyse the effect of the adjustment in “real money terms”. in wallis & manning [2017] famcafc 14, (2017) flc 93-759, the full court noted (at 169) the “dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests of the parties”. that value of the interests of the parties is now significantly less than presumed in the former joint balance sheet, hence the dollar value of the adjustment changes. this occasions mathematical consequence in “real money terms”.

contributions during the course of the relationship ]. at this time [late 2003] we were operating a joint bank account with [sic] and we applied to job share during our intern year to share the care of [their daughter]. when we eventually started earning, both our salaries were being deposited into that account which we used to pay rent, utility bills, groceries and food, entertainment and other day-to-day expenses. our salaries were often insufficient and that is when [mr newtown] told me that i needed to sell some of my shares. i estimate that i sold $20,000 worth of shares.  ]. i am aware [mr newtown] asserts that he received a gift of $100,000 from his parents in mid-2008. i am not aware of this, if he did, it must have been paid into his own bank account not the joint one and he would have spent it on his sports and recreational activities. later on, when [mr newtown’s] parents wanted to gift some money to us, they gave those funds directly to me.  . while some of the funds given by my husband and i were directed to both [mr newtown] and [ms hammond], those amounts were intended to benefit their entire family .... the application of those funds to [mr newtown] and [ms hammond] was motivated by our desire to assist our children and their families. we would not have given money to [ms hammond] but for her relationship with [mr newtown] and because she is the mother of [mr newtown's] children.   there was always ongoing discussions about living to a budget and working out allowances for each of them for personal and incidental expenses. money had been tight for years, as they juggled the demands of finishing their training and raising children. the husband often held two jobs at a time and the wife was for many years at home with the girls and working reduced hours. (b) the wife chose to work less and spend more time caring for the girls. he supported this decision and was appreciative of it in a practical way, despite his own desire to spend more time at home caring for the children. they could not afford for both of them to do this concurrently and he deferred to the wife's wishes. (c) both parties were committed to and worked hard for their family. the husband earnt the majority of the family income and the wife provided the majority of care for the children. from his perspective, it was a team effort and things were often challenging for them financially and as result of working long and not core (family friendly) hours.   the wife chose to work less and spend more time caring for the girls. he supported this decision and was appreciative of it in a practical way, despite his own desire to spend more time at home caring for the children. they could not afford for both of them to do this concurrently and he deferred to the wife's wishes.
