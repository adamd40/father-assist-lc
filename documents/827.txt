section 90 sm(3) of the act
contributions
section 90sf(3) of the act ] to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are: (a) where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in in the marriage of djm and jlm (1998) 23 fam lr 396 , (1998) flc 92-816 , [1998] famca 97 the full court said at [11.6]   where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in in the marriage of djm and jlm (1998) 23 fam lr 396 , (1998) flc 92-816 , [1998] famca 97 the full court said at [11.6]
[11.6] for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in in the marriage of townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505 , (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at fam lr 509 , flc 81,654: in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband’s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly. (c) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in in the marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) 7 fam ln n13 , (1981) flc 91-092 at flc 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. conduct of the kind referred to in para (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under s 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of s 79.  where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in in the marriage of townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505 , (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at fam lr 509 , flc 81,654:   in the circumstances outlined by baker j in in the marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) 7 fam ln n13 , (1981) flc 91-092 at flc 76,644:   where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.   where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.
...  ] her honour seems to be saying that the mere fact that a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation, will result in that expenditure being added back “in the usual way” as a premature distribution of assets with nothing more. if that is what her honour is saying, in our view, she is being unduly simplistic. in our opinion, it was a necessary requirement for her honour to examine and make some assessment of the reasonableness or otherwise of the expenditure.  ] we observe that “notional property”, which is sometimes “added back” to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute “property of the parties to the marriage or either of them”, and thus is not amenable to alteration under s 79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage – and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that s 79(4) and in particular s 75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property.
...once it has been established that there has been a deliberate non disclosure, which follows from his honour’s findings in this case, then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. to do otherwise might be thought to provide a charter for fraud in proceedings of this nature.   between 23 november 2019 and 29 february 2020, the de facto husband, from bank account ending #...42 was regularly making atm withdrawals of $1,000 each, a cash withdrawal of $20,000 was made on 2 december 2020, foreign telegraphic transfers of $5,000 each were made on three occasions, and with other foreign telegraphic transfers made for lesser sums during such period. cash withdrawals of $5,000 each were made on at least two occasions during this period, (b) between 20 march 2020 and 3 july 2020, from account ending #...42, various withdrawals in country v appear in account ending #...42 in sums slightly in excess of about $1,000, (c) on 25 november 2019 the de facto husband transferred $600,000 from his account ending #...42 to his bank account ending #...60, (d) then between 25 may 2020 and 1 june 2020 the de facto husband made six separate transfers of $100,000 each back to his account ending #...42, (e) between 25 may 2020 and 3 june 2020 the de facto husband transferred $500,000 overseas through ten separate transfers of $50,000 from account ending #...42 (with the court observing that the bank statement entry for each transfer refers to “internet overseas tt”).   between 20 march 2020 and 3 july 2020, from account ending #...42, various withdrawals in country v appear in account ending #...42 in sums slightly in excess of about $1,000, (c) on 25 november 2019 the de facto husband transferred $600,000 from his account ending #...42 to his bank account ending #...60, (d) then between 25 may 2020 and 1 june 2020 the de facto husband made six separate transfers of $100,000 each back to his account ending #...42, (e) between 25 may 2020 and 3 june 2020 the de facto husband transferred $500,000 overseas through ten separate transfers of $50,000 from account ending #...42 (with the court observing that the bank statement entry for each transfer refers to “internet overseas tt”).   on 25 november 2019 the de facto husband transferred $600,000 from his account ending #...42 to his bank account ending #...60, (d) then between 25 may 2020 and 1 june 2020 the de facto husband made six separate transfers of $100,000 each back to his account ending #...42, (e) between 25 may 2020 and 3 june 2020 the de facto husband transferred $500,000 overseas through ten separate transfers of $50,000 from account ending #...42 (with the court observing that the bank statement entry for each transfer refers to “internet overseas tt”).   then between 25 may 2020 and 1 june 2020 the de facto husband made six separate transfers of $100,000 each back to his account ending #...42, (e) between 25 may 2020 and 3 june 2020 the de facto husband transferred $500,000 overseas through ten separate transfers of $50,000 from account ending #...42 (with the court observing that the bank statement entry for each transfer refers to “internet overseas tt”).   between 25 may 2020 and 3 june 2020 the de facto husband transferred $500,000 overseas through ten separate transfers of $50,000 from account ending #...42 (with the court observing that the bank statement entry for each transfer refers to “internet overseas tt”).   from the sale proceeds of the u street, town k property the r street, town q property was purchased in the sum of $655,000, and after payment of $58,740 relating to the expenses associated with such sale and purchase, the de facto husband received $919,442 in late november 2019, (b) from the sum of $919,442, the total trust monies of $344,001 presently exist, the difference between these two sums is an amount of $575,441, however the court observes that the claimed addback of the de facto wife is the lesser sum of $555,441 (see paragraph 148 of the de facto wife’s trial affidavit and her case outline referring to the claimed addback which both refer to a sum of $555,441). this sum of $555,441 was the amount that the de facto husband was confronted with in these property proceedings as an amount that he had allegedly failed to account for from the proceeds of sale of the u street, town k property, not the higher amount of $575,441, (c) item 2 – hospital bill in country v, 18 days, $60,000: the de facto husband stated that the majority of his hospital receipts were left in country v. the de facto husband annexes to his affidavit filed 22 october 2020 some hospital bills totalling about 72,015 country v, which sum translates to about aud3,024. the hospital bill for ac hospital for just one overnight admission (from 3 october 2020 to 4 october 2020) was 27,615 which converts to about aud1,160. the annexed hospital bills appear to relate to only about four days of hospital treatment, again totalling about aud3,024. the court accepts that the de facto husband spent 18 days in total in country v hospitals. adding a further 14 days of hospital expenses at $1,160 per day one arrives at $16,240. the court finds that the de facto husband’s reasonable hospital expenditure in country v (18 days) was $19,264 ($3,024 + $16,240), (d) item 3 – tractor, water pump and machinery in country v, $145,000: the de facto husband stated that he had purchased such goods for his new wife and such goods presently exist on her mother’s farm in country v and such money was reflected in his bank account ending #...42 at page 45 of the de facto wife’s trial affidavit. the court accepts that about this sum of money was spent on such goods in country v, however such expenditure should be found to constitute a premature distribution of assets arising out of the parties de facto relationship by the de facto husband, and which should be taken into account by the court under section 90sf(3)(r) in favour of the de facto wife as discussed below, (e) items 4, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 33, are found by the court to represent reasonable expenditure by the de facto husband relating to his living related expenses post separation, (f) items 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 21, are found by the court to represent reasonable expenditure by the de facto husband relating to various repair and other expenditures for the r street, town q property after its purchase, (g) items 28, 29, 30, 32, are found by the court to represent reasonable expenditure by the de facto husband relating to the purchase of various items of equipment likely purchased to enable him to earn income as a licensed dealer in the buying and selling of such goods and/or to maintain the r street, town q property, with the court accepting that items 28 and 29 were stolen with the de facto husband having no insurance, (h) item 31 – money in safe stolen from the r street, town q property, $30,000: the court accepts the de facto husband’s evidence in relation to this item, in particular that such monies were placed in the safe before the de facto husband travelled to country v (the de facto husband originally only intending to travel to country v for about two weeks), that such monies were intended for the purchase of a shed to be put on the property at r street, town q, and that such monies were stolen, (i) as to items 13 (visa for de facto husband’s new wife: $18,000), item 14 (money to support de facto husband’s new wife: $20,000), item 15 (visa agent for de facto husband’s new wife: $2000), items 26 and 27 (wedding and party and wedding ring for de facto husband’s new wife: $10,500), item 23 (transfer money from country v to sydney: $20,000 being unexplained expenditure by de facto husband): such expenditures should be found to constitute premature distributions of assets arising out of the parties’ de facto relationship (such assets being monies arising from the sale of the u street, town k property which property arose out of the parties’ de facto relationship) by the de facto husband, and which should be taken into account by the court under 90sf(3)(r) in favour of the de facto wife as discussed below.   from the sum of $919,442, the total trust monies of $344,001 presently exist, the difference between these two sums is an amount of $575,441, however the court observes that the claimed addback of the de facto wife is the lesser sum of $555,441 (see paragraph 148 of the de facto wife’s trial affidavit and her case outline referring to the claimed addback which both refer to a sum of $555,441). this sum of $555,441 was the amount that the de facto husband was confronted with in these property proceedings as an amount that he had allegedly failed to account for from the proceeds of sale of the u street, town k property, not the higher amount of $575,441, (c) item 2 – hospital bill in country v, 18 days, $60,000: the de facto husband stated that the majority of his hospital receipts were left in country v. the de facto husband annexes to his affidavit filed 22 october 2020 some hospital bills totalling about 72,015 country v, which sum translates to about aud3,024. the hospital bill for ac hospital for just one overnight admission (from 3 october 2020 to 4 october 2020) was 27,615 which converts to about aud1,160. the annexed hospital bills appear to relate to only about four days of hospital treatment, again totalling about aud3,024. the court accepts that the de facto husband spent 18 days in total in country v hospitals. adding a further 14 days of hospital expenses at $1,160 per day one arrives at $16,240. the court finds that the de facto husband’s reasonable hospital expenditure in country v (18 days) was $19,264 ($3,024 + $16,240), (d) item 3 – tractor, water pump and machinery in country v, $145,000: the de facto husband stated that he had purchased such goods for his new wife and such goods presently exist on her mother’s farm in country v and such money was reflected in his bank account ending #...42 at page 45 of the de facto wife’s trial affidavit. the court accepts that about this sum of money was spent on such goods in country v, however such expenditure should be found to constitute a premature distribution of assets arising out of the parties de facto relationship by the de facto husband, and which should be taken into account by the court under section 90sf(3)(r) in favour of the de facto wife as discussed below, (e) items 4, 19, 20, 22, 24, 25, 33, are found by the court to represent reasonable expenditure by the de facto husband relating to his living related expenses post separation, (f) items 1, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 16, 17, 18, 21, are found by the court to represent reasonable expenditure by the de facto husband relating to various repair and other expenditures for the r street, town q property after its purchase, (g) items 28, 29, 30, 32, are found by the court to represent reasonable expenditure by the de facto husband relating to the purchase of various items of equipment likely purchased to enable him to earn income as a licensed dealer in the buying and selling of such goods and/or to maintain the r street, town q property, with the court accepting that items 28 and 29 were stolen with the de facto husband having no insurance, (h) item 31 – money in safe stolen from the r street, town q property, $30,000: the court accepts the de facto husband’s evidence in relation to this item, in particular that such monies were placed in the safe before the de facto husband travelled to country v (the de facto husband originally only intending to travel to country v for about two weeks), that such monies were intended for the purchase of a shed to be put on the property at r street, town q, and that such monies were stolen, (i) as to items 13 (visa for de facto husband’s new wife: $18,000), item 14 (money to
