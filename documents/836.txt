discussion and findings  that each party has annexed conversation they have had in the parenting app which reflects in the main mutually respectful, polite and appropriate conversations. i acknowledge that there is some squabbling and miscommunication but am of the view that this is the exception rather than the rule, (b) neither parent has annexed inappropriate or rude communications between them, (c) while the mother complains of the father’s delays in responding at times, i am not pointed to any examples which indicate excessive or detrimental delays other than the father missing out on a father’s day event due to his own delay, (d) while the father fails to provide the mother with a direct answer about school fees he does respond, though i accept he needs to make his position clear, (e) as regards the arrangements for father’s day, each party’s evidence is vague to say the least. neither party provides any specific evidence about when the information came to hand about the function at kindy. the father’s evidence is that he became aware in “late august” and that he responded on 2 september. the mother gives affidavit evidence that he had two weeks to respond and failed to do so. the father concedes that he should have responded sooner and that his failure to do so meant that he and x both missed out.   neither parent has annexed inappropriate or rude communications between them, (c) while the mother complains of the father’s delays in responding at times, i am not pointed to any examples which indicate excessive or detrimental delays other than the father missing out on a father’s day event due to his own delay, (d) while the father fails to provide the mother with a direct answer about school fees he does respond, though i accept he needs to make his position clear, (e) as regards the arrangements for father’s day, each party’s evidence is vague to say the least. neither party provides any specific evidence about when the information came to hand about the function at kindy. the father’s evidence is that he became aware in “late august” and that he responded on 2 september. the mother gives affidavit evidence that he had two weeks to respond and failed to do so. the father concedes that he should have responded sooner and that his failure to do so meant that he and x both missed out.   while the mother complains of the father’s delays in responding at times, i am not pointed to any examples which indicate excessive or detrimental delays other than the father missing out on a father’s day event due to his own delay, (d) while the father fails to provide the mother with a direct answer about school fees he does respond, though i accept he needs to make his position clear, (e) as regards the arrangements for father’s day, each party’s evidence is vague to say the least. neither party provides any specific evidence about when the information came to hand about the function at kindy. the father’s evidence is that he became aware in “late august” and that he responded on 2 september. the mother gives affidavit evidence that he had two weeks to respond and failed to do so. the father concedes that he should have responded sooner and that his failure to do so meant that he and x both missed out.   while the father fails to provide the mother with a direct answer about school fees he does respond, though i accept he needs to make his position clear, (e) as regards the arrangements for father’s day, each party’s evidence is vague to say the least. neither party provides any specific evidence about when the information came to hand about the function at kindy. the father’s evidence is that he became aware in “late august” and that he responded on 2 september. the mother gives affidavit evidence that he had two weeks to respond and failed to do so. the father concedes that he should have responded sooner and that his failure to do so meant that he and x both missed out.   as regards the arrangements for father’s day, each party’s evidence is vague to say the least. neither party provides any specific evidence about when the information came to hand about the function at kindy. the father’s evidence is that he became aware in “late august” and that he responded on 2 september. the mother gives affidavit evidence that he had two weeks to respond and failed to do so. the father concedes that he should have responded sooner and that his failure to do so meant that he and x both missed out.
part four: the law  when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
...   the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: (a) abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or   family violence.   ... (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
in our view, the mandatory requirement to apply the presumption, unless the evidence satisfies the court that it is not in the best interests of the child, makes it necessary for there to be explicit and cogent reasons why the presumption should be rebutted.
...[i]n our view it is clear from the legislative scheme that any intervention by the court in the due performance of an aspect of parental responsibility, that seeks to interfere with or diminish the responsibility of either parent to care for the child in the manner the parent deems appropriate, should be made only where the court is of the view that the welfare of the child will be clearly advanced by that order being made.   the order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons. ... (3) the order is taken to require each of those persons: (a) to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and (b) to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and (b) to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.
it appears to us that as a parenting order, including an order for equal shared parental responsibility, must be in the best interests of a child, a court may in the exercise of its discretion find it is inappropriate to make such an order in certain circumstances. this could occur where, although there is no family violence or child abuse, the conflict or lack of effective communication between the parents is such that to properly exercise their equal shared parental responsibility they would be unable to comply with s 65dac by consulting and making a genuine effort to reach agreement about major long-term issues affecting their child or children. in other words, in these circumstances an order for equal shared parental responsibility would inevitably lead to further conflict and perhaps contravention applications, which conflict and/or ongoing litigation could be adverse to the child’s best interests.
part five: application of the law
departure orders  a liable parent or a carer entitled to child support may, in respect of an administrative assessment of child support for a child, apply to a court having jurisdiction under this act for an order under this division in relation to the child in the special circumstances of the case if: (b) both of the following apply: (i) the liable parent or carer entitled to child support is a party to an application pending in a court having jurisdiction under this act, (ii) the court is satisfied that it would be in the interest of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support for the court to consider whether an order should be made under this division in relation to the child in the special circumstances of the case, or (c) in the case of a liable parent—the administrative assessment of child support payable by the liable parent for the child is made under subsection 66(1).   both of the following apply: (i) the liable parent or carer entitled to child support is a party to an application pending in a court having jurisdiction under this act, (ii) the court is satisfied that it would be in the interest of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support for the court to consider whether an order should be made under this division in relation to the child in the special circumstances of the case, or (c) in the case of a liable parent—the administrative assessment of child support payable by the liable parent for the child is made under subsection 66(1).   the liable parent or carer entitled to child support is a party to an application pending in a court having jurisdiction under this act, (ii) the court is satisfied that it would be in the interest of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support for the court to consider whether an order should be made under this division in relation to the child in the special circumstances of the case, or  ) the court is satisfied that it would be in the interest of the liable parent and the carer entitled to child support for the court to consider whether an order should be made under this division in relation to the child in the special circumstances of the case, or   in the case of a liable parent—the administrative assessment of child support payable by the liable parent for the child is made under subsection 66(1).

other considerations
part six: consideration
part seven: determination  the father’s evidence that the mother enrolled the child in kindy without his consent, noting that this is denied by the mother, (b) the difficulties the father has had engaging with the kindergarten and his inability to collect the child from kindy despite his efforts as reflected in the parents’ communication app, (c) the fact that the mother had not listed the father as an emergency contact on the child’s enrolment at kindy as reflected in the father’s communication with the kindy, (d) the troubling fact that his attempts to engage with the kindy were reported by the mother to the family report writer as indicative of a likelihood that the father may abscond with the child. there is absolutely no evidence to support such a suggestion, (e) the mother’s evidence that she views the father signing the school enrolment form for c school as “blackmail” in circumstances where the consent orders of 7 february 2022 bear a notation that it is her wish that the child attend that school. this is in circumstances where the father’s evidence is that he cannot afford to contribute to the fees, which the mother estimated at $12,168. i do not agree that the father’s action amounts to blackmail, (f) the mother’s refusal to concede that the communication between herself and the father had been good. her evidence was that there have been no communication of any “worth”. she did concede however that it had improved since they started using the parenting app and that each parent responded to the other, even though they may not get the response they seek. i am of the view that the parents have positive and meaningful communications – they just sometimes don’t agree and have struggled to manage that, (g) the mother’s evidence that every single time the child returned from the father’s care he struggled with allergic reactions and she placed this firmly at the father’s door. this is a sweeping and scathing generalisation for which there is no independent evidence, (h) while the mother initially gave evidence that she simply wanted to choose the school, under cross examination she gave evidence that she wished to make all decisions in relation to educational matters and in particular in relation to financial matters where the father did not contribute financially. i am of the view that this is a harsh and inappropriate response to the father’s position, (i) that in the notice of child abuse, family violence and risk filed on 15 october 2021 the mother states that the father suffers ocd, anxiety and depression and that she doesn’t want “these aspects projected onto our son”. this is a harsh view indeed, (j) in their direct communication the mother made it clear to the father that if he was not contributing financially then he would have limited involvement in what happened at school. fortunately by the time of trial her position had softened and she agrees that regardless of his financial input the father would be able to attend at the school, obtain school documents and be kept informed and consulted. that is only right and proper.   the difficulties the father has had engaging with the

attend at the school, obtain school documents and be kept informed and consulted. that is only right and proper.   i agree that for equal shared parental responsibility to work there needs to be communication. i have viewed the communications between the parties as annexed to the affidavit material and in the court book. that communication is polite, respectful and child focused. the difficulty is that they have just been dancing around the hard discussion of expenses and child support. now that each parties’ position is clearly on the table they can negotiate more meaningfully, (b) i was asked to consider that the parties were not effectively communicating, that while polite they had not actually achieved anything. in my view this was due to a failure to say outright what they wanted. this is no reason to deny a child the right of input from both parents – this is a fixable issue, (c) the mother conceded that she had not always been clear on what she had said to the father, in particular about child support. she concedes that it was not solely the father’s issue. she gave evidence that whatever orders were made about the cost of the child’s education she would not take that to the child support and seek to increase the child support assessment. this was an impressive concession, (d) i accept the mother’s evidence that she said she welcomed it when the father called the doctor and she encouraged him to do so. i accept that the mother wants the father to be involved in and informed about x’s health, (e) i do not accept that the parties’ inability to reach agreement as to parental responsibility, particularly the child’s school, is reflective of their inability to compromise overall, (f) i was asked to consider that the father placed finances above the best interests of the child. as noted earlier i am not of the view that a refusal or inability to pay private school fees means that the father is not child focused, (g) i accept that the mother will do whatever is necessary to achieve the best outcome for the child. i am of the view that the father will also do whatever is necessary to achieve the best outcome for x, (h) the parents have attended several mediations and they have worked hard and achieved consent on the majority of issues. i have confidence that the child focus of both will mean that they will continue in that work, (i) i do not accept that if an order is made for equal shared parental responsibility that the parents would struggle to agree if there was any financial aspect. that is too sweeping a generalisation based on the evidence to hand and where there is only that one outstanding issue, (j) i accept the father’s evidence that the communication between the parties had improved over time. this is certainly supported by the parenting app. (k) the family report writer interviewed both parents and reviewed the material, and formed the view that equal shared parental responsibility was in the child’s best interests provided that the court can be satisfied that the father will respond in a timely fashion. i am satisfied that both parents have the capacity to improve their communication. i am satisfied that the father is aware that delay has been to the detriment of himself and x, (l) the family report writer talks of the unusual start to their co-parenting relationship and the lack of trust between the parties. he recommends family therapy. i am reassured by the fact that the parties’ reached agreement on all issues save this issue. (m) in relation to the difficulties arranging the child’s enrolment in school, i am of the view that fault lies with both parties. the father has signed the enrolment forms for the mother’s compromise school on the basis that the mother alone would need to meet those fees. the issue of choice of school is resolved. (n) the mother has provided information to the father about health issues. the father’s evidence is that he followed that advice and also attended on the child’s gp on multiple occasions to ensure he was fully informed as to allergies and sensitivities. i have accepted that evidence.
