we have decided we will, move to darwin. a situation came up whilst living at my parents and it’s not an environment that i wanted the children around, and therefore we were no longer able to stay there full time. please note that this move will not affect your visits with the children. i will have them back as per the court orders. i will be looking at enrolling the kids in school on monday and touch base with you then. i recently purchased a house for holiday rentals so we could come and stay when it was not in use. we will move into this house! as per orders to notify you of an address change, our new address will be [f street, suburb g, n.t.] thank you for your understanding in this matter. [ms calligan].
the main reason for the move was the kids are upset with mums drinking, this was bringing up bad memories of their life when they were around you and your drinking habits. therefore, i put their best interests first and took them out of that situation. i understand you’re not happy. the kids are happy with this decision and very excited. [ms calligan].
we are in darwin!
