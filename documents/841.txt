[the mother]'s licence was also suspended from the 22nd december 2010 for a period of 17 months. these records indicate that [the mother] has been recorded for exceeding the prescribed concentration of alcohol within 3 hours after driving or being in charge of a motor vehicle on the 11th july 2013, and the 22nd december 2010[.] [the father] presented as a calm and engaging man who spoke openly about the parents' relationship and his relationship with [the child]. he claimed that the parents' separated in 2015 before [the child] was conceived and yet they had a sporadic relationship over the last six (6) years. overall, [the father] spoke positively about [the mother] who claimed that she was a good person and a great mum "80% of the time," however, he held significant concerns regarding her excessive consumption of alcohol which he believed was detrimental to her relationships and her parenting capacity.  phasis added) [the mother] impressed as a quietly spoken and passive woman. she reported that she was assisted during the day of interviews by her stepfather ... who cared for [the child] during the morning. she claimed that she did not wish to come into the presence of [the father], stating that she was fearful of him following his assault upon her in july 2019. while [the mother] advocated relocating permanently to queensland, during her interview, she also provided future alternate plans if the court restricted [the child] from leaving the [city c] area.
... in her affidavit material, [the mother] reported that she obtained part-time work in august 2018 as a [hospitality worker], working between nine (9) and 22 hours per week, with her mother and [the father] sharing the care of [the child] during her work hours, with [the father] typically caring for [the child] on wednesday and friday evenings. [the mother] admitted to returning to [the father]'s home on these nights after work to take over the care of [the child]. however, she claimed that [the father] was constantly abusive, both verbally and via text message throughout this time. ... following [the father] obtaining [the mother]'s interlock records, he suspected that [the mother] would commence drinking alcohol at the end of her shifts and inform him that she was working a double shift. he also expressed significant concern regarding the times when [the mother]'s interlock records were matched with days [the mother] had enrolled [the child] in childcare. he claimed that the combination of these two (2) records suggested that [the mother] may have been intoxicated while caring for [the child]. ... [the mother] claimed that [the father] had perpetrated ongoing family violence against her, inclusive of verbal, physical and sexual abuse, abusive text messages and threats to kill. many of these text messages have been attached to her affidavit material to support her claims. in discussing family violence issues, [the father] admitted that on occasions he had sent aggressive text messages and said inappropriate things to [the mother]. he claimed he regretted these occasions and the parents had a volatile relationship, citing that the parents engaged in mutual verbal violence. he claimed, "there was lots of arguing to and fro, six years of it." while [the father] admitted to sending the derogatory text messages to [the mother], he indicated that [the mother] had six (6) years of [information on] her telephone which he did not have as he had used three (3) different mobile phones over this period. [the mother] claimed that she fears requiring to consistently communicate with [the father], that she feels that the majority of his communication comprises of threats, denigration and abuse and believes that orders relating to shared parental care would only lead to ongoing abuse. she claimed that [the father] also exposed [the child] to his derogatory verbal violence towards her. during his interview, [the father] reported that reading the multiple abusive text messages in one (1) document shocked him into acknowledging the extent to which it was inappropriate behaviour towards [the mother]. he stated, "it looked worse when you put 10 pages in front of you.” he also noted that over the six (6) years of text messages between the parents, there had also been positive interaction which was not recorded by [the mother]. [the father] reported that he had enrolled in [the service], to access counselling in relation to his anger management issues.  phasis added) [the father] conceded that he had sent derogatory text messages and was verbally abusive "in the heat of the moment.” he claimed that while he had made threats to harm [the mother], that he would never have followed through on these threats, reinforcing that he cared for and respected [the mother]. upon reflecting upon his verbally violent and aggressive text messages directed as [the mother], be stated, “it is time for me to grow up.'' (emphasis added)
... in her affidavit material, [the mother] claimed that she fled to her father's home in queensland with [the child] after an incident on 27th july 2019 whereby she reported [the father] returned home highly intoxicated after attending an afl football match and being involved in a fight. she reported that the parents argued, and she went to check on [the child] who was sleeping on [the father]'s bed. she claimed that [the father] assaulted her and raped her, only ceasing when [the child] awoke. at this time, she was able to take [the child] to her room, however, she claimed that [the father] continued to threaten her, saying, “if [the child] wasn't here you would be dead.” ... [the mother] noted that while she held concerns for her safety in the presence of [the father], she held no safety concerns for [the child] in the care of his father. however, upon further questioning, [the mother] conceded that she may be concerned regarding [the child]’s future exposure to family violence in the event [the father] re-partnered. [the mother] reported that [the child] loved her father, enjoyed spending time with him and missed him during their time in queensland. she reported that she facilitated an additional visit between [the child] and her father upon her return to victoria as [the child] wished to see her father.  phasis added)
... when [the child] observed her father entering the premises, she shimmied out of [the mother’s stepfather]'s arms until he placed her on the ground. [the child] then ran to her father, excitedly yelling "daddy, daddy.'' [the father] picked up [the child] for a cuddle and then walked over to shake [the mother’s stepfather]'s hand. [the child] snuggled into her father for the first five (5) minutes of their observation session and was reluctant to be placed back on the ground to play.
... throughout her play, [the child] was intermittently affectionate with her father giving him hugs and telling him that she missed him. throughout this time, [the child] requested to return to her father's home and was confused as to why she needed to remain playing with her father in this environment.  phasis added) at the end of this observation sessions, [the child] was reluctant to return to [the mother’s stepfather] and attempted to hold onto her father, stating that she wished to go home with him. both [the father] and [the mother’s stepfather] managed the situation well with both men reinforcing that [the child] needed to wait for her mother to arrive and that she would be seeing her father during the week. [the child] enjoyed an affectionate departure from her father while [the father] and [the mother’s stepfather] interacted in a positive and respectful manner.
... both parents agree that [the father] was the primary perpetrator of verbal and emotional violence towards [the mother], inclusive of threats to harm and threats to kill during conflict instigated incidences of family violence throughout their relationship and post-separation. [the mother] attached [to] her affidavit material examples of [the father]'s, violent and aggressive and demeaning text messages he would send her when he was angry. during his interview, [the father] did not minimise his behaviours but took responsibility for his demeaning behaviour towards [the mother]. he expressed that seeing his text messages over many years being compiled into one document was a ‘wake-up call', and he expressed remorse for his behaviours during his bouts of anger, stating that he genuinely respected [the mother] and described her as a “good mum.”  phasis added) [the father] reported that he had commenced personal counselling with a view to addressing his aggressive verbal outbursts during times of anger, stating words to the effect that "it is time i grew up.'' in addition to attending personal counselling, [the father] may benefit from attending a changing abusive behaviours program. this service may be accessed at ... this may assist him in gaining insight into the impact of his long-standing verbal, and emotional abuse may have had upon [the mother] (and [the child]). during his interview, [the father] claimed he was adamantly opposed to physical violence against women, however, he may benefit from some education into the harm verbal and emotional abuse can have upon his victim's physical, emotional and psychological health. while [the father] concedes that although he had threatened [the mother] with harm, he claimed that he never had, and would never, physically harm her or act on his threatening behaviours towards her. he recalled one incident where he pushed [the mother] on a bed on occasion when she attempted to hit him over the head with a bottle of-wine when she was heavily intoxicated. during her interview, [the mother] indicated that she did not recall this incident, and [the father] responded that it was likely she would not remember this incident given her level of intoxication at the time.
... it appears as if [the mother] has struggled with drinking alcohol to excess over many years as vic road documents reveal that this issue was first raised in 2010, again in 2013 and further in 2017. while it is concerning that [the child] has been living in primary care of her mother while she had struggled with excessive alcohol consumption, it appears as if [the mother] has primarily lived with family members or [the father] who have been secondary parental figures for [the child] and have assisted in her daily care. it is strongly suggested that [the mother] engages in drug & alcohol assessment and treatment, which can be accessed through [details of service]. ... both parents report that [the child] is a happy and healthy little girl who shares a positive and affectionate relationship with both of her parents. during [the child]'s observation sessions, both parents demonstrated their ability to remain child-focused, and [the child] lavished the attentions from both these significant parental figures in her life. other than the concerns mentioned above regarding [the child]'s expression of family violence and [the mother]'s ongoing concerns of alcohol dependence, neither parent identified safety concerns for [the child] in the care of the other parent. during their interviews, both parents praised the other as a parent for [the child].
... recommendations: on the basis of this assessment and unless there is additional information presented to the contrary, it is respectfully recommended that, 126. the issue of parental responsibility for [the child] as determined by the court. 127. [the child] live primary with her mother. [the father] continues to attend upon his personal counselling for a period of 12 months. [the father] participates in a men's behavioural change program and the authority is given for his counsellor/facilitator to engage with [the mother] to share her accounts of his family violence towards her if she chooses to do so. [the mother] participates in drug and alcohol assessment and counselling facilitated through ]the service] (or another equivalent service if she is no longer residing in [city c]). in the event [the mother] is permitted to relocate to queensland with [the child], that [the child] spends time with her father for four (4) consecutive nights each month in [city c] and that provision is made for [the child] to spend additional weekend or holiday time with her father in queensland if this is able to be accommodated. in the event [the child] and [the mother] remain living in [city c], that consideration is given to [the child] spending time with her father each alternate weekend from the conclusion of childcare friday until the commencement of childcare monday and in the alternate week from the conclusion of childcare wednesday until the commencement of childcare thursday (if this could be accommodated through her current childcare centre in 2020). that where possible, all handover's occur through [the child]'s childcare or future school, or otherwise facilitated through extended family members. the parents use a parenting application such as family wizard or another equivalent method to communicate regarding [the child]’s health and well-being.  e father] presented as a calm and engaging man who spoke openly about the parents’ relationship and his relationship with [the child].

when the mother sought to negotiate in temperate terms about the fact that the child care issue had to be dealt with and could not be ignored the father responded in vile, demeaning and sexualised terms.

why is [the child] going to suffer when you have the money to pay for it? why do you not want to pay for your child. it’s about being a parent

the child impact report (cir)
... [the father] denied any forms of physical violence towards [the mother], and explained the context of breaching the ivo in june 2021 as being the result of an “argument after my sister [died]” and [the mother] “didn’t get her own way”. [the father] acknowledged that he does not always react well to [the mother], and needs to find better strategies when responding to her but stated that “she knows how to push my buttons”. he reported that in the lead up to the beach of ivo, both he and [the mother] were seeing and interacting with each other frequently, and he feels she only reported the breach to the police when he refused to give her money. [the father] was challenged about the abusive and threatening nature of the text messages sent to [the mother] that led to the ivo being breached. he minimised the seriousness of the numerous threats to kill and harm her stating “it’s just the way the way i talk” and “i would never follow through on the threats”. he also expressed frustration that his messages were taken out of context, and that [the mother]’s content beforehand had not been provided to the court. [the father] denied that this is his ongoing style of communication with [the mother], and stated that they rarely argue in person as they have not been in a relationship for a number of years. he stated all their arguments are through text message and felt that both he and [the mother] had been emotionally abusive and hostile to one another via text message over the years. when questioned about family violence allegations made by [the mother], [the father] became visibly angry and called her a “fucken liar”. the writer informed [the father] that abusive and derogatory langue would not be acceptable, and he apologised and settled in his demeanour quickly. [the father] denied a pattern of family violence by him in previous relationships and explained his view that ivo’s are readily handed out with minimal evidence, and that his ex-partner used ivo’s to keep him away from his son, in a similar fashion he feels [the mother] has done with [the child]. [the father] denied having access to weapons or ever making [the mother] and [the child] feel unsafe. ... [the mother] acknowledged to having issues with alcohol in the past, where she used it as a “bad coping mechanism” to address her emotional pain relating to her experience of the alleged family violence. she also reported that she would consume alcohol to self-medicate her chronic pain issues, related to a birth defect with her [body], which she has struggled with her whole life. [the mother] advised that she sought help through drug and alcohol services and has not had any issue with alcohol for over two years. she reported that she now only drinks occasionally and in small amounts. [the mother] explained that she previously took numerous pain relief medications prescribed by her specialists, to manage the chronic pain associated to her hip problems, and the surgeries she required. she stated that both surgeries have been completed, and she no longer requires or takes any pain medications. ... [the father] presented as being heightened, agitated and at times angry throughout the assessment. while it is clear he loves [the child] and wishes to have a relationship with her, his ability to understand and focus on her needs was not evident during the assessment. [the father] was consistently focused on his ill feelings toward [the mother] and his perception that the court continues to favour her narrative and ignore the skewed perception towards him. at times he was unable to contain his anger about court systems and [the mother], and he was unable and unwilling to hear feedback presented to him, becoming angry and defensive when information was provided. [the father] minimised the family violence, and a clear pattern of behaviour towards [the mother] and previous partners, despite the collateral information. while he acknowledged some abusive language and an inappropriate response in his text messages towards [the mother], he minimised the seriousness of the threats and continues to blame other parties for his reactions, without demonstrating any accountability for his own actions and behaviour. [the father] was unable to identify or understand how his actions and involvement in the alleged family violence have been a parenting choice by him that has impacted [the child] and [the mother] as her primary carer. [the father] was also minimising and inconsistent with details related to his substance use, and was unable to demonstrate an understanding of how this may impact his parenting, or [the child]’s safety and wellbeing in his care. despite wanting to spend time with [the child], [the father]’s refusal to accommodate this in a safe manner with supervised time demonstrates his reluctance to work towards developing a safe and meaningful relationship with her. key considerations and opportunities for resolution given the level of risk to [the child] has been identified during the assessment, it is not recommended that this matter proceed to a drc pathway. in addition, [the father] has expressed his desire to withdraw his involvement and not attend future court hearings, and he is unwilling to have supervised spend time with [the child] or seek professional support for his issues that have been identified during the assessment. given the nature and pattern of the alleged family violence and [the child]’s age, there is increased risk and vulnerability for her. therefore, it is recommended that consideration be given to appointing an icl. while it is important for [the child] to have a meaningful relationship with her father, it is imperative that her time spent with [the father] is physically and emotionally safe for her. as such, the court may wish to take a very cautious pathway with regards to [the father]’s spend time with [the child] until he is able to seek out professional support and assessment regarding the alleged family violence, drug use and possible mental health issues. consideration to be given to sole parental responsibility for [the mother] and supervised spend time contingent on [the father] undertaking the aforementioned programs. prior to the introduction of spend time, it would be beneficial for [the father to] undergo hair follicle drug testing, and a forensic risk and psychiatric assessment around the family violence and possible mental health issues. it would be beneficial to the court if this assessment focus on how these issues for [the father] may impact on his parenting and [the child]’s safety and wellbeing. it may be of benefit for the assessor to have a copy of this report. should the matter remain unresolved, the court may wish to consider a family report. prior to a family report taking place it would beneficial for the court to have access to police records, psychiatric assessments, and reports from any of the professionals working with the parents.
mr allen: ... you’ve heard, though, the evidence from [ms f] yesterday and she was quite adamant that you needed to attend to certain things in regard to your anger issues, and - - - ? the father: yes. but i – like, my challenge with this is, and this is the only reason i would agree to a new report, the report that was done was at a very, very, very challenging time in my life with my sister. i had accidently killed my dog at the time. i had newspaper articles about me. i had, obviously, these charges were brought against me. a lot of things had happened in a three month period where i was extremely angry about a lot of things, not just these proceedings. the report writer i found to be very aggressive towards me from the onset. like, the initial first question that was asked to me during that thing was straightaway about a rape allegation. it had nothing to do with [the child]. there was, probably, honestly only three or four questions that involved [the child]. the rest of it was – even as she said, when i called [the mother], “a fucking liar” to the domestic violence allegations, i did not say that. that was purely and strictly to [the mother’s] sexual assault allegation. the report writer didn’t – me and her had quite a discussion and it wasn’t a good discussion, and she did not favour anything that i had to say and even my acknowledgement of my wrongdoing, she still failed to put that into the report, and i – it didn’t end very well with me and the report writer, and i find it a very biased report at a very challenging time in my life. anybody in – any human would have the emotions that i was having at the time considering the things that were going on. so yes. my fuse probably was very short at the time of that questioning and she was very aggressive towards me. she was very demanding, and i was trying to explain that my relationship with my daughter is – well, i mean, it’s everything, really, and she doesn’t – she wouldn’t really accept that which she states in the report. but then, my daughter agrees with my statements and then they still followed through with the report that they should carry little weight, and that’s how i know that the report is, you know, nothing for me at all.
b. the father left this hearing prematurely and in a heightened state of emotion.
the final hearing
his honour: ... at paragraph 41 of ... [the] 14 november 2019 report, it had that:
[mr conan] presented as a calm and engaging man who spoke openly about his parents’ relationship and his relationship with [the child].
his honour: and that’s, on one view, a very different presentation to how you presented to [ms f], the cir report writer] and how you presented in your evidence when you were being challenged and being asked questions before me ... one thing that crosses my mind is that your anger has got worse, or your ability to control it has got worse, since [the 2019 family report writer] saw you..., not better? the father: it had, yes. but covid was a very challenging time, obviously, when you get locked in your house, and ... as [dr e] said, prior to covid i dealt with ... my anger and my stuff through just working seven days a week, going to the gym, hanging out with my friends, so basically it was a big block-out and it became more manageable because i was so busy i never had time to think about it. once covid happened and we all just got locked up in our own houses, i got stuck with my own thoughts, my own childhood trauma, and everything came back up, which is why i had engaged with a psychiatrist at the time, to work out strategies of why these triggers had come back now. and he said the same thing: i was no longer as busy as i was, i couldn’t go to the gym, i couldn’t socialise with my friends, i was stuck in my house with my own thoughts, which brought up all the trauma, and then, as that stuff progressed, then my sister committed suicide. i had accidentally killed my dog on a job site and ... it just got progressively worse over about a year and a half until i had – well, you could pretty much say breaking point. but now that this stuff is all open with my psychologist and it’s out there and we are discussing it, it is becoming a lot easier to manage. but, basically, i had ignored it for 33 years through working, starting the business, you know...
applicable law
standard of proof   in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account:   the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.
credit of the parties ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events...  tations omitted)  ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (“carlson”) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case:  5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... [169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide.  ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to.

mr allen: if the court was to order – if the court and the court may not do this – if the court was to order that your time with [the child]be supervised, first of all, would you attend for such supervised time with [the child]? the father: no. i would not and i have my reasons for that. mr allen: no. i’m just asking. and of course, that means that you would remain – if a supervision order was made, that means you would remain in queensland? the father: yes. mr allen: yes. because i think your evidence is that you would only return to victoria if it was to spend time with [the child] and that’s – i assume, is that spend time only if it’s on a 5/9 regime in terms of the old orders? the father: no. it was significant time. mr allen: okay? the father: i’m not coming down there for a telephone call and one supervised visit. mr allen: what do you describe as significant time? the father: i would like to see significant time go from, say, one to two facetime’s in an off week, to every second weekend with a progression to where the 2020 orders were prior to these proceedings. mr allen: yes. and in fairness, that’s what was – your counsel and in one of your documents, you acknowledge there needs to be a re-introduction of time but you do want to get to the 5/9. in what kind of timeframe are you looking about? the father: well, based on with – now, this is a totally different – based on with my son, when i hadn’t had anything – like, i didn’t even know he existed until he was four. that was, say, over a six month process. mr allen: okay. all right? the father: and that did not involve supervised time. that was just a couple of hours on a sunday, at [location h], for a month or so and then it progressed to – so it progressed from there, but it was a quite quick progression to every second weekend, yes.
