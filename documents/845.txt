orders sought by the wife
submissions on behalf of the wife
nature of an undefended hearing  for the purposes of rule 10.27 an applicant is in default if the applicant fails:   to comply with an order of the court in the proceeding. (b) file and serve a document required under these rules. (c) produce a document as required by division 6.2.2. (d) do any act required to be done by these rules. (e) prosecute the proceeding with due diligence.
legal principles  the anz home loan had been overdrawn by more than $8,000. the wife deposes that she was unaware that the facility had been overdrawn as she had been meeting her share of the repayments to the husband for him to pay the loan down. the wife is unaware as to where her contributions were then applied, (2) the unpaid council rates totalled $7,000 as at 2018, (3) unpaid water and gas bills totalling $3,000 as at 2018, (4) a joint anz credit card which was “maxed out” with a balance of $8,000, and (5) a cba credit card in the wife’s name but which was used by the husband which was “maxed out” with a balance of $5,000.
it will be recalled that section 79(2) provides that “[t]the court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. section 79(4) prescribes matters that must be taken into account in considering what order (if any) should be made under the section. the requirements of the two subsections are not to be conflated. in every case in which a property settlement order under section 79 is sought it is necessary to satisfy the court that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. the expression “just and equitable” is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[12]
in many cases where an application is made for property settlement the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as a result of the choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife. no less importantly the express and implicit assumptions that underpin the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be affected consensually as needed or desired is brought to an end. hence, it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying section 79(4).[14]
as a result of those matters, the court’s approach to s 79/s 90sm may be less compartmentalised than what a strict or unthinking adherence to four (or three) “steps” might otherwise reveal. the task is essentially holistic, is it just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the particular relationship or marriage under consideration to make an order and, if so, its terms must similarly meet that criteria. of course, holistic though the approach is, it must be referenced to what the act requires and care must be taken to ensure that the court’s reasons make that clear. (see, for example, davut & raif [1994] famca 113, (1994) flc 92-503 at 81,237). [17]
contributions & needs
revised asset pool
in matters such as this one cannot approach the problem with an eye for meticulous detail. it should rather be dealt with broadly so that the end result can be said to be just and equitable.[20]
conclusion
