agreed she had stated in her amended initiating application filed 30 may 2022 that the parties commenced living together in 2004 and that she had not sought to correct that to a different date. the significance of this is that she stated in her affidavit that the relationship had commenced in 2001,[5] (b) was shown the bank q account statements disclosed by the husband and directed to the transaction for 3 may 2021.[6] it was then put to her that the entry shows a deposit to the account for the sale proceeds of the camper, such that it has been accounted for in the balance included for that account at $99,839. the joint balance sheet subsequently submitted by the parties reflects a “nil” amount for the camper and i infer that the wife now concedes the proceeds of sale have been properly accounted for, (c) conceded that it would be far better if one party retained the former matrimonial home and that she had provided no evidence to the court about the reasons she should retain it, (d) conceded that the husband owned the former matrimonial home since 1990 and uses it for his work and business, but her explanatory evidence conveyed that she claimed the husband could conduct the business and store equipment, freezers, work equipment, etc at his property at b street, town c in (“the b street, town c property”), (e) was uninclined to accept the suggestion that the former matrimonial home was an ideal and necessary property for use as the base for the husband as a farmer conducting his business, (f) suggested that the husband could use his property at town t for his work equipment when based out of the region u, and that the travel required with work equipment and gear to operate from town t was not a consideration as he travelled with them already, (g) agreed, concerning the husband’s spending during the relationship, that they each had their own incomes and bank accounts. further, she agreed that she and her children moved into the former matrimonial home and made it their home, which was an indirect contribution by him to the children’s support. however, she said that she paid for the children’s regular expenses, (h) agreed that the husband had paid the mortgage and rates on the former matrimonial home until 2010 and was solely responsible for the mortgage until 2013, but said she had paid into the bank q account prior to 2013, (i) agreed she had calculated that, in the period december 2019 to 5 april 2021, she contributed $14,000 to the bank q account. however, she had not calculated what the husband contributed when it was suggested he contributed $51,000 in the same period, (j) when it was suggested that the $13,000 which she seeks to be added back in the scheme of things is not a lot, she stated it all needed to be taken into account. further, denied that the account was established for the husband’s business purpose, instead saying it was for saving and enabling a deposit for another property, (k) when it was suggested that the husband was only using the account for legitimate business expenditure and was not wasting money away, she stated that she had “not reviewed the statement closely”, but appeared to agree that the husband was not “whittling away funds” to outdo her in the property settlement, (l) provided fairly detailed evidence about how she had spent monies from the inheritance she received. essentially, she purchased appliances and furniture to set up a new residence following separation, paid legal fees, and assisted her daughter, (m) when cross-examined about the assertion that the husband was not exercising his earning capacity fully, or “running dead” the business, agreed that weather was a factor affecting his work and that his income historically fluctuated. however, she did not agree that the income reduction since separation was simply a reflection of normal market conditions. she said that she knew the husband was not doing as much as he could because her brother was his employee, (n) said she had not disputed the evidence of the joint expert valuer mr v (“the joint expert”) in the affidavit filed 26 september 2022, (o) agreed that the husband alone had bought a property at f street, town g (“the f street, town g property”), although they had first seen it together on a date in 2001. she agreed that the husband had owned it before they commenced living together, but stated that she had contributed to the mortgage on the property and was unsure when she commenced doing so as the husband managed the loans, and (p) agreed that after a period the husband had started paying her for work as an employee, but the evidence was not clear about when. this is contrary to that stated in her affidavit, which stated 2015.   was shown the bank q account
