reasons for judgment
evidence in the trial
the father kicking [c] in early 2021 has been a feature of this hearing. it appears that [c] was hurt at the time and that he and [d], who witnessed the incident, were troubled by it. it is most unfortunate that the father lost his temper and hurt one of his sons that way. i would also comment that i hope the mother has not continued to remind the children about this incident. it would be damaging for the boys emotionally for an unfortunate incident two years ago to be kept in their minds so that the relationship with the father cannot move on and improve.
... i asked [mr crowley] if his contact had affected what he hoped to gain from the program, provided example (sic) of increased understanding of dv with men identifying behaviours they want to work on that initially they didn’t think were an issue. [mr crowley] said he is learning a lot and what real abuse it (sic), learning about disrespectful, controlling and dominant behaviours and is seeing this is what is being used against him. (emphasis added).   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
