reasons for judgment

introduction
relevant legal principles
non-disclosure
notional add-backs ] the full court held in [ajo & gro] that addbacks fall into “three clear categories”: where the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and “waste” or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets. [28] however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever “a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation”, the full court describing such a proposition as “unduly simplistic”. an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is “the exception rather than the rule”. [29] the fundamental precept that addbacks are exceptional, reflected in the decisions just referred to, also mirrors what has been said in earlier decisions of the full court that, for example, “the family court must take the property of a party to the marriage as it finds it” at trial. an important parallel proposition is that the parties do not “go into a state of suspended economic animation” after separation. thus, reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback. [30] two fundamental premises emerge from [ajo & gro] and the authorities preceding it. first, “adding back” is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.  ] however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever “a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation”, the full court describing such a proposition as “unduly simplistic”. an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is “the exception rather than the rule”.

[101] the court also carefully considered the evidence of the respondent mother both orally and in documents tendered in evidence. the court has concerns as to the respondent mother’s statements that the applicant father was informed of her intention to relocate to [city jj]. a number of property issues relating to the ownership of [livestock] by [ms t], and the loan of machinery by the paternal grandmother to the applicant father as discussed below, which were put to the relevant witnesses could not be sustained. documents were produced supporting the ownership of the [livestock] by [ms t]. [102] the court has considerable concerns as to the denials by the respondent mother that she has sought to alienate the children from the applicant father. the court prefers the opinions of the writer of the cic memorandum and the writer of the family report. the court does not accept there has been a change of heart in this regard by the respondent mother. [103] the above concerns, as well as the issue of family violence discussed below, have caused the court to carefully scrutinise the respondent mother’s evidence, overall, and exercise some caution as to the overall credibility of her evidence and the weight that should be given to her evidence.  1] the court also carefully considered the evidence of the respondent mother both orally and in documents tendered in evidence. the court has concerns as to the respondent mother’s statements that the applicant father was informed of her intention to relocate to [city jj]. a number of property issues relating to the ownership of [livestock] by [ms t], and the loan of machinery by the paternal grandmother to the applicant father as discussed below, which were put to the relevant witnesses could not be sustained. documents were produced supporting the ownership of the [livestock] by [ms t].

issues of family violence  4] the respondent mother raised issues of family violence during the course of the marriage, including coercive and controlling behaviour by the applicant father towards the respondent mother and physical violence in respect of her and the children. there are also allegations of alcohol abuse in relation to the applicant father. [105] in relation to alcohol abuse, the respondent mother painted a picture of excessive alcohol usage on a nightly basis. the applicant father undertook a cdt test which provided a negative result. in the absence of any other evidence, the court is not prepared to accept the respondent mother’s allegations of alcohol abuse by the applicant father. contained within the applicant father’s tender bundle is a copy of the transcript of the defended hearing in relation to the respondent mother’s application for an advo. this hearing took place [in mid] 2018, a relatively short period after the party separated. [106] the local court magistrate noted that, under the relevant domestic violence legislation in new south wales, the court may, on application, make an apprehended violence order if it is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that the complainant has reasonable grounds to fear on behalf of herself and the children, as well as reasonable grounds to fear and in fact fears, noting however that in relation to the children it is not necessary for the court to be satisfied that the person for whose protection the order would be made, in fact, fears. [107] at point 40 on page 55 of the transcript, the learned magistrate states as follows “i must say that i found the statement of [ms franklyn] (the respondent mother) to be very general, lacking much substance”. at point 45 on page 57 of the transcript the, magistrate states as follows:  5] in relation to alcohol abuse, the respondent mother painted a picture of excessive alcohol usage on a nightly basis. the applicant father undertook a cdt test which provided a negative result. in the absence of any other evidence, the court is not prepared to accept the respondent mother’s allegations of alcohol abuse by the applicant father. contained within the applicant father’s tender bundle is a copy of the transcript of the defended hearing in relation to the respondent mother’s application for an advo. this hearing took place [in mid] 2018, a relatively short period after the party separated.

i am troubled by the evidence given by the complainant in these proceedings. i find there is a degree of exaggeration. i am not satisfied on the balance of probabilities that there are reasonable grounds to fear, though i do accept that the complainant actually fears whether or not there is some sort of or sense of paranoia or not, which may lead her belief that the defendant hired a [...] man with a backpack and a suit to walk around and follow her at various locations in [f town] or not. i don’t know but even if i was satisfied there are reasonable grounds to fear it is not a matter in my view that it is appropriate to make an apprehended violence order for the protection of the persons named in the complaint. 8] while this court must form its own view on the issue of family violence, this court is entitled to take into account the findings of the local court magistrate as set out above. the court notes that, as a result of the interim advo being issued, the applicant father’s firearms were seized from him. the applicant father no longer has access to any firearms and is unlikely to be able to obtain a firearms licence in the future. this mitigates against any fears the respondent mother may have in relation to the usage of firearms by the applicant father in an inappropriate manner. [109] the court notes that there is some evidence of complaints of family violence being made by the respondent mother in 2015 prior to the parties separating. this report was apparently made by a psychologist who saw the respondent mother about relationship issues during her pregnancy with [y]. [110] based on the totality of the evidence, including the independent evidence of the family consultant and the writer of the cic memorandum, together with the material set out above, the court is not satisfied that the applicant father poses a risk to either of the children and that there is a need to protect the children from being subjected to, or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence at the hands of the applicant father.  9] the court notes that there is some evidence of complaints of family violence being made by the respondent mother in 2015 prior to the parties separating. this report was apparently made by a psychologist who saw the respondent mother about relationship issues during her pregnancy with [y].

... s.60cc(3)(j) & (k): any family violence...  2] as discussed above, the court is not able to be satisfied, on the whole of the material, that there has been acts of family violence involving the children or the respondent mother, such that this consideration would need to be considered further than it has been discussed above
