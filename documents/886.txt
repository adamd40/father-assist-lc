section 60cc(3)(e)  firstly, the mother’s attitude towards the father has meant that for three years the child has been exposed to a household that is negative towards her dad and any role he may play in her life and there was no evidence that supervision (having failed in the past) would be capable of working in the future, (b) secondly, the mother’s alternate proposal is that she would return to live in nsw and that neither party would live more than 200km from town e. potentially this could see the mother living 200km away from town e and the father 200km in the other direction away in town e with the child expected to travel significant distances each alternate weekend to spend time with the father. even if the distance is simply approximately 200km in one direction (based on the father staying where he is), that means x potentially travelling several hours every second weekend which in my view is not a practical long-term reality for her to have to endure.   secondly, the mother’s alternate proposal is that she would return to live in nsw and that neither party would live more than 200km from town e. potentially this could see the mother living 200km away from town e and the father 200km in the other direction away in town e with the child expected to travel significant distances each alternate weekend to spend time with the father. even if the distance is simply approximately 200km in one direction (based on the father staying where he is), that means x potentially travelling several hours every second weekend which in my view is not a practical long-term reality for her to have to endure.

a return to the question of the benefit of a meaningful relationship  when she lived in the local region, and x lived with her and had been spending time with the father - the mother did not act in a manner which supported the promotion of her relationship with him and by way of example i note that she told the court that she could not recall speaking positively of the father, (b) when she lived in the local region, and x lived with her, she suspended x’s time with the father for about three months, then following mediation, she resumed time for a short period and then stopped it again unilaterally and since then (and despite orders of this court one of which was by consent), x has not been able to resume spending any meaningful time with the father for an extended period of time, (c) without a working memory of her father, x has become frightened of the father and this is due to the household in which she and the mother have lived, (d) when the mother moved away with x, nothing has changed in the dynamics between x and her relationship with the father, (e) there is no evidence to support that x’s relationship with the father would be promoted with a “spends time” regime or that the mother has the capacity to comply with such an order (irrespective of whether that time is supervised or not) and even if x were to attend, the court child expert’s view was that this would likely become an “agony” for x who is already attuned to the mother’s negative attitudes about her father and would have to somehow manage the internal conflict caused within her when she comes home but cannot speak freely about anything pleasant that may have occurred when she was with the father (described as “no permission” by the court child expert).   when she lived in the local

conclusion  x will benefit from having a meaningful relationship with both her parents, (b) the mother poses an unacceptable risk of emotional and/or psychological risk of harm to x due to inability to promote a meaningful relationship between x and the father and also because of her inability to manage x’s anxious attachment to her and x’s behaviours, (c) the mother has some limitations on her capacity to meet the cultural needs of x, (d) following an eight-week moratorium to enable the father to develop a relationship with x, regular term time and holiday time between x and the mother will ensure that she gets a balanced view of each parents’ household and ameliorates any negativity that may arise in the mother’s household. (e) again, subject to practicability, time on special occasions will be ordered.   the mother poses an unacceptable risk of emotional and/or psychological risk of harm to x due to inability to promote a meaningful relationship between x and the father and also because of her inability to manage x’s anxious attachment to her and x’s behaviours, (c) the mother has some limitations on her capacity to meet the cultural needs of x, (d) following an eight-week moratorium to enable the father to develop a relationship with x, regular term time and holiday time between x and the mother will ensure that she gets a balanced view of each parents’ household and ameliorates any negativity that may arise in the mother’s household.

the applicable law, analysis & conclusion – costs  the father is employed in primary industry, although whether he continues to be so employed will depend on x’s transition into his care. the mother is unemployed and is in receipt of commonwealth benefits which may well make her eligible for an exemption pursuant to legal aid policy. (b) the father has the financial support of ms ee and the mother lives rent-free and in more recent times sold a property for approximately $1,000,000 million. (c) the mother was unsuccessful whereas the father’s relief was largely adopted by the court.   the father has the financial support of ms ee and the mother lives rent-free and in more recent times sold a property for approximately $1,000,000 million.
