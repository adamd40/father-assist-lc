background
documents relied on
the arguments  there are allegations made by the husband in his fvio application that are false. (b) she requires the release of the family law file in order to properly defend herself in the fvio proceedings. (c) she initially argued that to avoid having to bring a similar application in the future to this court, the court should grant the release from the harman undertaking in respect of any future proceedings before the parties in the magistrates court. however, during the hearing she conceded that this was too wide an ambit and agreed to contain her application to a release for the purposes of the current fvio proceedings. (d) with respect to the d commissioner complaint, she argues that on 12 december 2022, the d commissioner notified her of the matters still under investigation, and based on the contents of this communication, she seeks the release. (e) she argues that because the parties are before the court in several jurisdictions and her complaints relate to the conduct and honesty of the husband, she should not be required to identify every single document she seeks to have released from the harman undertaking.   she requires the release of the family law file in order to properly defend herself in the fvio proceedings.

personal bank accounts to divert more that $60,000 to herself without my prior knowledge or permission. the respondent has threatened to prosecute me for crimes i never committed, and has made groundless complaints to the ato, the [d commissioner], the victoria police, and other authorities, with the avowed purpose of having me jailed, or otherwise being found to be unfit to [work]. the respondent has relentlessly followed my movements by internet surveillance and discovered my private address. she has hacked into my work emails and purported to use private communications between me and my [colleagues in the course of my employment]. i have reported the family violence to police at [suburb o] station. the respondent has attempted suicide, hurt or tried to hurt themselves on purpose. incidents of family violence have increased. i am seeking an interim order for immediate protection. he applicant requires the release of the documents in their family law proceedings to counter the respondents conduct as a litigant who does whatever he wants without any regard to the truth, or the consequences that may arise. (as per the original)
the applicant is required to file a response to the respondents further and better particulars in case number [...] by 13 december 2022, and submits that to afford her natural justice and procedural fairness she requires the documents of the parties in their family law proceedings to defend herself against the repetitive, malicious, and serious allegations made by the respondent.

conclusions
... it means that i am not in a position to assess matters of the kind identified by wilcox j in springfield nominees (such as the nature of the document, the circumstances under which it came into existence, any prejudice the author might sustain, the nature of the information in the document and, most importantly, the likely contribution of the document to achieving justice in this proceeding.   the documents came into existence arising from an application to adjust interests in the matrimonial property. there must be special considerations that exist to justify their release. to consider these matters, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the nature of the information in the documents and the contribution it would make to achieving justice. i understand that some of the documents contained in the family law file might assist the d commissioner. however, i cannot be sure what those documents are and, accordingly, if i were to grant the release, i would be granting the release for over thousands of pages of documents contained in the family law file. (b) the authors of the documents are the parties, their legal representatives, and officers of this court. i need to consider any prejudice to the authors of those documents. the husband argued that he would suffer great prejudice due to the sheer volume of material over which the release from the undertaking is sought. he says that this will increase his legal costs. i accept that it will. (c) the court must give weight to whether the release is in the public interest. i am minded that the d commissioner plays an important role in regulating the conduct of the profession in victoria. they do this by investigating matters from the perspective of both consumer protection and upholding the rule of law. it is in the public interest that they be permitted to undertake their role both efficiently and without hindrance. but the provision of the whole family law file to them may not facilitate this. it might unnecessarily overwhelm and increase the workload of the complaint officer who has not made the request. accordingly, i am not satisfied that the wife has established that a release would likely contribute to achieving justice in the d commissioner complaint process.   the authors of the documents are the parties, their legal representatives, and officers of this court. i need to consider any prejudice to the authors of those documents. the husband argued that he would suffer great prejudice due to the sheer volume of material over which the release from the undertaking is sought. he says that this will increase his legal costs. i accept that it will.

(b) there are other more general allegations and i accept that some of them might have some relevance or connection to matters that were before the court in the family law proceedings. (c) the wife grounds her request for release on the basis that she “requires the release of the documents in [the] family law proceedings to counter the respondents conduct as a litigant who does whatever he wants without any regard to the truth, or the consequences that may arise.” (at paragraph 33 of the wife’s affidavit filed on 1 december 2022). (d) of note, the family law proceedings were resolved by way of consent orders in 2020 and no findings of fact were made. the only published judgment is that of judge kirton kc arising from the cross applications made by the parties for a release of the harman undertaking in june 2022. (e) the husband is opposed to any release of the implied undertaking for the fvio proceedings. he carefully took me through some of the documents referred to by the wife and argued that they would provide no assistance to the magistrates court. he concludes that no good reason has been shown for their release. (f) there is a distinction to be drawn in my view between legal proceedings or processes involving an agency such as the d commissioner or the ato, and legal proceedings where there is a commonality of parties (such as helicopter aerial) and here in the fvio proceedings. (g) this is also not the first fvio sought by the husband against the wife. there is therefore not insignificant commonality between the proceedings in the family law proceedings and in the fvio proceedings. the parties to each of the proceedings were and are the wife and the husband. the documents listed by the wife for release were all created for the purposes of litigation between the parties. (h) i am again left to weigh up the likely contribution of the entire family law file to achieving justice in the fvio proceedings. the parties have been in high conflict since at least 2019. it is an agreed fact that since 2020 the wife has made a range of complaints about the conduct of the husband to agencies such as the ato, the d commissioner and commenced proceedings in the federal court. the husband argues that the acrimonious conduct of the wife has gone much further, as set out in his reasons for seeking the fvio. this court is not asked to make findings on these matters, nor ought it do so. (i) it seems that the husband has chosen to use the fvio process as a vehicle through which he can hold the wife to account for the manner in which he alleges that she has conducted herself. it is arguably in the public interest that this process takes place with as much relevant material as possible so that the matter can be determined completely and with finality. while granting the release may prolong the length of the proceedings due to the volume of material that the wife will seek to rely upon, it is in the public interest that a decision is made with all of the material relevant to the allegations and assertions being put before the magistrates court. (j) i am also minded that s 166 of the family violence protection act 2008 (vic) contains restrictions on the publication of those proceedings, ensuring that the privacy of the parties will be preserved notwithstanding the release. (k) there must be special considerations that exist to justify the release of all of the documents listed by the wife. i understand that some of the documents contained in the file might assist the wife in defending the fvio, but i cannot be sure what those documents are and, accordingly, if i were to grant the release, i would be granting the release for over thousands of pages of documents contained in the court file. this could prolong the length of the fvio proceedings as well as the cost of them, and prejudice the husband. although, this is a matter that the magistrates court can manage and it does arise from the husband’s application. (l) the wife consistently has argued that the fvio proceedings will need to make findings based on credit – and critical to her defence will be her reliance on documents from the family law proceedings that demonstrate that the husband has made contradictory statements in various affidavits and material filed. this means the scope of documents extends to a broader range of documents such as orders and case summary documents. i consider that the documents from the family law proceedings and the historical context in which allegations of family violence have been made are relevant to the question of the husband’s credit and, consequently, the ability of the wife to defend the fvio. i am not, however, persuaded that any release should include, as indicated in order 2 of the wife’s minute of order: “... documents in the wife’s court book submitted to the court for the final hearing of the proceeding on 6 august 2020 that are referred to in: the wife’s affidavits filed on 4 february 2020, 24 february 2020 and 3 august 2020, and the notice to admit facts and authenticity of documents, filed by the wife on 10 february 2020.”   the wife has stolen $61,000 from him, and (ii) the wife hacked into the husband’s work emails and used private correspondence between him and his work colleagues for improper purposes.  ) the wife hacked into the husband’s work emails and used private correspondence between him and his work colleagues for improper purposes.   there are other more general allegations and i accept that some of them might have some relevance or connection to matters that were before the court in the family law proceedings.

in line with the authorities previously cited (such as asic v marshall) there is inadequate evidence before me to satisfy me of their potential importance to the fvio proceedings. i will however grant the release to a small category of documents.
