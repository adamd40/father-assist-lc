the husband  he worked in a voluntary capacity for 40 years at o company. he was unpaid, but they provided food and accommodation, (b) he then worked for two years in his business, but ceased that when he moved to town e due to purchasing that property in tasmania, (c) when asked why he did not resume his business, he stated that he did not know. it was put to him that he felt he did not need to work because he had the inheritance from which he had bought the town e property. he did not directly reply, but said he had about $30,000 left after buying the town e property, (d) he conceded that there were problems with the roof, water pipes and electrical work at the town e property when he bought it. however, the full effect of his evidence was that it was habitable and he was doing work gradually on the property to effect repairs. the tenor of his evidence was that the property was not in as dire a condition as conveyed by the wife, (e) he denied the wife had moved into live with him in late 2015, stating that she often stayed at the house earlier than that. he did concede that she moved in “full-time” in late 2015, (f) he maintained that the feeding of the animals was shared work, and that sometimes he did it alone and sometimes they both did it. later he maintained it was mainly he who did the work with the animals and said it was proportionally 60/40, (g) confusingly, he maintained that the caretaking was done when he fed the animals, but then said that the wife probably did most of it, (h) when challenged about evidence in his affidavit that he had “bought” hay bales, he eventually conceded it was purchased by the wife. however, he stated he did not believe she ever collected and moved the bales of hay, (i) when asked about the evidence that he had bought posts for fencing, again he agreed he did not pay for them and instead maintained he had collected them and helped mr g put every post into the ground. when the photo tendered as exhibit a-1 was put to him, he said that was only the first bulk batch of posts delivered and he later had to collect other posts, (j) regarding the animal stall, he maintained he had put in all the cross-bars onto the posts and hand dug the holes for the posts, except for a few which may have been pushed in with machinery by mr g. he specifically disputed that the wife had put the cross-bars on, (k) asked about the produce operation, he said he had initially harboured hope of resurrecting it, but it did not happen and only once had they got a crop from it. (l) he agreed that the wife had paid for the vet, care and food for the animals. he agreed that he would want it to be inferred that he was not interested in the animals, (m) he claimed that he received less from the superannuation pension established from his investment account through p company than he would have otherwise received from centrelink. he identified that he had been on a centrelink disability support pension which was about $450 per week, while the income stream was only $410 per week, (n) when played an interview about animals, he agreed he had done the interview and conceded eventually that he included himself in the reference to “[animal] people”. he agreed that the animals were his interest too for many years, but added it was not something he would action and agreed that was because he did not have the money to do so, (o) asked about his animal q, the husband’s evidence was to diminish his interest and claim in the animal, stating it was not at his instigation but went along with it to keep the wife happy, (p) he denied that he had instigated the purchase of the motor vehicle 5. however, he agreed that the wife had bought motor vehicle 5, motor vehicle 7, and motor vehicle 8 and had had also the recreational facilities installed, in part for his benefit, (q) he maintained that he did most of the domestic tasks around the home. he stated that the wife did only five to 10 per cent of cooking, and in five years he could not recall her vacuuming, but she did tidy the pantry as it was her desire for it to be organised, (r) he agreed that he did not bring in any cash assets other than a small amount of savings to the relationship, (s) when asked about his statement that the wife had taken all the funds from the inheritance at separation, he claimed ignorance of the arrangement whereby a sum of about $50,000 was given to him at the time the finances were separated, (t) cross-examination about this $50,000 was detailed and the husband had many opportunities to reconsider the reliability of his evidence, but did not do so. he left the court with the clear impression that he had to wait 12 months to be eligible for centrelink and had no money post-separation until he resumed receiving the disability pension, (u) he was tested about how he had produced annexure w01 to his affidavit and attributed values to the items of property he alleged the wife took or sold for herself. his evidence was vague, but eventually he accepted they were his estimates only rather than based on any particular knowledge or source, (v) he rejected the evidence of the wife about the state of disrepair of the town e property and stated the extent of work undertaken by the wife would not have been done by him and that he could have gradually done repairs and work himself as he had previously owned a maintenance company, (w) despite this, he accepted that he had been involved in choosing colours and layout of the kitchen and had been content for the work that had been undertaken because the wife wanted it, (x) he denied the value of the town e property had tripled, but agreed after some pressing that it was now valued at two and a half times the price for which he had bought it. however, he stated that he did not agree the reasons for the increase, (y) he had not recently looked for properties that he may purchase if the town e property had to be sold, because lately he “had been in a mess”. however, he stated that he sees what properties are worth and that he would need to spend at least $500,000, and for that price would not get a property as good as the town e property, (z) he agreed that the town e property is 20 hectares and has a house with four bedrooms. it was suggested to the husband that he could purchase suitable smaller housing which he would be better able to manage due to his health issues. when shown documents revealing searches on a real estate website,[9] he accepted the search results and what they revealed, but stated he would not want to live in the four examples given, (aa) the husband conceded that the wife has spent in excess of $600,000 “in connection with us”, but said he did not ask her to do so, (bb) a fact sheet and information from the r authority[10] were put to the husband. he agreed the town e property was zoned “rural” and accepted that subdivision was only permissible as a discretionary use because there were minimum lot sizes required for subdivision of rural land.   he then worked for two years in his business, but ceased that when he moved to town e due to purchasing that property in tasmania, (c) when asked why he did not resume his business, he stated that he did not know. it was put to him that he felt he did not need to work because he had the inheritance from which he had bought the town e property. he did not directly reply, but said he had about $30,000 left after buying the town e property, (d) he conceded that there were problems with the roof, water pipes and electrical work at the town e property when he bought it. however, the full effect of his evidence was that it was habitable and he was doing work gradually on the property

alleged the wife took or sold for herself. his evidence was vague, but eventually he accepted they were his estimates only rather than based on any particular knowledge or source, (v) he rejected the evidence of the wife about the state of disrepair of the town e property and stated the extent of work undertaken by the wife would not have been done by him and that he could have gradually done repairs and work himself as he had previously owned a maintenance company, (w) despite this, he accepted that he had been involved in choosing colours and layout of the kitchen and had been content for the work that had been undertaken because the wife wanted it, (x) he denied the value of the town e property had tripled, but agreed after some pressing that it was now valued at two and a half times the price for which he had bought it. however, he stated that he did not agree the reasons for the increase, (y) he had not recently looked for properties that he may purchase if the town e property had to be sold, because lately he “had been in a mess”. however, he stated that he sees what properties are worth and that he would need to spend at least $500,000, and for that price would not get a property as good as the town e property, (z) he agreed that the town e property is 20 hectares and has a house with four bedrooms. it was suggested to the husband that he could purchase suitable smaller housing which he would be better able to manage due to his health issues. when shown documents revealing searches on a real estate website,[9] he accepted the search results and what

her to do so, (bb) a fact sheet and information from the r authority[10] were put to the husband. he agreed the town e property was zoned “rural” and accepted that subdivision was only permissible as a discretionary use because there were minimum lot sizes required for subdivision of rural land.   when asked why he did not resume his business, he stated that he did not know. it was put to him that he felt he did not need to work because he had the inheritance from which he had bought the town e property. he did not directly reply, but said he had about $30,000 left after buying the town e property, (d) he conceded that there were problems with the roof, water pipes and electrical work at the town e property when he bought it. however, the full effect of his evidence was that it was habitable and he was doing work gradually on the property to effect repairs. the tenor of his evidence was that the property was not in as dire a condition as conveyed by the wife, (e) he denied the

had put in all the cross-bars onto the posts and hand dug the holes for the posts, except for a few which may have been pushed in with machinery by mr g. he specifically disputed that the wife had put the cross-bars on, (k) asked about the produce operation, he said he had initially harboured hope of resurrecting it, but it did not happen and only once had they got a crop from it.

received less from the superannuation pension established from his investment account through p company than he would have otherwise received from centrelink. he identified that he had been on a centrelink disability support pension which was about $450 per week, while the income stream was only $410 per week, (n) when played an interview about animals, he agreed he had done the interview and conceded eventually that he included himself in the reference to “[animal] people”. he agreed that the animals were his interest too for many years, but added it was not something he would action and agreed that was because he did not have the money to do so, (o) asked about his animal q, the husband’s evidence was to diminish his interest and claim in the animal, stating it was not at his instigation but went along with it to keep the wife happy, (p) he denied that he had instigated the purchase of the motor vehicle 5. however, he agreed that the wife had bought motor vehicle 5, motor vehicle 7, and motor vehicle 8 and had had also the recreational facilities installed, in part for his benefit, (q) he maintained that he did most of the domestic tasks around the home. he stated that the wife did only five to 10 per cent of cooking, and in five years he could not recall her vacuuming, but she did tidy the pantry as it was her desire for it to be organised, (r) he agreed that he did not bring in any cash assets other than a small amount of savings to the relationship, (s) when asked about his statement that the wife had taken all the funds from the inheritance at separation,

vehicle 7, and motor vehicle 8 and had had also the recreational facilities installed, in part for his benefit, (q) he maintained that he did most of the domestic tasks around the home. he stated that the wife did only five to 10 per cent of cooking, and in five years he could not recall her vacuuming, but she did tidy the pantry as it was her desire for it to be organised, (r) he agreed that he did not bring in any cash assets other than a small amount of savings to the relationship, (s) when asked about his statement that the wife had taken all the funds from the inheritance at separation, he claimed ignorance of the arrangement whereby a sum of about $50,000 was given to him at the time the finances were separated, (t) cross-examination about this $50,000 was detailed and the husband had many opportunities to reconsider the reliability of his evidence, but did not do so. he left the court with the clear impression that he had to wait 12 months to be eligible for centrelink and had no money post-separation until he resumed receiving the disability pension, (u) he was tested about how he had produced annexure w01 to his affidavit and attributed values to the items of property he alleged the wife took or sold for herself. his evidence was vague, but eventually he accepted they were his estimates only rather than based on any particular knowledge or source, (v) he rejected the evidence of the wife about the state of disrepair of the town e property and stated the extent of work undertaken by the wife would not have been done by him and that he could have gradually done repairs and work himself as he had previously owned a maintenance company, (w) despite this, he accepted that he had been involved in choosing colours and layout of the kitchen and had been content for the work that had been undertaken because the wife wanted it, (x) he denied the value of the town e property had tripled, but agreed after some pressing that it was now valued at two and a half times the price for which he had bought it. however, he stated that he did not agree the reasons for the increase, (y) he had not recently looked for properties that he may purchase if the town e property had to be sold, because lately he “had been in a mess”. however, he stated that he sees what properties are worth and that he would need to spend at least $500,000, and for that price would not get a property as good as the town e property, (z) he agreed that the town e property is 20 hectares and has a house with four bedrooms. it was suggested to the husband that he could purchase suitable smaller housing which he would be better able to manage due to his health issues. when shown documents revealing searches on a real estate website,[9] he accepted the search results and what they revealed, but stated he would not want to live in the four examples given, (aa) the husband conceded that the wife has spent in excess of $600,000 “in connection with us”, but said he did not ask her to do so, (bb) a fact sheet and information from the r authority[10] were put to the husband. he agreed the town e property was zoned “rural” and accepted that subdivision was only permissible as a discretionary use because there were minimum lot sizes required for subdivision of rural land.   when asked about the evidence that he had bought posts for fencing, again he agreed he did not pay for them and instead maintained he had collected them and helped mr g put every post into the ground. when the photo tendered as exhibit a-1 was put to him, he said that was only the first bulk batch of posts delivered and he later had to collect other posts, (j) regarding the animal stall, he maintained he had put in all the cross-bars onto the posts and hand dug the holes for the posts, except for a few which may have been pushed in with machinery by mr g. he specifically disputed that the wife had put the cross-bars on, (k) asked about the produce operation, he said he had initially harboured hope of resurrecting it, but it did not happen and only once had they got a crop from it. (l) he agreed that the wife had paid for the vet, care and food for the animals. he agreed that he would want it to be inferred that he was not interested in the animals, (m) he claimed that he received less from the superannuation pension established from his investment account through p company than he would have otherwise received from centrelink. he identified that he had been on a centrelink disability support pension which was about $450 per week, while the income stream was only $410 per week, (n) when played an interview about animals, he agreed he had done the interview and conceded eventually that he included himself in the reference to “[animal] people”. he agreed that the animals were his interest too for many years, but added it was not something he would action and agreed that was because he did not have the money to do so, (o) asked about his animal q, the husband’s evidence was to diminish his interest and claim in the animal, stating it was not at his instigation but went along with it to keep the wife happy, (p) he denied that he had instigated the purchase of the motor vehicle 5. however, he agreed that the wife had bought motor vehicle 5, motor vehicle 7, and motor vehicle 8 and had had also the recreational facilities installed, in part for his benefit, (q) he maintained that he did most of the domestic tasks around the home. he stated that the wife did only five to 10 per cent of cooking, and in five years he could not recall her vacuuming, but she did tidy the pantry as it was her desire for it to be organised, (r) he agreed that he did not bring in any cash assets other than a small amount of savings to the relationship, (s) when asked about his statement that the wife had taken all the funds from the inheritance at separation, he claimed ignorance of the arrangement whereby a sum of about $50,000 was given to him at the time the finances were separated, (t) cross-examination about this $50,000 was detailed and the husband had many opportunities to reconsider the reliability of his evidence, but did not do so. he left the court with the clear impression that he had to wait 12 months to be eligible for centrelink and had no money post-separation until he resumed receiving the disability pension, (u) he was tested about how he had produced annexure w01 to his affidavit and attributed values to the items of property he alleged the wife took or sold for herself. his evidence was vague, but eventually he accepted they were his estimates only rather than based on any particular knowledge or source, (v) he rejected the evidence of the wife about the state of disrepair of the town e property and stated the extent of work undertaken by the wife would not have been done by him and that he could have gradually done repairs and work himself as he had previously owned a maintenance company, (w) despite this, he accepted that he had been involved in choosing colours and layout of the kitchen and had been content for the work that had been undertaken because the wife wanted it, (x) he denied the value of the town e property had tripled, but agreed after some pressing that it was now valued at two and a half times the price for which he had bought it. however, he stated that he did not agree the reasons for the increase, (y) he had not recently looked for properties that he may purchase if the town e property had to be sold, because lately he “had been in a mess”. however, he stated that he sees what properties are worth and that he would need to spend at least $500,000, and for that price would not get a property as good as the town e property, (z) he agreed that the town e property is 20 hectares and has a house with four bedrooms. it was suggested to the husband that he could purchase suitable smaller housing which he would be better able to manage due to his health issues. when shown documents revealing searches on a real estate website,[9] he accepted the search results and what they revealed, but stated he would not want to live in the four examples given, (aa) the husband conceded that the wife has spent in excess of $600,000 “in connection with us”, but said he did not ask her to do so, (bb) a fact sheet and information from the r authority[10] were put to the husband. he agreed the town e property was zoned “rural” and accepted that subdivision was only permissible as a discretionary use because there were minimum lot sizes required for subdivision of rural land.   regarding the animal stall, he maintained he had put in all the cross-bars onto the posts and hand dug the holes for the posts, except for a few which may have been pushed in with machinery by mr g. he specifically disputed that the wife had put the cross-bars on, (k) asked about the produce operation, he said he had initially harboured hope of resurrecting it, but it did not happen and only once had they got a crop from it.

“adequately” is a relative concept which must be determined having regard to “a standard of living that is in all the circumstances reasonable (see sec. 75(2)(g) and ferguson and ferguson [1978] famca 70, (1978) flc 90-500”,   as to the meaning of “adequate” in the context of standard of living referred to in s 75(2)(g) of the act, the meaning in the shorter oxford dictionary applied, being “commensurate in fitness”, “sufficient”, “suitable”,[33] (h) no particular consideration in s 75(2) of the act has greater import than any other. thus, s 75(2)(g) is not “a guiding principle” for any assessment of the relevant s 75(2) factors, it is just one of the factors to be considered in the holistic assessment, albeit, it is open to a court to attribute appropriate weight to any of the factors taken into account. certainly, and in this case, a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable was an important factor favouring the husband, given his accommodation and living arrangements, and his honour referred to that issue and took it into account, bridges & bridges [2020] famcafc 77 at [66] (“bridges”),   no particular consideration in s 75(2) of the act has greater import than any other. thus, s 75(2)(g) is not “a guiding principle” for any assessment of the relevant s 75(2) factors, it is just one of the factors to be considered in the holistic assessment, albeit, it is open to a court to attribute appropriate weight to any of the factors taken into account. certainly, and in this case, a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable was an important factor favouring the husband, given his accommodation and living arrangements, and his honour referred to that issue and took it into account, bridges & bridges [2020] famcafc 77 at [66] (“bridges”),
on the evidence presented to me by two land agents, i am not satisfied that half the net proceeds would enable the wife to provide herself with accommodation which equates with the quality of the accommodation of dashwood road property and its surroundings. i am conscious that sec. 75(2)(g) does relate only to “a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable”, but having regard to the past circumstances of the parties, and their present financial circumstances, i am of the view that the wife is entitled to live in comfort in an area reasonably close to where she has established herself during the last 10 or more years of her life...

husband,[40] (c) they understate the value of the husband’s initial financial contributions, (d) they do not allow for the fact that of the inheritance $100,000 was paid to the wife’s superannuation

remain and this is undesirable and contrary to the object of the act, (b) the husband has elected not to engage a lawyer until very late in the piece and failed to explore all possibilities of
