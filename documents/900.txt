the evidence  loves [ms hagans] very much and they have a strong bond and close relationship. i think [ms hagans] is a really good mother to [x]. [x] speaks often and fondly about [mr d] and his daughters and i understand that [x] has a close and loving relationship with each of them. [x] has an extremely close and loving relationship with [ms hagans]’s parents who have assisted regularly with her care since she was born.   child support as set out in the agreement until june 2020 and thereafter paid child support as assessed, (b) one half of the child’s private health insurance premiums, (c) one third of the child’s net day-care costs, and (d) the child’s swimming lessons costs.   one half of the child’s private health insurance premiums, (c) one third of the child’s net day-care costs, and (d) the child’s swimming lessons costs.   one third of the child’s net day-care costs, and (d) the child’s swimming lessons costs.   the child’s swimming lessons costs.
at the time of hearing the child support assessment was $1103.33 per month.   the child spends time with the father during school term time each wednesday from the end of school until thursday the start of school, and (b) each alternate weekend from end of school on friday until start of school on monday or 3:00pm on monday if the monday is a public holiday, including the bank holiday, (c) for the first week of the school holidays at the end of terms 1, 2 and 3 from 9:00am on the first sunday of the school holidays until 9:00am on the following sunday, (d) during the school holidays at the end of term 4 from 9:00am on the first sunday until 9:00am on the following sunday and each alternate week thereafter, and (e) on special occasions at easter, christmas, on father’s day and on birthdays as defined in the orders.   each alternate weekend from end of school on friday until start of school on monday or 3:00pm on monday if the monday is a public holiday, including the bank holiday, (c) for the first week of the school holidays at the end of terms 1, 2 and 3 from 9:00am on the first sunday of the school holidays until 9:00am on the following sunday, (d) during the school holidays at the end of term 4 from 9:00am on the first sunday until 9:00am on the following sunday and each alternate week thereafter, and (e) on special occasions at easter, christmas, on father’s day and on birthdays as defined in the orders.   for the first week of the school holidays at the end of terms 1, 2 and 3 from 9:00am on the first sunday of the school holidays until 9:00am on the following sunday, (d) during the school holidays at the end of term 4 from 9:00am on the first sunday until 9:00am on the following sunday and each alternate week thereafter, and (e) on special occasions at easter, christmas, on father’s day and on birthdays as defined in the orders.   during the school holidays at the end of term 4 from 9:00am on the first sunday until 9:00am on the following sunday and each alternate week thereafter, and (e) on special occasions at easter, christmas, on father’s day and on birthdays as defined in the orders.   on special occasions at easter, christmas, on father’s day and on birthdays as defined in the orders.   continues to have disturbed sleep upon her return to me after spending time with [mr hagans], including crying, wetting the bed and acting out. i observed [x] comes home very tired from [mr hagans]’s house, and is often ‘out of sorts’. most of the time she is unsettled and does not sleep through the night often waking and requiring comfort and reassurance from me.
at no time have i stopped time for [x] to spend with [mr hagans] being increased on an incremental basis, but i have had issues relating to [mr hagans] wanting time increase much quicker than what i believe to be in [x]'s best interest. it has been my observations that [x] has coped well the [sic] gradually increase and change of schedules if the increase is very gradual and [x]'s best interests are considered.
the mother does not propose any increase in the child’s time with her father beyond that provided in the june 2020 interim orders and she does not provide evidence as to what she means by “gradual increase”.
...almost every day, always about what i believe were trivial aspects of his time with [x] such as what she had eaten, and did not focus on [x]'s emotional well-being, or how she was coping with all the changes.
the expert evidence of dr w
when asked about other family members that she did not live with, she [the child] told me about her dad. she looked to her mum when asked about him. when asked about the best thing about her dad, [x] responded: “not really anything. i love living with my mum most of all.” the worst thing about being with dad was “that i don’t get to see my mum often”. (paragraph 81) when asked if anyone lived with his [sic] with her dad, [x] responded: “no one else. well. his girlfriend.” she again looked to her mother. [x] was hesitant. she asked her mother, “mum. do i have to have to be in this conversation?” in response to her mother’s encouragement, [x] continued: “[ms b]. she’s got a baby. and nothing else.” she again asked her mother whether she had to be involved in this conversation. (paragraph 82) [x] identified a sad face. “i feel sad when i’m at my dad’s because i miss my mum, don’t i, mum?” (paragraph 86) [x] identified a worried face as weird and scared. she felt this way about thunderstorms. nothing else made her worried. she then [said (omitted)] to her mother, “do i ever get worried?” she denied that anyone in the family got worried. (paragraph 88) on the arrival of [mr hagans], [ms b] and the baby [v], [x] jumped into her father’s arms with the light. (paragraph 99) [x] chatted with her father about her activities and plans for school later in the day. ... [x] remained responsive, enthusiastic and playful. ... a positive engagement was observed between [x] and her father and [ms b]. (paragraph 100). when asked what made her feel happy, [x] responded: “that i’m with my dad.” (paragraph 103) a delightful rapport continued between the members of the paternal family. (paragraph 104)
after an extended period of play with her father [x] was asked about this experience. she told me it was good to see him. she also enjoyed seeing [ms b]. she told me that she enjoyed living with her mum and also enjoyed living with her dad, but when she lived with her mum she missed dad and when she was with her [dad – omitted] she missed her mum. when asked if she would like to spend more time with her dad, [x] responded, “i would like to spend both the same time because both of them are nice.” the report writer noted her initial response when told that her dad was coming when with her mother. [x] had put her hands over her ears and told the report writer that she wanted to be with her mum and not with her dad. [x] responded, “no. i did want to be with my dad.   firstly expressed the view that she would miss her mum should she spend more time with her dad. she expressed this in an emotive manner in an interaction with her mother. this was consistent with her close bond with her primary attachment figure. after the family observation with her dad, she expressed the view that she missed mum when with her dad and missed dad when with mum. she does wish to spend equal time with each parent. the mother asserted that she had been coached to say this by her dad. [x] denied that this was the case. the statements highlighted her mixed feelings about her predicament. (paragraph 167) a loving and secure relationship was identified between [x] and each of her parents. positive secondary relationships were observed with their respective partners. (paragraph 169) although [x] had adapted to the separation from her mother during her regular contact visits with her father, she continued to experience distress on leaving her care. this was despite her positive relationship with her father. this would be exacerbated by the father’s proposal [at the time of the report but not at final hearing] to transition to week about shared care over the next 12 months. this would not be in her best interests. she would benefit from the maintenance of the current contact arrangements ... (paragraph 171) both parents were identified to have the capacity to provide for the needs of the child, including physical, emotional, and intellectual needs. they were both well supported by their partners. (paragraph 175) [in relation to the father] – there was no evidence that his current parenting capacity was impaired due to his mental health or substance use. these factors were however relevant to the mother’s inability to trust him in a co-parenting relationship. there was a narcissistic flavour to his account. he lacked empathy for the mothers experience. (paragraph 179) the mother impressed as a reliable and caring parent, who prioritised her daughter’s needs contrary to the father’s view that she lacked emotional attunement. (paragraph 180) both parents demonstrated a loving attitude to the child, and a committed approach to the responsibilities of parenthood. they were both well supported by the respective partners. (paragraph 185) the parents demonstrated current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise. that said, there was a basic lack of trust in the relationship. (paragraph 189) there was no indication that either parent required further intervention. (paragraph 191) [x] will continue to benefit from the active involvement of both parents in her life. the maintenance of shared parental responsibility will assist to ensure that this is the case...she should attend a single general practice, with both parents involved in specialist referrals. (paragraph 193) [x] will benefit from the maintenance of the current care arrangements during her primary school years. once [x] commences high school, i would recommend that week-about shared care be established. (paragraph 195)
submissions
once [x] commences high school, i would recommend that week-about shared care be established.
whilst the father’s proposed final orders achieve a shared care arrangement, though not on a week about basis, from when she commences year 5, and then moves to a week about arrangement during school term when she commences year 7, it is a significant departure from the father’s original aim of achieving shared care within 12 months of final orders.

a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[6]

any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views.
the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child).
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, to spend time with the child, and to communicate with the child.
the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child.
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of her parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom she has been living.
the practical difficulty and expense of the child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect her right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis.
the capacity of each of the child’s parents, and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs.
the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant.
the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents.
