what are the views, needs and characteristics of the children?
...children [with behavioural issues] often make choices on how they feel in the moment and struggle to imagine that they may have a different perspective in the future, or that there may be irreversible consequences for choosing one course of action over another.[15]   x said she did not mind going to visit her father[16] particularly when he takes her shopping, and (b) y said he did not want to spend more time at his father’s home[17].   y said he did not want to spend more time at his father’s home[17].   x said that she thought it would perhaps be okay to see the father very occasionally for special occasions such as birthdays and christmas (if he brought gifts). x placed the father and ms e almost at the bottom of a notional “ladder with many rungs” with the top rung being the spot to identify person/s who make her feel “the best”, and each descending rung being spots to identify person/s who make her feel a little bit less good and finally the bottom rung being a spot for any person who makes her feel sad, angry or unsafe (‘the feelings ladder’), (b) y said that he never wanted to see or talk to his father again. y said that the last time he saw his father he “dropped me on the concrete and the grass”[18] and explained that having taken issue with the father talking badly of the mother, y ran and pushed the father who then picked him up until their faces were at the same height and “dropped” him to the ground, with his body landing on the concrete and his head landing on the grass. y said he was then sent to the garage before his mother collected him. y said that since, then the father had attempted to apologise via text messages, but said that an apology was not “going to cut it”. y was reported as being very angry with his father, not only because of the incident, but because he was aware that the father had told others that y had assaulted him first and also about other incidents as well. y identified his father and ms e on the bottom rung of the feelings ladder.

what are the parenting capacities of the parties?
what will be the impact of change upon the children?  if i adopt the proposal of the icl and the mother and accept the evidence of the experts about firstly the strong negative views held by at least two of the children and the inherent vulnerabilities that children with behavioural conditions bring to their views and expressions then without a future meeting with the father, what is the likely chance of the children ever wanting to spend time with him? and (b) viewed through the above prism, what is the impact on the children in changing their current lived experience by introducing regularised and specified long-term communication with their dad, without a reasonable prospect of actually meeting him in person to experience (perhaps) version 2.0 (to use my expressed vernacular during closing submissions)?   viewed through the above prism, what is the impact on the children in changing their current lived experience by introducing regularised and specified long-term communication with their dad, without a reasonable prospect of actually meeting him in person to experience (perhaps) version 2.0 (to use my expressed vernacular during closing submissions)?   to be mandated to continue working with ms l and the alcohol clinic and to enrol and complete a men’s behaviour change course, and (b) to only progress to unsupervised time after six (6) months’ of supervision and him successfully engaging in mental health and alcohol abuse services.   to only progress to unsupervised time after six (6) months’ of supervision and him successfully engaging in mental health and alcohol abuse services.   any alleged incapacity sought to be sheeted home to the mother in failing to support the relationship would at least at the first stage, need to withstand the supervisor’s record of the attempts made to have the children participate, and (b) despite the mother’s evidence of the children having expressed unwillingness prior to october 2022, and q’s view that if they don’t want to go the children won’t, the children have largely spent time with the father since these proceedings kicked off.   despite the mother’s evidence of the children having expressed unwillingness prior to october 2022, and q’s view that if they don’t want to go the children won’t, the children have largely spent time with the father since these proceedings kicked off.   what will be the effect or impact on the children of that circumstance (fairfield & hoffman [2021] famcafc 151 at [71]), and/or (b) whether it would be desirable to for that to occur (moose & moose (2008) flc 93-375 [moose & moose]).   whether it would be desirable to for that to occur (moose & moose (2008) flc 93-375 [moose & moose]).
what consideration should be given to the perpetration of family violence and what inferences should be drawn from the family violence orders?
is it preferable to make an order that reduces the prospect of further litigation about the children?  the father’s lack of insight into him being solely responsible for the violence he perpetrated on y, ms e and f, suggesting that he may have little insight and/or capacity to regulate himself in the face of controversy about any proposal for travel, and (b) the mother’s uncontested evidence about the violence experienced by the family and the father’s mental health vulnerabilities, and how that may adversely impact upon her ability to negotiate with the father about a desire to travel.   the mother’s uncontested evidence about the violence experienced by the family and the father’s mental health vulnerabilities, and how that may adversely impact upon her ability to negotiate with the father about a desire to travel.
are there any practical difficulties of the children spending time with the father and what is the effect of the parties’ proposals on the children moving forward?
with whom should the children live?
should the children spend time with the father and if so, how should this be facilitated?  the children have all been negatively impacted (to varying degrees) by their experiences in the sole care of the father, even with ms e living in the same house. ms p laid bare the children’s lived experience of their father and that the previously genuine and positive connection they had with their father when q saw them had been significantly damaged by events since. (b) the children have in the past benefitted from a meaningful relationship with the father reflected for example in x still expressing a desire to spend time (and keep connected) with the father this year and all parties agreeing that limited communication between the father and the children should occur. (c) the children’s capacity to think of the broader implications of their views about the time they spend with the father is impaired not only by their age and developmental stage but also by their behavioural issues diagnosis. as summarised by me, q said it would be commonplace for them to preference their relationship with their primary caregiver (the mother) over all others including the other parent (the father) without reflecting on the ramifications of those choices.[21] (d) the father has an impaired capacity to meet the emotional and psychological needs of the children not only because of his failure to meaningfully address his longstanding mental health issues and abusive relationship with alcohol (other than perhaps having just embarked or re-embarked on that journey this year), but also for example because there was no evidence that he has an understanding of children with neurodiversity and strategies to negotiate with egocentric headstrong neuro-diverse children[22] which was on full display in october 2022 in his inappropriate management of y (which arose out of y being exposed to negative comments about his primary carer).[23] (e) the mother has a deficit in her capacity to meet the emotional needs of the children (but nowhere near to the same level as the father’s) because it is apparent that at least y has been exposed to the parental conflict in some way such that y was aware of the father having taken a positive alcohol test. (f) the mother does have some capacity to quarantine her negative attitude about the father because otherwise, why would x express to ms p that despite all that has happened, she would still like to spend limited time with her dad?   the children have in the past benefitted from a meaningful relationship with the father reflected for example in x still expressing a desire to spend time (and keep connected) with the father this year and all parties agreeing that limited communication between the father and the children should occur.

(b) the development of a more positive experience of the father by the children (in a safe setting), rather than the realistic estrangement the children currently have with the father, which, given
