reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
background
brief chronology of the proceedings
upon provision of the documents referred to in paragraph two (2) herein: the parties and counsel properly instructed for mediation meet with [mr r] of [firm s] at their joint expense to receive advice as to any division 7a loan implications, and the parties and counsel properly instructed for trial participate in mediation with [mr t] of [u lawyers].
at an earlier stage of proceedings, the wife had filed affidavits from the following:
the value of the parties’ real propoerty
orders sought by the parties
this email is in relation to [ab street, suburb ac] sa that has been valued by [company m] at $650,000. our client has had dealings with [ad real estate] at [suburb ae] sa ([mr af] and [mr ag]) who have indicated that they have a buyer for [ab street, suburb ac] sa for that price. [mr manwaring] has instructed that he has no objections to the said property being sold. the proceeds can then be used to discharge the mortgage over that property. if the event there is a surplus then the funds are to be invested in joint names.[6]
division 7a tax
suffice to say there may be a contingent liability but i am unable to commence on the existence or quantum of any liability. in the event the loans are compliant, there is a potential exposure to “top up tax” in managing the loans. based on the available information, it seems to me that any such liability may not be substantial. advice from the external accountant may be required.[7]
as at 30 june 2018, mr j estimated the amount owing by the parties to the company as being $379,552.00.
applying an average marginal tax rate of 34.5% across all years, an estimate of the division 7a loan balances and potential tax payable of each balance being assess as a deemed unfranked dividend is: [8]

the issues & legal priniciples applicable
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[10]
what emerges from the authorities is that while there might be a “rule” the application of which is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, the manner in which a particular liability should be treated is, ultimately, dependent upon the nature of the liability, the circumstances surrounding the liability and the dictates of justice and equity shaped by each. the usual practice or “rule” sits comfortably and conformably within that rubric – in many cases, perhaps almost all, liabilities will be deducted from the “gross” value of the property because it will be clear (and even if not expressly stated, determined) that the justice and equity of the case demands that the liabilities should be met by the parties in the proportions in which the court determines the property is to be divided.
while some liabilities are charges upon the property which can be accurately assessed at a certain date, others are at large, or have not been precisely determined, e.g. tax liabilities. in some cases the amount of the liability can only be estimated generally. the court can make an allowance for a particular liability if appropriate to do so. in some cases there are sufficient uncertainties as to the alleged liability to lead the court to disregard it entirely or partly. in other cases, the court may take the view that because of the circumstances surrounding the incurring of the liability it ought in justice and equity to be wholly or partly disregarded in determining the appropriate order to make under sec. 79 as between the parties to the marriage. such a result could be reached where a spouse had incurred a liability in deliberate or reckless disregard of the other party’s potential entitlement under sec. 79
once a court proceeds to exercise the power in s 79 of the act, being in the substantive phase, a court is required to undertake consideration of the matters in section 79(4) including by reference to s 79(4)(e) the matters in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant. however consideration of such matters may be brief and if it is established that ‘it seems likely to the court that...the applicant...will be likely to receive by way of property settlement a sum sufficient to cover the advance, that would seem to be sufficient to enable the order sought to be made’.[22]
