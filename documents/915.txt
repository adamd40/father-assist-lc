issues that require consideration
“ the confirmed diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder for the two children and how this diagnosis impacts upon the capacity of the children in live with and spend time arrangements, the greater severity of autism spectrum disorder for [y] and the implications of this with respect to parenting arrangements, the suggestion that the mother has been spending weekend time with the subject children in the car, has stopped the time with the children early and has spent some of the time with only one of the children, which if true, raise concerns about the capacity of the mother to cope with the conjoint needs of the subject children, the mother’s current housing conditions and her current lack of practical housing for the subject children, despite her proposal for the subject children to live in her primary care, the mother’s lack of family or partner support with respect to caring for the subject children, there is a significant distance between the parties which does not support a shared care arrangement, whether the individual and differing needs of the children are able to be managed by single care giver, whether sole parental responsibility may be appropriate, given the ongoing health, psychological and educational needs of the children.”
issues for determination by the court  whether the children will live in an equal time arrangement with both parents or whether the children will continue to live with the father, (b) if the children continue to live with the father, the spend time arrangements for the children with the mother, (c) whether the mother will be restrained from bringing any other person to the time she spends with the children, unless with the prior approval of the father, (d) the allocation of parental responsibility for the children, (e) passport and international travel for the children, (f) whether the parents will be restrained from recording each other and the children or their nominee who collects and returns the children at changeover.   if the children continue to live with the father, the spend time arrangements for the children with the mother, (c) whether the mother will be restrained from bringing any other person to the time she spends with the children, unless with the prior approval of the father, (d) the allocation of parental responsibility for the children, (e) passport and international travel for the children, (f) whether the parents will be restrained from recording each other and the children or their nominee who collects and returns the children at changeover.   whether the mother will be restrained from bringing any other person to the time she spends with the children, unless with the prior approval of the father, (d) the allocation of parental responsibility for the children, (e) passport and international travel for the children, (f) whether the parents will be restrained from recording each other and the children or their nominee who collects and returns the children at changeover.   the allocation of parental responsibility for the children, (e) passport and international travel for the children, (f) whether the parents will be restrained from recording each other and the children or their nominee who collects and returns the children at changeover.   passport and international travel for the children, (f) whether the parents will be restrained from recording each other and the children or their nominee who collects and returns the children at changeover.   whether the parents will be restrained from recording each other and the children or their nominee who collects and returns the children at changeover.
primary considerations
section 60cc(2)(a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents
section 60cc(2)(b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse neglect of family violence
relevant additional considerations
section 60cc(3)(a): any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child's maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views
“[x] expressed a strong and firm wish to continue living with the father and the paternal grandparents. he regards this as his home. [x] reported he did not want to spend overnight time with the mother...he expressed apprehension about changing the current routine and expressed reservations about an unknown situation, which seems consistent with his current diagnosis. [x] was asked about spending an occasional night with the mother, given that this has occurred in the past, and [x] stated that he did not want this to occur...[x] wanted the judge to know that he wants to keep everything the same as it is now”.[24]
section 60cc(3)(b): the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents, and other persons (including any grandparents or other relative of the child)
section 60cc(3)(c): the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, and to spend time with the child, and to communicate with the child
“went straight from the airport to [mr mulroney’s] parents’ home in [city af]. when i arrived only [mr t] was home. i was still wearing my wedding ring and informed [mr t] that i wanted to see my boys and restore my marriage. [mr t] shouted at me and told me to go away. [mr mulroney] did not let me stay there. he said ‘once you get a place of your won you can spend more time with the children.’ i then arranged accommodation at a nearby hotel.”[34]
“if they are tired or we are at a venue that they don’t want to be (and i can’t take them elsewhere) and i think it is best for them to go home and rest, i let them do so. they are sensitive to light and noise and given that i have to meet them in a public place they are often impacted by this.”
appropriately, no party sought to criticise the mother for cutting short the children’s visits with her in order to meet the needs of the children.
section 60cc(3)(ca): the extent to which each of the child’s parents have fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligation to maintain the child
section 60cc(3)(d): the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of the child’s parents, or any other child or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living
section 60cc(3)(e): the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
section 60cc(3)(f): the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person to provide for the needs of the child including emotional and intellectual needs
“this was not easy for [ms mulroney] to accept, having very little understanding of [autism] and what it meant, and she had periods of extreme lows and distress whilst coming to terms of understanding the implications of this for herself and her sons.”
relevantly the mother’s doctor records that:
section 60cc(3)(g): the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant
section 60cc(3)(j) &(k): any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family, and if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order
section 60cc(3)(m): any other factor or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant  on 3 july 2017: “school in sydney help student with autisms anyway” and “i won’t look after boys too. i’m tired. yes sydney is better than country e”, (b) on 4 july 2017: “please i want to separate. but yes you come to city j.enjoy city j and go back to sydney with boys.” (c) on 4 september 2017: “you can take the boys. good education and medical over there. can enrol them in a good public school that have special needs teacher. it more open about autism and more support. here bully and crazy culture i’m sorry mr mulroney” (sic)   on 4 july 2017: “please i want to separate. but yes you come to city j.enjoy city j and go back to sydney with boys.” (c) on 4 september 2017: “you can take the boys. good education and medical over there. can enrol them in a good public school that have special needs teacher. it more open about autism and more support. here bully and crazy culture i’m sorry mr mulroney” (sic)   on 4 september 2017: “you can take the boys. good education and medical over there. can enrol them in a good public school that have special needs teacher. it more open about autism and more support. here bully and crazy culture i’m sorry mr mulroney” (sic)
