ex-tempore reasons for judgment

overview
facts / chronology
during our time at [suburb l] the father would have aggressive and physical outbursts towards me. the first time he had yelled, dragged me from the living area into the hallway, pinned me against the wall and continued to drag me into the bedroom where he threw me onto the bed. i was shaking and crying and told him to stop, i was so fearful i urinated on myself. he later apologised and said he did not know what came over himself and that he would never hurt me or do that to me again. i then consoled him and talked through his injury with him as this then became his defence and excuse for future incidences. the aggressive behaviour and physical outbursts continued to occur thereafter. i left after another incident and stayed at his mother's house for the night but did not tell her what had happened only that we had been fighting. i also tried to visit my mother and sister when i could however, the father stated he always needed me to be with him as his suppo1i and said he did not like to be left alone if i was not at work. the father made it clear to me that i was not to discuss our relationship as well as his injury to any of my friends, his family or my family as it was his business and his alone to tell and that i had no right to discuss private matters with anyone as they will judge him and not understand things the way i do. i obliged.[9]
it was around 06.00pm, the father and i were laying on the bed in my bedroom. i told the father i needed a nap because i was tired but he wanted to have sex. i continued to tell the father” no" and "i need a nap” when he turned me onto my back and came on top of me pinning me down onto the bed and said "why do you always say no to me!". i tried to push him off and told him to get off me. i got up and he grabbed and threw me back onto the bed and started punching the mattress next to my head and in doing so had made contact with my forehead. my sister and her two kids, [p] and [q] were also [...] downstairs. my sister heard me screaming and had come upstairs and knocked on the door to see what was going on. i opened the door and she saw my busted lip and bruise on my head. she yelled in shock "what happened? what did you do?". the father then got into a physical altercation with my sister, spitting at her. my nephews came upstairs and tried to get the father away from my sister, but he had hit and pushed them both. the father pushed both of the children. my sister called the police and the father was subsequently charged with assault. the police applied for an advo for my protection which also included my sister and her children.[17]
the father was physically abusive on many occasions during my pregnancy [...] we had an argument about how i should not be tired and that i did not do much for [x's] birthday. the father threw a pillow at me while holding [x] and when i got up had pushed me back down by my face. i tried to get back up and he reached towards my neck, but i held my hands out to back him off. we then got into another argument regarding cash that was missing from an envelope. he sta1ted swearing at me and i decided i wanted to leave and go to my mums with [x]. i started to pack bags and walked towards garage when he continued to swear at me and kicked my baby bag and in doing so kicked my leg and a baby bottle fell out. i went into the kitchen which is next to the garage and grabbed the thermos to pack. he put [x] down and said to me using words to the following effect: "what you want to hit me with that huh?" he stood over me in an intimidating way as i backed out of the kitchen towards the garage. i said using words to the following effect: "i'm packing it to take". i put my arms out to back him off. he then pushed me and pinned me up against sliding door [...]. i fought back trying to kick his testicles and pulling at his shirt. [x] had crawled or walked up behind him screaming as he continued to do so. he then pushed and dragged me by the neck into the bedroom, he threw me onto my back and onto the bed and continued to [hurt] me as i pulled and ripped his shirt and kicked at his lower region. he eventually let go and i pushed him back away from me. he told me to stop and grabbed my neck and threw me onto the bed again. i kicked him into the leg/ball area and sat up. he grabbed my hair and pulled my head down forwards towards the floor to kept me on the floor, he then stopped and went to [x] who was screaming. i felt severe pains and cramping in my lower abdomen and lower back similar to labour pains. i was most comfortable on my hands and knees as the pain would come and go. the father told me i was being dramatic and pushed me. he kept coming in and out of room. i did not want anything to do with him. i just breathed and screamed through the pain as it came, i started to get hot flashes and found it so painful to move. i eventually stood up, walked to the sink to cool down with cold water on my face and wrist. i ended up vomiting. i sat under bedroom fan with wet wrists and face to cool down. the father again attacked me during my pregnancy [...] i was cleaning out my wardrobe that night and the father was in the living room. when i was done, i had jackets to move from the wardrobe into the spare room located next to the living room. when i did so the father was laying on the sofa and asked if i could tum the lights off. i turned the lights off as i headed back to the bedroom. i decided to have a shower and left the tv and bedroom light on while doing so as i wanted to watch tv afterwards. when i finished the shower, the lights and tv were off and the father was in bed. i proceeded to turn the bedroom light on as i was heavily pregnant and could not see what i was doing in the dark. i turned the main light on while turning the bathroom light off so i could get dressed and do my night care routine. the father said to me using words to the following effect: "turn the light off i'm going to sleep". i responded using words to the following effect: "no i can't see i need to get dressed". he responded "turn the tv light on then". i said to him in response: "you knew i had to get dressed why did you turn eve1ything of]?". [x] started to cry so i quickly grabbed clothes to wear but had trouble putting them on quickly so just went [x] instead who went back to sleep immediately when i comforted her. when i returned to the bedroom, all the lights were off again so i walked in the dark back to the bedroom. i turned the light on and he got up and said to me using words to the following effect: "can't you turn the other light on?" i responded using words to the following effect: "well you knew i was coming back why did you turn all the lights off why didn't you leave that light on?" he then threw a pillow at me aggressively and it whipped my legs. i moved some of the pillows in his direction. he then sat up and pulled a fist at me and moved it in a motion toward my head. i said to him using words to the following effect: ''you were going to hit me". he denied it but i said to him using words to the following effect: "you put your hand into a fist position". he then grabbed me by the wrists and squeezed tightly. i grabbed his forearms in an attempt to get him to let go as he was hurting me. i scratched him in the process. he continued squeezing my wrist really hard at this point. he then pushed me back. i moved forward when he grabbed my face and then pushed me onto the bed. he then walked into the hallway and i was hysterically screaming at his point because he was acting like he wanted to kill me. he came back into the room, and i was up off the bed. he came closer to me and i thought he was going to hit me. i grabbed the hair straightener on the dresser in front of me and put my hand up in front of my head in a blocking motion. the edge of the straighter nicked the father's chin he then grabbed me again and threw me to the floor. he left to console [x] as she was awake and crying. when he returned, he said to me using words to the following effect: "look what you did to my chin". i responded using words to the following effect: "what about you? you started this all with your games with the lights and the pillows". he approached my face and mocked me and said using words to the following effect: "go on what are you going to do?" he spat in my face and walked out to [x]. i decided to get dressed and left the house to go for a drive in the car. i received a text message from him saying using the following words "don't come back or i'll call the police". i ended up parking at a park around the comer from our home. i decided to go back home as i wanted to be home with my daughter.[30]
i recall an incident in 2020, however, i cannot recall the exact month where the father had attacked me in front of [x] while i was holding [y] on the sofa. he had [hit] me multiple times in the abdomen and leg [...] after having thrown multiple household items at me [...]. he then proceeded to throw me around on the sofa while i held [y] and did not stop when i screamed at him "look at the baby! i'm holding the baby". during my attempt to call the police, the father had grabbed the phone off me and smashed it onto floor, stepped on and picked the same up and attempted to bend the phone.
i was crying over the counter and the father approached me and pushed me against the fridge. he said to me using word to the following effect: "what do you think you were going to fi1cking do with that? he then proceeds to put me face down onto the floor and put all his weight on me. i did not let go of the [weapon] as i now believed that he would hit me with the [weapon] if l gave it up. he then said using words to the following effect: "if you don’t let go i am going to break your shoulder". he had his knee into my arm and was twisting my elbow. i let go and he grabbed the [weapon] as my am1 felt like it was going to break. while still on me he said using words to the following effect: "you are a fucking idiot, did you really think you could do something like that to me?" he then proceeded [to hurt] my leg with the [weapon] and then let me go. after this happened the father gave me a band aid and said "i should call the police on you". the father would always twist his violent assaults on me somehow making out they were my fault, and he was the one that had been harmed. i was in shock and then said to me: ''you were in the wrong and need to apologise to me". i never lifted the [weapon] towards the father or directed the [weapon] towards him.[39]
the father started kicking my legs to get out of the room and i said using words to the following effect "what's wrong with you? i'm trying to help, look at you how frustrated you are? i'm not leaving this room until you do". he then got up and said to me using words to the following effect: "you are an ugly bitch and annoying cunt. you make everything worse". i said using words to the following effect: "why are you fighting me? i'm trying to defuse the situation". the father then mocked me and said: "ugly faced cunt" whilst walking out the door. i threw my phone in his direction which hit the hallway wall. i was upset by the father's continual denigration of me. the father then turned around staunched over me and i said: "what are you going to do, hit me?". the father pushed me against the dresser then dragged me to the other side of the room. he then grabbed me again and threw me on the armchair, then jumped on top of me, put both hands around my throat [...]. whilst [hurting] me he said using words to the following effect: "i'm going to fucking kill you bitch". [x] started screaming and crying which led to the father letting go". i was in pain and fell from the chair to the floor as my neck had wrapped around the arm rest. i sustained [injuries] as well as markings from the applicant's hands and fingernails during his attempt at [hurting] me. i had scratched the applicant's arm in my attempts at struggling to breath and trying to fight him off me. i was screaming and crying from the pain and the father responded using words to the following effect: "stop faking it and acting like a victim" he then pulled me up like a rag doll causing more pain to my neck. i eventually managed to get up and went to get [x]. i told him to leave the house.[40]
2. until further order and substitute of any time order benefitting the father, the father will spend the following time with the children, namely [x] born [...] 2019 and [y] born [...] 2020 as follows:
a. each alternate sunday from 9am until 2pm, b. each alternate saturday from 2pm until 4pm.
3.that the fathers time with the children be supervised by either of the paternal grandparents namely, [mr c] and [ms b].
current circumstances
documents to be relied upon and evidence
the applicant did not leave and was pacing back and forth on the front lawn, whilst having a cigarette against his car. my partner at the time arrived at the premises and as he got out of his vehicle the applicant approached him and took a swing at his head. he continued to attack him, and i ran out to try and stop it as my partner had an apparent head scan at the doctors just before. my eldest son them followed me as he was worried and by then, the applicant focused on me and trying to hurt me. my eldest son stood in front of me and then was being pushed and thrown around on the front lawn by the applicant. the applicant stopped suddenly as he saw my mother's vehicle pulling into the driveway. he continued to say 'fuck you [...], you're a coward" and got into his vehicle. shortly after the police arrived and took a video statement from my sister and was told not to contact the other party.[58]
these are very young children who are entirely dependent on their adult carer’s to protect them from harm and provide for their needs. what was reported about the children having a strong startle reflex, needing soothing to sleep, not talking and being sensitive to raised voices, indicates that these children have likely been traumatised by witnessing family violence. it is a matter of dispute as to whether one or both parents instigated this, but in either event, the family violence appears to have caused harm to the children and effected their development. when provided feedback on the children’s reported hypervigilance around noises being associated with their experiences of family violence, the parents both acknowledged this. the parents also acknowledged that, at the children’s very young ages, any increasing time they spend with [mr bannister] would need to be incremental.[59]
just based on the children’s current ages and developmental stages, the current spends time arrangements would be appropriate. however, if [mr bannister] is found to have perpetrated family violence as alleged, if that is the case, then it may not be in the children’s best interests to spend time with him at all (including supervised time).[60]
matters agreed
issues for determination
issue 1: should the father be consulted in relation to major long term decisions impacting the children, although, giving the mother the final say as to any decision made?
issue 2: should there be a move for the father from supervised time to unsupervised time (including overnight time) with children?
parenting orders: the law
unacceptable risk
the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children’s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[70]
standard of proof
the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.
the child/children’s best interests
the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of the children’s parents (s 60cc(2)(a))
what these definitions convey is that "meaningful", when used in the context of "meaningful relationship", is synonymous with "significant" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for "important" or "of consequence". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[74] a ‘meaningful relationship’ does not, however, have to be an ‘optimal relationship’. kay j’s remarks in godfrey & sanders more fully state this position: it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[75]
the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence (s 60cc(2)(b))  bannister] confirmed that there is a current advo protecting [ms kroll] from him and there are associated charges [...]. he said that these matters are currently before the criminal courts and he is pleading not guilty. [mr bannister] also confirmed that he plead guilty to assaulting [ms kroll] in 2018 and received a good behaviour bond. he advised that he remains on waiting lists for a men’s behaviour change program. [mr bannister] said that he has not instigated physical violence, but has retaliated physically to [ms kroll’s] violence towards him, and there have been injuries to both of them. he said that they were both verbally abusive, and arguments escalated to threats. [mr bannister] reported that the children witnessed verbal abuse and physical violence. he denied being controlling towards [ms kroll] and said that she was controlling of him, and would say that she would not feed the children until he got home, meaning that they would be “starving”.[79]
before turning to the wife’s evidence in this respect, it is desirable to say something about the corroboration of family violence. it is well settled that a party does not require their evidence of family violence to be corroborated before such evidence can be accepted. given the tendency of domestic violence to occur in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage and perhaps their children, this must necessarily be so: see keating & keating [2019] famcafc 46, (2019) flc 93-894 at [42] (ainslie-wallace and ryan jj) (“keating”), hendy & penningh [2018] famcafc 257, (2018) flc 93-879 at [72] (ainslie-wallace, ryan & austin jj), amador & amador [2009] famcafc 196, (2009) 43 fam lr 268 at [79] (may, coleman & le poer trench jj) (“amador”). whilst as a general principle it is important to identify a core consistency in the evidence of an alleged victim of family violence rather than concentrating on supposed inconsistencies in the evidence, this does not permit a court to ignore or otherwise dismiss inconsistencies in that evidence: keating at [62] (austin j), zuen & lhao [2020] famcafc 84 at [22]- [24] (ryan, aldridge and stevenson jj) (“zuen & lhao”). however the reference to the importance of identifying a core consistency, while important in cases involving family violence, must not obscure the reality that there cannot be a finding of family violence otherwise than in accordance with s 140 of the evidence act and having regard to all relevant matters: see amador at [86]-[93]. where allegations of family violence are made it is necessary for the court to make findings where the evidence enables that to be done: see zuen & lhao at [24].[82]
currently he lives with his mother having moved back about four months ago. it seems that his irritability made for a lot of tension with his partner. h would “go into rages — get physically violent — smoke a lot — drink a lot.”[88]  oss of libido coupled with majiuanna and [medication] use. his current presentation seems broadly consistent with a major depressive disorder and prominent anxiety and a combined substance use disorder (marijuana and [medication])[89]
“all evidence is to be weighed according to the poof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other side to have contradicted.”[94]
“can be confident about drawing inferences against a party who has chosen not to give evidence [if] it was within the power of the party to produce evidence on that matter.”[95]
the “rule in jones v dunkel” relates to the potential for an adverse inference to be drawn in circumstances where evidence presented in a case raises an inference against a party and that party is in a position to give or call evidence to refute it and does not do so. but, the “rule in jones v dunkel” can be seen as “a particular application” of “the rule in blatch v archer”. (see ho v powell [2001] nswca 168 per hodgson ja at [15], beazley ja agreeing). the latter “... applies where a person bearing the onus of proof does not give or call evidence which that person is plainly in a position to give or call, and unless some explanation is given of that failure, the tribunal of fact is entitled to infer that this evidence would not have assisted that person’s case ...” (ho v powell). the principle in blatch v archer can be seen as wider than the “rule in jones v dunkel” “because it is also available against the person bearing the onus of proof where that person does not adduce evidence that he or she was plainly in a position to adduce”. (australian securities and investments commission v rich [2009] nswsc 1229 per austin j at [439].”[96]  he failure of a party who bears an onus of proof to call an available witness who could cast light on some matter in dispute can be taken into account in deciding whether that onus is discharged, in circumstances where such evidence as has been called does not itself clearly discharge the onus.” [97]
but the future likelihood of that event occurring needs to be evaluated not only in terms of the cogency of the evidence that it has occurred in the past, but also in the context of the father’s denials and the vigilance of the parties, given the events that have led them to litigate over these issues so early in the child’s life. what potential there was for these events to continue to occur if they had previously occurred in the past, might well be diminished by the bright lights that have been shone upon the parties and their conduct, in the course of these proceedings.[99] (emphasis added)   the father has finished the men’s behaviour change course, (b) he maintains ongoing therapy with his psychologist, (c) his psychologist has all of the information relating to his past violence and his mental health and substance abuse issues, (d) he has day only time each week, and (e) he contacts at least one of his parents after the children have been in his care for two hours so as to confirm that he is stable, sober and well adjusted.   he maintains ongoing therapy with his psychologist, (c) his psychologist has all of the information relating to his past violence and his mental health and substance abuse issues, (d) he has day only time each week, and (e) he contacts at least one of his parents after the children have been in his care for two hours so as to confirm that he is stable, sober and well adjusted.   his psychologist has all of the information relating to his past violence and his mental health and substance abuse issues, (d) he has day only time each week, and (e) he contacts at least one of his parents after the children have been in his care for two hours so as to confirm that he is stable, sober and well adjusted.   he has day only time each week, and (e) he contacts at least one of his parents after the children have been in his care for two hours so as to confirm that he is stable, sober and well adjusted.   he contacts at least one of his parents after the children have been in his care for two hours so as to confirm that he is stable, sober and well adjusted.
any views expressed by the children, and the weight to be afforded to those views given their age and level of maturity (s 60cc(3)(a))
the terms of s 60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child’s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child’s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child’s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court to these matters.[100]
the nature of the relationship of the children with each of their parents and any other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the children) (s 60cc(3)(b))
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the children (s 60cc(3)(c))
the extent to which each of the children’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the children (s 60cc(3)(ca))
the likely effect of any changes in the children’s circumstances, including the likely effect to the children from any separation from either of their parents or any other child with whom they have been living (s 60cc(3)(d))
the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with a parent, and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the children’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis (s 60cc(3)(e))
the capacity of each of the children’s parents to provide for the needs of the children, including emotional and intellectual needs (s 60cc(3)(f))
the attitude to the children and the responsibilities of parenthood demonstrated by each of the parents (s 60cc(3)(i))
i generally received notification the friday night prior to the weekend visit of any cancellations. when i have requested a reason for cancellation by text message, i receive no response. when i have requested in person a reason for cancellation the paternal grandparents respond with "we don't know, you will have to ask [mr bannister] about that". the consistent amount of last-minute cancellations makes it very difficult to engage the girls in social events or to plan my weekend with the girls. we have missed friend's birthday and gatherings due to the lack of courtesy in notifying me of upcoming visits. the cancelled visit, sunday the 24th july 2022, the father had alternatively spent his time with his girlfriend, [ms bb], eating out and shopping.[103]
any family violence involving the children or a member of the children’s family (s 60cc(3)(j))
if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the children or a member of the children’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any evidence admitted in proceedings for the order, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter (s 60cc(3)(k))
whether it would be preferable to make orders that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the children (s 60cc(3)(l))
any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant (s 60cc(3)(m))
parental responsibility  this section applies if, under a parenting order:   2 or more persons are to share parental responsibility for a child, and (b) the exercise of that parental responsibility involves making a decision about a major long-term issue in relation to the child.   the order is taken to require the decision to be made jointly by those persons. (3) the order is taken to require each of those persons:   to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and (b) to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue.   to avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons that the decision has been made jointly.
... issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about:   the child's education (both current and future), and (b) the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent.
... (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, ...   parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children,   parents should agree about the future parenting of their children,   when making a parenting order in relation to a child, the court must apply a presumption that it is in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. (2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in:   abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent’s family (or that other person’s family), or (b) family violence.
... (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child’s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child.
applicability of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in this case 61da(2)] does not say that, if there are reasonable grounds to believe one of the nominated circumstances exists, equal shared parental responsibility, qualified or unqualified, shall not be ordered, but merely that the presumption does not apply (at all).[112]
equal time or substantial and significant time?
conclusion
the central task of determining parenting orders in a child’s best interests is not an exercise in searching for disqualifying factors in either parent. recognising that each person is unique, inevitably with strengths and weaknesses, both as a person and as a parent, the inquiry is essentially to determine parenting orders that will positively promote the child’s best interests in the context of that child’s actual circumstances, including any perceived parenting weakness of either or both of the child’s parents. parental conduct is relevant only to the extent that it informs the assessment of parenting capacity or otherwise has weight in the determination of the parenting orders in the child’s best interests, having regard to the considerations expressed in s 60cc of the act, which the court must consider in determining parenting orders in the best interests of the child. in this context, it is worth noting that in jurss & jurss [1976] famca 20, (1976) flc 90-041, a case decided not long after the act, in its original form, came into effect, demack j noted in respect of a then “custody” dispute that the court’s inquiry is essentially a positive one designed to promote the interests of the child, not to demote the claims of either parent. given that the overriding consideration for this court is best interests, the court must consider the conduct of parents not with a view to punishing such conduct or to reward one parent and punish the other, but to ascertain from such conduct, to the extent to which it is relevant, where the best interests of the subject child or children will be served from now or into the future.
the icl’s costs
the law as to costs is well settled. section 117 of the family law act 1975 (cth) (“the act”) provides that, subject to certain qualifications, each party to proceedings shall bear his or her own costs. section 117(2) provides that if the court is of the opinion that there are circumstances justifying it in doing so, the court may make such order as to costs as the court considers just. the relevant considerations in relation to an order for costs are set out in s 117(2a). the matters relevant to determining what order, if any, should be made for costs are set out in subsection (2a) of that section. they are the following:   the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, (b) whether any party has legal aid and the terms of any grant of aid, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answers, questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant.
section 117(3) provides:
to avoid doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children’s lawyer in respect of the proceedings.
section 117(4) provides:   however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if:  a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer,
the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children's lawyer.
section 117(5) provides:
in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2) in proceedings in which an independent children’s lawyer has been appointed, the court must disregard the fact that the independent children’s lawyer is funded under a legal aid scheme or service established under a commonwealth, state or territory law or approved by the attorney-general.
a question arises as to the actual meaning of the legislative intent for the court to “disregard the legal aid funding” of the independent children’s lawyer, because that terminology is susceptible to ambiguity. as opined by austin j in gahen & gahen (no 2) [2013] famca 936, it could conceivably mean either:   the independent children's lawyer should be presumed to be unfunded, so as to generally incline the court to order the parties’ contribution to the independent children's lawyer’s costs, or (b) the court should not be swayed by either the presumed ampleness or scarcity of the independent children's lawyer’s legal aid funding when determining whether to order the parties’ contribution to the independent children’s lawyer’s costs.
in de roma & de roma [2013] famca 566 watts j explained why the former is the preferred connotation, since the purposes of the legislative provision was to protect the public purse. the threshold presumption as to each party bearing their own costs has no application to the independent children’s lawyer, who is not a party. the law is well settled, however, that there is power under the section, subject to other statutory provisions referred to below, to make orders for or against the independent children’s lawyer and the court may make such order as to costs of the independent children’s lawyer and in such proportions in relation to each of the parties as the court considers just: (de roma & de roma (supra)).[113]
