evidence
affidavit of the father
me: “i am going to go to my mum’s” [ms daffney]: “you’re not going nowhere” me: “i’m going because this is going to end in us arguing”   daffney] continued to palm me in the face. i grabbed both of her arms and held them above her head so that she would stop. [ms daffney] then kneed me in the leg. ... i took [x] to the car and buckled him in when [ms daffney] started ripping at my shirt. [ms daffney] tried to take [x] out of the car so i locked the door. i then unlocked the driver’s side door, got in the car and went to my mother’s.
affidavit of the mother
... from february 2022, [x] began year two at a new school, [r school]. i did not inform [mr fairfield] of the change. despite this, i have seen [mr fairfield] driving his car past [x]’s new school, and i see [mr fairfield] driving along the main road to the school at pick-up and drop-off. i am unsure how [mr fairfield] discovered [x] was attending his new school. i am constantly frightened that [mr fairfield] will go to [x]’s school and take [x] away and i fear [mr fairfield] will follow us to discover our address.
... i have attempted to assist [x]’s academic progress by reading with him and doing mathematics activities daily. however, he struggles with focus and attention and would rather play video games. i have attended parenting classes specific to [x]’s age and special needs. i continue to read literature as i am determined to understand better how to support his learning and development. [mr fairfield] has never accompanied [x] to his paediatrician appointments and has little to no knowledge of his special needs.
... i do not want [mr fairfield] to be a part of our lives because i am afraid of him and how memories of his conduct and the possibility of future violent behaviour will affect the children. [mr fairfield]’s behaviour has had a catastrophic effect on [d], from which i fear she will never recover. [mr fairfield]’s conduct toward [d] has also significantly impacted [x]’s life. [x] has sensed [d]’s distress, and this negatively affects him. ... i am concerned that [mr fairfield] poses a serious risk to [x], given his propensity for physical violence and aggression, heavy drinking, risk-taking behaviours such as drunk driving, his inability to respect boundaries, and because he has been charged with sexually abusing and assaulting [x]’s older sister. ... to my knowledge, [mr fairfield] does not have his own home and lives with his mother, sister, and brother in his mother’s house at [suburb l]. if [x] were to stay overnight, there would be nowhere for him to sleep. [mr fairfield] and i do not have adequate communication to support equal shared parental responsibility, and we have never co-operated in caring for [x] on an ongoing basis. other than when [x] was a newborn baby, [mr fairfield] has been largely disinterested in his well-being and has had minimal involvement in his care. [mr fairfield] is unfamiliar with [x]’s special needs and has never taken him to a doctor’s appointment. furthermore, as detailed previously, [mr fairfield] is subject to an avo that restrains him from being within 100 metres of where [d] lives and, therefore, cannot approach our home. i am seeking sole parental responsibility for [x] and for him to continue living with me. i believe that this would be in [x]’s best interests as his odd and adhd necessitate a stable routine and home environment. further, [mr fairfield] is unaware of [x]’s special needs and any health issues beyond his dermatitis and has never demonstrated a capacity to maintain [x]’s long-term well-being. i believe [mr fairfield] poses a danger to [x] given his heavy drinking, aggression, inability to understand and address [x]’s needs, and his sexual abuse of [x]’s older sister [d]. as such, i believe it is in [x]’s best interests to have no contact with his father, as this is the only way to mitigate the risk of physical harm, sexual abuse and psychological harm.   has made measured progress since starting kindergarten. during the weeks of remote learning there was pleasing evidence of his participation in the home learning tasks. [x] displays highly anxious behaviour which results in unsettled and defiant behaviour in class, although, usually improved throughout the day. he is reluctant to participate in learning activities and requires significant teacher support for most learning tasks. [x] is developing his social skills and strategies to assist him in dealing with a variety of social situations. he is learning to work cooperatively with others. [x] needs to be reminded to look after his belongings.by putting them back in his school bag.

the single expert report
... ... [ms daffney] said she felt she was “walking on eggshells” as she never knew what mood [mr fairfield] would be in, or when he would “explode”. she said that when they did argue, he would “just walk out” rather than take steps to attempt to resolve any disagreements. however, she noted that he tended to “walk away, but after he’d already blown up”. according to [ms daffney], [mr fairfield] would “sometimes blow up at the kids as well”. she said that [g] has described a time that [mr fairfield] picked him up from the car and threw them on the lounge (this is referred to in [g]’s police statement, dated 12/03/2020). ... ... [ms daffney] alleged that when [mr fairfield] was [x]’s primary carer, she would sometimes return home from work to find that [x] had faeces in his nappy and had not been changed all day. she said that when [mr fairfield] left the family home, she had to toilet train [x], which she thought [mr fairfield] should have done as [x]’s primary carer. [ms daffney] said she was working almost every day at that point.
... [ms daffney] said that she noticed that [x] had behavioural issues when he was at day care. he was reportedly biting and doing “naughty little things”. however, [ms daffney] attributed this to “the terrible twos”. when he started kindergarten in 2020, however, she noticed that he had learning difficulties. [ms daffney] said that [mr fairfield] had left the family and she had more responsibility for [x]’s care, whereas [mr fairfield] had previously spent more time with him. she said that she noticed it took [x] a long time to do certain tasks, he cried often, his “whinging would turn into a nightmare”. she said she struggled to understand “why it was so hard for him to do a simple thing”. [ms daffney] said that she took [x] to a paediatrician and has sought support through the school. she said that [x] had a counsellor who attended his school, but during the covid lockdown this changed, and she is not sure whether this is still occurring. i asked who organised this and [ms daffney] did not know. ... according to [ms daffney], [x] has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and oppositional defiant disorder (odd), but she has not been provided with documentation confirming this. ... the subpoenaed notes from [dr f], consultant paediatrician, contain two reports (dated 11/08/2020 and 10/11/2020) which do not confirm any diagnoses for [x]. at the second appointment, on 10/11/2020, [dr f] prescribed medication for adhd, although he indicated the need for ongoing assessment in relation to adhd. at the third appointment on 5/01/2021, [dr f] noted that [x] had not been taking medication as prescribed, he had started wearing nappies to manage bedwetting, which was not recommended, and neither [ms daffney] nor [x]’s teachers had completed the adhd assessment questionnaires. the remainder of the notes available refer to medication changes and note limited observed changes in [x]’s behaviour. the [q school] notes contain a report by a speech pathologist, dated 27/07/2020, which indicates that [x] would benefit from some speech pathology support, but the overriding issue appeared to be anxiety. the [q school] records refer consistently to challenging behaviours by [x] in kindergarten, along with queries regarding anxiety, asd, and defiance. [ms daffney] described [x] as a “lost little child”, becoming teary when reflecting on his range of difficulties. she noted that he has tried numerous medications to manage adhd over the past two years, but nothing has been effective. she said that he has high anxiety. ... [ms daffney] spoke positively about being a parent. she said she loves spending time with her children. she described her role as a parent as to guide and nurture her children. [ms daffney] described [d] and [g] positively. she said [d] loves dancing and working in her new job. she said [d] can be “a bit of a drama queen at times, but she does have a very lovely heart, she’s very considerate”. she noted that despite all she has been through, she can still laugh and “see the better side of the world”. she described [g] as quiet on first meeting, but once he is comfortable, he is funny. she described him as thoughtful and loving, and focused on his family. [ms daffney]’s description of [x] was less positive. she noted that he is “quite independent”, that he likes to laugh and cuddle with his family sometimes, but paused and said: “i don’t know how to take him at times. i don’t know what’s going on his head sometimes”. she then spoke about the difficulties she has managing his behaviour, and reflected on him being “scared of the smallest things”. he reportedly wets the bed at times. my impression was that [ms daffney] feels overwhelmed at present with managing [x]’s behaviour and she agreed with this assessment. it appears that [ms daffney]’s focus on [x]’s challenging behaviour is currently precluding her from enjoying her relationship and time with him. [ms daffney] said that she has a good bond with each of her children, although each bond is slightly different. she thinks she spends equal time with each of the children and reassures them that she loves them equally. she noted that her bond with [d] is possibly stronger than with the boys, but attributed this to [d] being older, and them having had more time together because of her age. [ms daffney] reported no involvement with dcj and she has not participated in any parenting programs. ... [ms daffney] outlined appropriate routines for the children. she noted that she has worked hard on routines with her mother and sister so that the children understand the routine and are prepared for the day. [ms daffney] said that when [mr fairfield] lived with the family, she would often have the children in bed before he got home, but that he came home late from work and woke them, so he would have to resettle them. [ms daffney] said that the children do not use devices on school days, but they can watch television after dinner. they also have dessert at times, although she said that she has had to make changes to the dessert to manage [x]’s behaviour. previously, the children could have chocolate or chips, along with apple juice, cordial or coke zero. now, they can have fruit and water, although [ms daffney] tries to limit [x]’s liquid intake after dinner so he does not wet the bed. she noted that she is trying to limit his sugar and sweets in the evenings due to his adhd, however, her description of his previous evening sugar intake is of concern given his young age and the associated health impacts, regardless of his mental health functioning. [ms daffney] said the boys go to bed around 9pm and [d] is normally in bed at 10pm. [ms daffney] expressed her concern that if [mr fairfield] were to have time with [x], he would negatively impact the routine she has implemented with [x]. [ms daffney] said that [mr fairfield] is important in [x]’s life, as he “needs a father-figure in his life”, but she is concerned that the negative impacts on [x] of having time with his father would outweigh any positive effects. [ms daffney] believes that [x] having time with his father would negatively impact [d] in particular, although she suggested that both [d] and [g] would probably ignore the fact that [x] was seeing his father. she noted that neither [d] nor [g] mention [mr fairfield], and neither does [x]. however, she added: “i guess i don’t ask him how he’s feeling”. [ms daffney] acknowledged that it is “not fair” that [x] has no contact with his extended paternal family, but she added that they have not contacted her to seek time with [x]. she said if they did ask to see [x], she would have to think about this and how to manage it given that she could not take [d] and [g]. she said [x] has not asked about his extended family members, since saying that he did not want to see his paternal grandmother because she is “scary”. [ms daffney] said she would not trust [mr fairfield]’s mother to spend unsupervised time with [x] as she worries she would take him to see [mr fairfield].
... ... [mr fairfield] said his primary strength as a parent is that he was “always there for the kids” in terms of practical needs, but also offering emotional support. in terms of weaknesses, he spoke about his inability to provide financial and material stability. ... he said he typically removed privileges as discipline, or sent them to their room. [mr fairfield] said [x] was sent to his room more often than [g], but that both boys “were pretty good most of the time”. he acknowledged giving [x] “a light tap” when he broke an expensive television, which reflected his own upbringing. [mr fairfield] acknowledged that the children had no routine when he was living with the family. he said that there was conflict between him and [ms daffney] in relation to “which parent was going to tell the kids they had to go to bed”. he added: “i think we both weren’t capable of yelling at the kids to go to bed”. ... [mr fairfield] said that if [x] was spending time with him on weekends, they would spend time socialising and engaging in fun activities. he noted that he has not seen [x] in two years, so he would likely “spoil” him. he suggested an appropriate bedtime for [x] is 9:30-10pm on a weekend. ... ... [mr fairfield] suggested that [ms daffney] is a good mother overall and he has no significant concerns about her parenting. [mr fairfield] believes that [x] is being negatively impacted by his lack of contact with him, but was not sure how. ...
... ... [g] recalled positive and negative aspects of [mr fairfield], describing him as a “kind of fun and sometimes yelling dad”. ... summary: my impression from the interviews with the children is that there is no set routine for the children at home, that [d] assumes a parental role in relation to her younger brothers, and that [ms daffney] is currently overwhelmed and struggling to cope. overall, the bulk of information from my assessment, observations, review of documentation and collateral information suggests that [ms daffney] in fact has struggled for a long time to manage her behaviour and becomes dysregulated, resulting in verbally and physically aggressive outbursts towards the children. it appears that [mr fairfield] engaged in similarly verbally and physically aggressive conduct towards the children, although he also offered some protection and fun.
... ... ms ae (of [e mental health service]) said she is currently attempting to arrange ongoing support for [x] with a paediatrician and a child mental health service, although she had limited information about these referrals. she said she is waiting for [ms daffney] to provide signed consent to commence this process. she is also hoping to refer [ms daffney] to counselling for dv and a support group for parents of children with adhd. [ms ae] advised that her service has had no child protection concerns regarding the family. my impression, however, is that the service’s engagement has been limited and likely ineffective given that [x] is a child with complex needs who is unlikely to make meaningful progress in individual sessions without parental involvement alongside a multidisciplinary treating team.
a) the benefits of children having relationships with their parents is largely dependent on those parents being able to offer a meaningful and rewarding relationship to their children. this includes parents being able to prioritise their children’s needs, and to support their children’s developing sense of self and sense of belonging. broadly speaking, the more loving, protective adults a child has in their life, the greater their chances of developing a stable, positive sense of self, and long-term psychological health.
[ms daffney] is currently overwhelmed and under-supported and she is struggling with self-regulation. ... [ms daffney] has struggled to manage [x]’s challenging behaviours. despite this, [ms daffney] is [x]’s primary caregiver and while i hold concerns about her parenting capacity, these are not at a level that currently outweighs the benefits of [x] having a relationship with his mother. there would be significant risks to [x] of a disruption to his relationship with his mother, particularly in terms of his psychological functioning and sense of self. it appears that [mr fairfield] has also demonstrated dysregulation in the past as a parent. the allegations of abuse of [d] suggest that [mr fairfield] has failed to prioritise [d]’s needs above his own, and this raises concern that he may do the same in his relationship with [x]. while [mr fairfield] spoke appropriately about [x] and it is clear that he misses his son, i hold concern that the risks of [mr fairfield] having a relationship with [x] currently outweigh the benefits. if [x] were to have time with his father, this would create significant instability in the family home, particularly in relation to (a) [ms daffney]’s capacity to manage that time and any associated behavioural changes in [x] and (b) the potential impact on [x]’s relationship with his siblings. ...
... d) my views regarding the abuse allegations have been outlined in the body of this report. it is my impression that [mr fairfield] likely did sexually abuse [d]. i have conducted a risk assessment detailed above and note that while [mr fairfield] falls within a low-risk category for sexual recidivism, this does not factor in the risk of psychological harm that may be caused to the children if [x] were to have contact with his father. i am particularly concerned about the impact on the sibling relationships if [x] were to be spending time with his father. while [mr fairfield]’s alleged sexual abuse of [d] is a relevant factor in this matter, it is not the sole factor that i place weight on in my determination that time with his father is currently not in [x]’s best interests. e) ... i suspect that [x] would like to have a relationship with his father based solely on the information from [d] [g] and [d]. however, for this to occur, [x] and the family will require significant support and this is likely to be a long-term consideration. f) ... [x]’s needs appear to be met by [d] and the other adults in the household as well as by his mother.

f) ... [x]’s needs appear to be met by [d] and the other adults in the household as well as by his mother.
the sibling relationship is of particular importance in this matter. both [g] and [x] view [mr fairfield] as their father. [d] has viewed him as a father-figure. both [mr fairfield] and [ms daffney] have been inconsistent in their parenting capacity, and it is likely that [d] [d]has offered significant stability to [x] since his birth, and to [g] as well. it is my view that the sibling relationship should be prioritised in this matter in order to support the children’s positive emotional connection with each other, which will provide them with a sense of belonging and associated positive psychological impacts. ... g) [x] has complex needs and while all children require stability and consistency, this is even more important for [x]. a change in his circumstances including separation from his mother would exacerbate his current challenging behaviours and decrease his psychological functioning. a change that included spending time with his father would have significant negative short- and medium-term negative impacts given that his mother does not currently present as able to manage his behaviours. if [x] were to have time with his father, it is expected that his challenging behaviours would become heightened for a period while he experienced a repeated attachment stress in relation to both of his parents. his mother would require a high level of competence in dealing with [x]’s behaviours to support him to cope with such stress.

g) [x] has complex needs and while all children require stability and consistency, this is even more important for [x]. a change in his circumstances including separation from his mother would exacerbate his current challenging behaviours and decrease his psychological functioning. a change that included spending time with his father would have significant negative short- and medium-term negative impacts given that his mother does not currently present as able to manage his behaviours. if [x] were to have time with his father, it is expected that his challenging behaviours would become heightened for a period while he experienced a repeated attachment stress in relation to both of his parents. his mother would require a high level of competence in dealing with [x]’s behaviours to support him to cope with such stress.

his honour: right. but if you assume that if you take out of the equation – in terms of your reasoning you take out of the equationing that the father, in your words, was likely to have sexually touched [d], if you take that out, do your recommendations remain the same? they would, because even if i take out my position or my – my suspicion that the father likely sexually abused [d], i’m left with the understanding that [d] believes that he sexually abused her and that the mother also has that position, so the psychological impacts are the same even if the risk issues are reduced.
so in terms of as far as you can predict, what sort of behaviours would you be concerned about for [x] if his honour were to make orders like the ones that the father seeks?---i think that the process of transitioning between two homes, both of which i hold concerns about the capacity for stable routine, would be problematic for [x]. [x] is a child who really needs a high level of stability and consistency and i think that – between those homes i don’t have confidence that the parents would be able to essentially be on the same page in terms of management strategies, emotional support strategies, supporting [x] to engage in emotional self-regulation himself, and that that would create significant confusion for [x] which would then lead to behavioural, you know, outbursts, meltdowns, tantrums, that – an increase in that oppositional behaviour that both his mother and the school were reporting. and i think that at the moment, acknowledging that [ms daffney] has said she has made some improvements in terms of her capacity to engage in positive management strategies, i’m concerned that with the high level of emotion that would come there that those – that her capacity would reduce, and that’s the household word. [x] would be spending the majority of her time in both of the proposals – sorry – of his time in both of the proposals.....for both children as well i think that if they were missing [mr fairfield], which i suspect that they are, that that would lead to increased distress for them... and, again, those behavioural – the behavioural expression of those emotional experiences i think is something that [ms daffney] would find quite difficult to deal with. and in terms of those potential behavioural changes in [x] and/or [d]and [g], are those sorts of behavioural difficulties the type of thing that’s likely to sort of blow up and then resolve very quickly, or are they things that are unlikely to be problematic over an extended period of time?---i think that the nature of the behaviours that we’re looking at are things that are likely to be extended, particularly with [x]’s particular vulnerabilities, the fact that he, to my understanding, is still not engaged – still doesn’t have a comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan. it doesn’t sound that there’s a solid support team around him as yet, so we’re looking at sort of vulnerabilities on top of vulnerabilities. and it’s the same again for [d] and whether she has got a history of self-harming behaviour. yes? i’m concerned about a resurgence in that, particularly while she has not engaged in counselling, and i’m concerned about her capacity – not her capacity, but her willingness to re-engage in counselling, despite a recognition that she would benefit from that, so i think that without access to appropriate supports and even with access to appropriate supports these are behaviours that could potentially persist for quite some time.
---it does exacerbate my concern. as i was speaking before in terms of the differences then between the homes, if we take an assumption that [ms daffney] is engaged in a process of attempting to learn appropriate management strategies and routines and apply greater consistency and stability in her home for [x], if these things are not then matched in the home with the father, that creates, i think, significant instability for [x], as i was saying before. but if the father is not willing to engage in a process around that, then that exacerbates those concerns that i hold.....but at the same time my report has been available i think the concerns in my report have been quite clear, and it’s of some concern to me that he’s now saying that he hasn’t taken any steps to understand some of the difficulties that [x] is presenting with.
and what is – when you said you could talk generally as to adhd, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, can you explain what your understanding is of that condition?---so it is a condition that typically emerges in children. it’s quite common to see that emerge at the point that a child commences kindergarten and those early years of school as the demands on the child are increased, so it creates disruptions in terms of a child’s capacity to focus, to pay attention, and so that is across a whole range of areas. so children with adhd will have difficulty in focussing in the classroom environment, in the home environment. they may have some areas that they’re able to focus on particular areas of interest, but not the same way that children without adhd are able to sit and focus on something that really interests them. so there’s the issue in terms of that, the concentration and focus, and then there are also issues in terms of hyperactive behaviour. so children might present as quite fidgety, moving quickly from one thing to the next. we see the same thing in terms of their conversation. they sort of jump about, you know, the things that don’t seem quite connected, but their – their brains are moving quite quickly and they move between different topics of discussion the same way that they will move around, you know, within a room. ... and odd, oppositional defiance disorder, do you know anything of that condition?---oppositional defiance disorder is one that we commonly see in conjunction with adhd, so there can be crossover. part of that is just due to similarity in some of the presentations. the children with oppositional defiance disorder will have difficulty in following instructions, they can be quite aggressive and engage in behavioural outbursts and, again, these are conditions that are behaviours that are seen across a different – different context, so not only in the home, not only at school, but across different contexts. yes?---there is quite a bit of crossover in terms of the behavioural symptoms that we see for adhd, odd, as well as anxiety and trauma, so it can be quite difficult to get a conclusive diagnosis between those conditions, which is why it’s really important to have somebody with a high level of expertise conducting the assessment.
and in terms of what you’ve just raised there about possibly [x] missing his father as contributing to those behaviours, notwithstanding that, does it remain the case that on the balance of what we should be doing in [x]’s best interests, him missing his father needs to be put aside in preference for stabilising him?---unfortunately it does in this case because we’re talking about quite a complex psychological process for a child, and i don’t have confidence that either of the parents have got the capacity to manage some of the nuances required around supporting [x] at this point in time. and do you agree with me that there’s a complicating factor there in terms of the parents having very limited ability to co-parent, which would just exacerbate their own deficits in that area? yes, that’s right.
his honour: well, just on that point, if you assume the child did say that to the father three years ago, “i want to go with you,” considering all the material that you’ve had before you, would the fact that the child didn’t go with the father at that time or hasn’t seen him for three years, explain all his behavioural issues that you’re aware the – or explain the extent of the behavioural issues that you understand he has experienced both at home and in the school environment over the last three years?---no, it would not. yes?---it’s certainly a possible contributor and it’s something that i was aware of at the time of preparing my report and that i believe i referenced in my report. i believe and i accept that [x] likely does miss his dad and that that is possibly contributing, but i don’t believe it explains the extent of the difficulties for [x].
and if this behaviour of [x] which has continued now for three years is to continue in the future, what effect could that have on his welfare?---as i said before, i think that his behaviour is likely having significant impacts on his academic, his social, psychological and behavioural functioning. it will impact his ability to engage at school, to learn, to keep up academically with his peers. also, behaviourally in terms of his peers. children who engage in a range of externalising behaviour such as [x] is, or is reported to be, can find it difficult to make friends, and that was certainly the information that i was provided by the school at the time that i spoke with them that he has difficulty connecting with his friends. there are associated psychological impacts from that in terms of low self-worth, you know, for a child who’s not keeping up academically and socially. you know, he needs quite a bit of support in terms of learning to effectively manage his emotions as well as his behaviours, and without receiving that support he’s likely to continue engaging in these behaviours which could have a whole range of negative outcomes for him.
---i contemplated the issue of supervised time and where that would work, where that would fit. i think that this – there are similar concerns for me in terms of the psychological impacts for – for [x] as well as for [d] and [g] and the instability that that would create within the home and within the sibling relationship which i think needs to be prioritised, acknowledging of course that [x] does not have contact with [h]. i also think that the issue around supervised time is not necessarily a viable long-term option and that there are costs associated with it that i would be quite difficult for the family to meet on a long-term basis. so yes, i think that supervised time would – would manage some issues but certainly not all of them and not to the point that it would remove my concern about the other risks that would arise.
but it may well be, based on the evidence of [x]’s behavioural interactions, that he will open up with his father and be content – more content with life, mightn’t it?---in my report i raise concerns about both parents’ parenting capacity and the ability of both parents to meet the complex needs that [x] presents with. in a best case scenario where a parent is able to attune to their child, to recognise their child’s emotional needs, to be able to provide emotional coaching and some coregulation and teach those self-regulation skills, then yes, that would lead to a reduction in the psychological and behavioural symptoms that a child might be exhibiting. i don’t have confidence in either parents’ ability to be able to do that for [x]. yes, but if the father’s time is limited to some quality day time doing some activities, for instance, they used to take [x] fishing. do you understand that?---i do. things might – that could well be very beneficial to [x], couldn’t it?---i think that [x] would very much enjoy that, but i think that he would have difficulty then managing that experience, then saying goodbye to his father understanding that he might not see his father again for some time, coming home and having a brother and sister who are upset with the implications of that, and having a mother who is not able to necessarily deal with the complexities of the psychological needs of three children that that arises.
there could be an order made though by the court requiring some continuing therapeutic intervention, couldn’t there be?---there absolutely could be, but there are no services that are available currently that will provide such an intervention free of charge or for minimal cost.
relevant legal principles
the best interests of the child
section 60cc considerations
subsection (2a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents: a primary consideration
subsection (2b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.  there is a significant risk that the father would be unable to adequately manage the child’s behavioural difficulties including oppositional behaviour. there is a significant risk that the father would use excessive physical discipline and/or verbal abuse including yelling in managing the child’s behavioural difficulties.
the child exhibits symptoms and challenging behaviour consistent with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (adhd), oppositional defiance disorder (odd) and anxiety. these symptoms have been exhibited by the child, inter alia, in the home environment of the mother. the father has no understanding of these disorders including their associated symptoms, with the court observing that he has not been exposed to the child’s challenging behaviours and so has limited insight into his needs, (whilst the court recognises that it is possible that the father could, in due course, educate himself in relation to these matters). the child experiences inter alia bed-wetting, and sleep issues. the father exhibited dysregulated and adverse behaviour during the parties’ relationship, for example, by yelling at the child when the child misbehaved, and biting d, then a child of 12 years, (albeit after d had slapped the father during a wrestling game) and the father has as yet taken no steps to personally address and rehabilitate himself in these respects. the single expert report writer had stated that the father struggled with appropriate self-regulation which impacted his parenting capacity.   there is a significant risk that the mother would be unable to adequately manage parenting the child on the child’s return to her household from having spent time with the father.
the mother’s present capacity to manage the child’s behaviours (who has special and high needs) is presently significantly limited by reason of, inter alia, her own dysregulated behaviour when caring for the child (the single expert report writer had stated that the mother struggled with appropriate self-regulation which impacted her parenting capacity), her present lack of education in relation to parenting skills for a child displaying symptoms of adhd and odd, her failure to fully access school support and health professional support for the child’s special needs, the parenting demands placed upon her by d’s own needs, and the mother’s needs to financially support her family. the mother has struggled post separation in adequately parenting the child by reason of the child’s special and high needs. in this context, the court notes that over about the past six months the mother has acquired some skills in disciplining the child (e.g. not yelling or arguing with the child, and giving the child options in the context of misbehaviour and complying with household rules) but such acquisition of skills and related health professional support is presently far from complete. the single expert report writer had stated that the child has significant emotional, developmental and mental health issues that require addressing, and as yet these have not been appropriately assessed and diagnosed. she stated that there are queries in relation to adhd, asd, odd, anxiety, and potentially a developmental or cognitive delay. she stated that the child requires immediate referral to a paediatrician for diagnostic clarification and a treatment plan, which may include medication, psychological intervention, parenting intervention for the mother, and holistic family intervention. as explained by the single expert report writer, if the child were to have time with the father, on his return to the mother’s household it is expected that his challenging behaviours would become heightened for a period while he experienced a repeated attachment stress in relation to both of his parents. the single expert report writer had stated that the child would likely experience strong emotions in response to seeing the father, and his current behavioural difficulties mean that he has limited resources to manage himself, he would likely demonstrate an increase in dysregulated behaviour in response to either positive or negative emotions. the mother would require a higher level of competence in dealing with the child’s heightened behaviours to support him to cope with such stress including strong emotions, however, the mother’s parenting capacity at present is inadequate in this regard. in these circumstances there is a significant risk the child would experience emotional harm together with adverse emotional impacts upon d and g, with resultant destabilisation of the mother’s family unit. the child and g view the father as their father. d has viewed the father as a father figure. there is a significant risk that d, believing as she does that the father inappropriately sexually touched her, and observing that she has previously assisted the mother in meeting the needs of the child (and g), would experience adverse emotional reactions in relation to the child spending time with the father. such adverse reactions may adversely affect the child’s relationship with d, and may adversely affect d assisting the mother in meeting the needs of the child (and g). and further, g may well react adversely to the child spending time with the father and the child’s relationship with g could thereby be adversely affected. with such outcomes, additional demands would be placed on the mother’s present limited parenting capacity (e.g. such demands as the need to manage any ruptures to the child’s relationship with g and d) which she would be unable to meet, with resultant negative impacts upon the child’s emotional state.   by reason of the above matters, should the child spend time with the father, the child’s present stability and consistency would be adversely affected with the significant risk of an exacerbation of his current challenging behaviours and decrease in his psychological functioning.
in the face of the complexities of this family, father and mother and household, you’ve suggested that – well, it has been suggested to you that there could be some therapy, some counselling, and you’ve given evidence just a few minutes ago that it would be unaffordable. but what sort of therapy would be needed in order to address the complex issues that face this family in the mother’s household?---in order for [x] to be able to spend time with his father and for there not to be the – not – for the risks that i’ve articulated to not come to fruition, or to be able to be managed appropriately, we would be talking about a fairly intensive family therapeutic support process whereby [x]’s vulnerabilities were able to be identified, that there would be some diagnostic clarity in terms of what the actual issues are, and that would help in terms of identifying the issue that was previously explored in terms of is medication appropriate or not. that would then give us a guideline in terms of what is needed to help [x] just currently be able to deal on a day to day basis, to offer some guidance for his mother to be able to support him around that. and then once that process – once things had stabilised as much as they could in relation to that process, then it would be looking at either jointly or after a period of time looking at therapeutic support for [d] and [g] as well to explore their relationship with [mr fairfield] to be able to offer them an opportunity to identify what their hopes and wishes are for a relationship with him. there would be a process whereby [ms daffney] would also engage in a therapeutic process to be able to understand her children’s complex psychological needs, to be able to manage with the competing different needs that each of the children may present with at different points. there would likely be some joint work that would occur between [ms daffney] and the three children because one of the primary goals would be around stabilising those relationships before [mr fairfield] could then be brought back into the picture. so if everything went along swimmingly, everyone was able to engage, things went well, the relationship between [ms daffney] and the children was stable and strong and she was able to deal with all of the things that life throws – throws up in the course of daily living, then consideration will be brought to bringing [mr fairfield] into that process. now, he would also have needed to undergone a process himself beforehand of understanding the children’s needs in terms of the vulnerabilities that [x] particularly presents with and what response is needed in relation to those, but also understanding the psychological impacts for [x], for [d] and for [g] around the separation process, the allegations, the previous criminal proceedings, [d]’s current belief that he sexually abused her and how he’s able to respond to that in a way that’s helpful for her. if he was able to do that, then we would look at bringing everybody together and starting a therapeutic process of reconnection which might involve the children having sessions with him where they could discuss that, where they could look at things they might need to be able to strengthen the relationship and feel safe within that relationship. and i will note that [d] and [g] both spoke to me about points of not feeling safe with [mr fairfield], so there – there are significant complex considerations i would be – we would be talking about weekly therapeutic sessions in some variation of individual/group. we would be talking about a number of clinicians needing to be involved, and that could take a process of years to be able to do that in a safe and structured, supported way. and that’s just not realistic, is it? not currently unfortunately.
