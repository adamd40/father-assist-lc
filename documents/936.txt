the “overarching consideration” is the interests of justice. it is not necessary to establish compelling circumstances. all that is required is that in the circumstances it is appropriate to exercise the power. in exercising the wide and unfettered discretion conferred by the power to make such an order, regard should be had to the fact that the usual order pursuant to s 79 is a once and for all order made after a final hearing, [emphasis added]  an applicant for orders for the partial distribution of property, at a time prior to final hearing, carries the onus of satisfying the court as to why it is in the interests of justice for such an order to be made, rather than for there to be a once and for all order made at final hearing, (f) as to the second step identified in strahan, the court should: (i) identify “the parties’ property and of their interests in it”, and (ii) consider and apply the provisions of section 79 and have regard to the impact of the order upon the respective parties at the point in time that the interim order is made, (g) however, it is also important to note the obligation on the parties and the court to further the main purpose of the family law rules 2004 (cth), to ensure that each case is resolved in a just and timely manner at a cost to the parties and the court that is reasonable in the circumstances of the case,[12] (h) it may be appropriate for there to be an order for the partial distribution of property to enable a party to proceedings to meet their legal costs or enable a party to avoid creditors, and (i) the interim orders made must be “amenable to adjustment on a final hearing”.   as to the second step identified in strahan, the court should: (i) identify “the parties’ property and of their interests in it”, and (ii) consider and apply the provisions of section 79 and have regard to the impact of the order upon the respective parties at the point in time that the interim order is made, (g) however, it is also important to note the obligation on the parties and the court to further the main purpose of the family law rules 2004 (cth), to ensure that each case is resolved in a just and timely manner at a cost to the parties and the court that is reasonable in the circumstances of the case,[12] (h) it may be appropriate for there to be an order for the partial distribution of property to enable a party to proceedings to meet their legal costs or enable a party to avoid creditors, and (i) the interim orders made must be “amenable to adjustment on a final hearing”.   identify “the parties’ property and of their interests in it”, and (ii) consider and apply the provisions of section 79 and have regard to the impact of the order upon the respective parties at the point in time that the interim order is made,  ) consider and apply the provisions of section 79 and have regard to the impact of the order upon the respective parties at the point in time that the interim order is made,   however, it is also important to note the obligation on the parties and the court to further the main purpose of the family law rules 2004 (cth), to ensure that each case is resolved in a just and timely manner at a cost to the parties and the court that is reasonable in the circumstances of the case,[12] (h) it may be appropriate for there to be an order for the partial distribution of property to enable a party to proceedings to meet their legal costs or enable a party to avoid creditors, and (i) the interim orders made must be “amenable to adjustment on a final hearing”.   it may be appropriate for there to be an order for the partial distribution of property to enable a party to proceedings to meet their legal costs or enable a party to avoid creditors, and (i) the interim orders made must be “amenable to adjustment on a final hearing”.   the interim orders made must be “amenable to adjustment on a final hearing”.
competing contentions  in accordance with the instruction in strahan, there ought not be two hearings with respect to property settlement, (b) one final hearing would provide certainty about her financial situation and ability to re-accommodate in a similar property close to where she and the children live, meaning this is compelling reason to discharge the orders made by the senior judicial registrar, (c) if the wife is forced to rent, she would need to use her capital to rehouse herself and the family, and this may lead to a spouse maintenance application and further proceedings, which is undesirable, and (d) there are no pressing financial circumstances for the husband. he earns $134,000 gross and is able to provide for his expenses.   one final hearing would provide certainty about her financial situation and ability to re-accommodate in a similar property close to where she and the children live, meaning this is compelling reason to discharge the orders made by the senior judicial registrar, (c) if the wife is forced to rent, she would need to use her capital to rehouse herself and the family, and this may lead to a spouse maintenance application and further proceedings, which is undesirable, and (d) there are no pressing financial circumstances for the husband. he earns $134,000 gross and is able to provide for his expenses.   if the wife is forced to rent, she would need to use her capital to rehouse herself and the family, and this may lead to a spouse maintenance application and further proceedings, which is undesirable, and (d) there are no pressing financial circumstances for the husband. he earns $134,000 gross and is able to provide for his expenses.   there are no pressing financial circumstances for the husband. he earns $134,000 gross and is able to provide for his expenses.   there was simply no evidence provided by the wife that the bank would likely continue the interest only repayment requirement or grant a hardship application, (b) there was ample evidence of the capacity of the wife to rehouse in a suitable property upon sale of the matrimonial home, pointing the realestate.com searches annexed to his second affidavit, (c) the cases of cord and riley can be differentiated to the present as they involved one party seeking to retain the matrimonial home on a final basis, (d) the final hearing would not occur within 12 months and stated it was more likely to be in the latter part of 2024 and there was simply no evidence the bank would be willing to give the parties grace until then, and (e) delays in resolving the proceedings were prejudicial to both parties because of the decreasing value of the property market and that there already was agreement of a $200,000 decline.   there was ample evidence of the capacity of the wife to rehouse in a suitable property upon sale of the matrimonial home, pointing the realestate.com searches annexed to his second affidavit, (c) the cases of cord and riley can be differentiated to the present as they involved one party seeking to retain the matrimonial home on a final basis, (d) the final hearing would not occur within 12 months and stated it was more likely to be in the latter part of 2024 and there was simply no evidence the bank would be willing to give the parties grace until then, and (e) delays in resolving the proceedings were prejudicial to both parties because of the decreasing value of the property market and that there already was agreement of a $200,000 decline.   the cases of cord and riley can be differentiated to the present as they involved one party seeking to retain the matrimonial home on a final basis, (d) the final hearing would not occur within 12 months and stated it was more likely to be in the latter part of 2024 and there was simply no evidence the bank would be willing to give the parties grace until then, and (e) delays in resolving the proceedings were prejudicial to both parties because of the decreasing value of the property market and that there already was agreement of a $200,000 decline.   the final hearing would not occur within 12 months and stated it was more likely to be in the latter part of 2024 and there was simply no evidence the bank would be willing to give the parties grace until then, and (e) delays in resolving the proceedings were prejudicial to both parties because of the decreasing value of the property market and that there already was agreement of a $200,000 decline.   delays in resolving the proceedings were prejudicial to both parties because of the decreasing value of the property market and that there already was agreement of a $200,000 decline.
evaluation and determination  there is no evidence about the likely date of a final hearing and the parties’ submissions reflect an agreed minimum position that a final hearing is likely to be up to 12 months from now, in circumstances where the proceedings commenced in august 2022, (b) there is no evidence adduced by the wife as to her capacity to acquire the husband’s interest in the matrimonial home, where the equity in it is in the vicinity of $900,000 based on the balance sheet received in evidence, she has conceded that it will likely need to be sold, and the wife’s response seeks a final order for sale of the property, and (c) in the above circumstances there is likely to be sufficient net value in the non-superannuation pool of assets to make final property orders that are just and equitable despite the sale of the property and distribution of some funds to the parties from the net sale proceeds on an interim basis.   there is no evidence adduced by the wife as to
