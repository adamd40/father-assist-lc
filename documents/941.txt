reasons for judgment

introduction
background
the issues
the evidence
the relevant legal principles
in some cases, the determination of “best interests” may well mean that one party’s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child’s “best interests” being served by orders which do not give one parent “optimal” arrangements or outcomes.
these rights, and the right of freedom of mobility of a parent, only defer to the paramount consideration of a child’s best interests where those interests would be so adversely affected as to justify such interference, and then the interference is legitimate only to the extent that it is necessary to avoid such adverse effects.   the best interests of the child are the paramount, but not the sole consideration, (b) the person seeking to move does not need to provide compelling reasons for the relocation sought, (c) the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the child’s best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the party who wishes to relocate.   the person seeking to move does not need to provide compelling reasons for the relocation sought, (c) the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the child’s best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the party who wishes to relocate.   the court must evaluate the competing proposals, giving consideration to how each proposal will provide advantages and disadvantages for the child’s best interests, (d) the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the party who wishes to relocate.   the question of whether there should be a relocation cannot be treated as a separate or discrete issue to that of the question of residence, (e) neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the party who wishes to relocate.   neither party bears an onus to establish that an order permitting or restraining relocation is in the children’s best interests, and (f) the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the party who wishes to relocate.   the court must weigh the competing proposals and consider all the relevant factors, including the right of freedom of movement of the party who wishes to relocate.
parental responsibility
best interests of the children   the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.   the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.
meaningful relationship
even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.
protection from harm
the additional considerations
any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity level or understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s views
the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child’s parents and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child)
the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of their parents or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom they have been living
the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
the capacity of each of the child’s parents and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs.
the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
reasonable practicability
reasonable practicality (5) in determining for the purposes of subsections (1) and (2) whether it is reasonably practicable for a child to spend equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the child’s parents, the court must have regard to:   how far apart the parents live from each other, and (b) the parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.   the parents’ current and future capacity to implement an arrangement for the child spending equal time, or substantial and significant time, with each of the parents, and (c) the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and   the parents’ current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and   the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and
