reasons for ex tempore judgment
judge o’shannessy introduction
background
... [the mother] and [the father] alleged significant and problematic alcohol misuse by the other party during the relationship, with both parties’ denying that these allegations about themselves are true. ... [the father] initially presented as calm and forth coming with information, but became combative, heightened and questioned the writer’s professional judgement, demonstrating poor emotional regulation when asked about the possible impact on [the child] spending a significant period of time away from her mother. [the father] apologised for the manner in which he spoke later in the conversation. [the father] identified that he was diagnosed with depression in october 2019 after the parties separated. he noted that he has been engaged with a psychologist since october 2020 and has completed approximately four sessions. he identified that he is well supported by his family and network of friends in [new south wales]. [the father] expressed concern for [the mother]’s mental health, alleging she presented with unpredictable mood and aggressive behaviour during the relationship and allegedly regularly blamed him for her “aggressive behaviour.” ... issues for the child [the child]’s early childhood experience of parental conflict, separation and alleged family violence. the significant period of time that has passed since [the child] has had contact with her father. geographical issues with regards to the parties residing in different states. [the child]’s young age and lack of independence which impacts the opportunity for extended spend time. ...  ..] september 2022) summary of observations the contact was positive in nature and the father managed the transport and safety of [the child] appropriately. the father ensured that all of [the child]’s basic care needs were met. the father engaged with [the child] in a soft and kind manner. the father was calm and did not mention the other party in front of [the child] while organising the location of contact. the worker had to consult with ... the director of family contact service to seek directions as the mother was disputing the b shopping precinct and trying to control the visit location. ... ([...] september 2022) final handover: (finish – 12:30pm) [the child] was transferred to maternal care without incident. at 12:40pm, the worker updated the mother on the details of the contact and the worker asked the mother if the father could have the pram dry cleaned and she could pick it up next tuesday. the mother said that she was not interested in having the pram dry cleaned. at 2:31pm the worker received the following message from the mother:
“if [the father] would like to help with things he can start off by paying the $11,770 (which he owes in child support unfortunately the $8.60 a week for 2.5 years did not provide for all of [the child]’s needs ☹) and then maybe help with the pram dry cleaning.”
summary of observations the visit was positive in nature for the father and [the child]. [the child] remained settled during the contact the entire visit. the father demonstrated positive parenting skills. the father was responsive and warm towards [the child]. no risks or concerns were identified during the visit.
give [the child] had made a clear disclosure regarding sexual abuse perpetrated by [the father], the matter was referred to the sexual offence and child-abuse investigation team (socit) of victoria police for a possible criminal investigation. [the child] was interviewed by [socit] again [in early 2023], at which time she disclosed that [the father] had moved her bather bottoms to the side and inserted his finger into her vagina. [the child] asked [the father] to stop and he complied. it was alleged that this occurred outside of the pool at the [accommodation] that [the father] would use during his contact with [the child]. ...
it is noted that [the child] has lived in the care of her mother ... since birth. [the mother] served as [the child]’s primary attachment and they appear to have a close and loving bond. child protection has been unable to identify any concerns for [the child] in the care of [the mother]. it is therefore recommended that [the child] remain in the care of her mother. child protection acknowledges that [the child] has the right to develop and maintain a relationship with her father ... however, this must be balanced with [the child]’s right to safety. it is the assessment of child protection that [the father] will require supervision when having in-person contact with [the child]. this will protect [the child] from the risk of sexual abuse in future and also preclude any further allegations being made against [the father]. given [the child]’s age, she cannot be expected to ensure her own safety while in contact with [the father].
