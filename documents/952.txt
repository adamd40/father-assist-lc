at interview, [y] (then aged 13 years [...]) arrived from her mother’s care dressed in pyjamas and no shoes. she was initially somewhat sullen, appearing to be disinterested in speaking to the writer with there being an observable annoyance by her to the process. however, this soon dissipated and [y] was talkative, engaged and interactive in the process of assessment speaking clearly with purpose and being fully participatory in the discussions held. it was a long interview.

the section 60cc factors
s.60cc(3)(a) any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child’s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child’s view
s.60cc(3)(c) the extent to which each of the child’s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major, long term issues in relation to the child, and to spend time with the child, and to communicate with the child
s.60cc(3)(ca) the extent to which each of the child’s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent’s obligations to maintain the child
s.60cc(3)(d) the likely effect of any changes in the child’s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living
s.60cc(3)(e) the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child’s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis
s.60cc(3)(f) the capacity of each of the child’s parents, and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs and s.60cc(3)(i) the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child’s parents
social integration within a peer group enhances their ability to engage socially, thereby translating to the overall well-being of these individuals. conversely, when the individuals become isolated and are unable to interact effectively with friends through such group interactions, their overall well-being is thwarted.
s.60cc(3)(g) the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child’s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant
s.60cc(3)(j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child’s family
mother attempts to report a breach of the dvo. father recording changeover. police ascertained that the matter reported did not constitute a breach and that the actions of the respondent (the father) given the number of previous (4) unsubstantiated breaches reported by her. then attempts to report previous matters to police already investigated. told complaint will be noted but no action will be taken. dvo was due to expire next day so she told police she wanted to get a new one. police are of the opinion that this report to police was reported as a means of getting the dvo extended. however, there is no evidence to support a need to have this order extended.
the mother said to police that she understood it was not a police matter, but that her lawyer had told her to report it. the report continues the mother prolifically reports matters to police that do not constitute contraventions of the dv order. this informant has attended a number of police stations to report similar matters and a further email has been received by the r/o from the informant on 16 june 2015 for a similar occurrence will be furnished. the informant has been advised not to email members of the service directly and to attend police station in person if she has any concerns. police refer to mother as serial complainant – complaint re father emailing her about berries the child eats – officer notes their firm view that such reports are being made to advance the m’s position in the lead up to the hearing date of the father’s application.
s.60cc(3)(k) if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child’s family – any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order
s.60cc(3)(l) whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child
the primary considerations
s.60cc(2)(a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child’s parents, and
s.60cc(2)(b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence
the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility (s.61da)
