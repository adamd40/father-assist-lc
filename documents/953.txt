items 18 and 19: jewellery
item 20: coins and old bank notes collection
..regarding your coins collection, our client vehemently denies your vexatious claim against her. she did not take your collection of bank notes and coins. our client left the property without preplanning due to the family physical violence against her and she has not return [sic] since the incident. however, your sister advised our client that the property [d street, suburb c] was burgled. this could explain the disappearance of your prize notes and coins collection.
our client does not have your coin collection. you have misplaced it and cannot blame our client for losing it. she does not know where the collection is and has no reason to lie about your coin collection.
add backs
we observe that “notional property”, which is sometimes “added back” to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute “property of the parties to the marriage or either of them”, and thus is not amenable to alteration under s79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage – and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that s 79(4) and in particular s75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property.
...when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not “exceptional” justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion — usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is “a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct” than adding back to the list of existing interests in property. (footnotes omitted)
items 23 - 30: addbacks asserted by the husband in relation to the j street, suburb c property   dieu] had skimmed $100 off the top of our joint weekly rental income from the [j street, suburb c] property and the money was deposited into his personal cba account and i’m not sure for how long this type of activity has been going on for if at all prior to separation.

items 34 and 37 – maintenance and renovation to the b street, suburb c property and loss of rent for the b street, suburb c property
unfortunately, i never saw nor heard nor i can get in touch with [mr w] in october 2019. i paid [mr w] up to $50,000 before he disappeared.
based on the building inspection report, in my opinion the resident [sic] is not habitable due to: unsafe electrical wiring, unsafe plumbing, leaking roof, damaged windows, presence of mould within the property, healing paint, suspected o [sic] be lead paint, presence of broken and loose asbestos, and general dilapidated nature of the property. in my opinion, no funds have been spent in the last 10 years for the general maintenance and upkeep of the property.
warning supply to this service has been discontinued for safety reasons do not attempt to reconnect supply. supply can only be reconnected by an authorised agent of [company x]. removal of this seal will result in legal action taken.
items 38 to 40 – addbacks asserted by the husband in relation to the d street, suburb c property
her honour: there were some orders made in 2021 by consent that you have sole occupation of [d street, suburb c] and you be responsible for all the rates and outgoings for that property, so why would i now make the wife responsible for that? husband: 8 june 2021... so if you look - i have only included from 2017 to 2021. her honour: so why are you saying i should make an order that the wife be responsible for half of those outgoings? husband: from 2017 to 2021 i propose to go 50/50 with her. her honour: i understand that, but you need to tell me why i would do that? husband: well because that is not usage – it’s fixed whether you live there or not you still have to pay for it. if it’s water usage or something that i use, then yes, i’m willing to pay for that. but this is an annual or quarterly or thing that whether you live there or not you still have to pay for it.

whether an order altering property interests should be made
the assessment of contributions
put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party’s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties’ respective contributions within s 79.  ] ...established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties’ respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the post separation period to the point of assessment...
therefore, it is an item under my name solely own without entering the item into the marriage. it remains separate from the relationship and that i retain 100% ownership of the property without any complications.
