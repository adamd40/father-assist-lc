reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
i have been unable to seek work outside of the home due the unpredictable needs of the children, their current mental health struggles, and [x’s] ongoing recovery from [her mental illness] which has been slow and exacerbated by delays in this matter. when the needs of the children permit, i hope to complete my [...] studies and find part-time employment.[10]
i have always left the financial records and banking to my wife. since our separation, i have had the opportunity to read some of our bank accounts and mortgage loan statements. i have a serious concern that there are a number of transactions and money transfers which i did not know about and i now want the opportunity to check all our records.[14]
orders sought by the parties
the conduct of the proceedings
the applicant has made repeated demands that i provide him with 20 years of bank statements and threatens that he will have a full forensic investigation of our accounts over this period. he has made vague and unspecified allegations that he now mistrusts my management of our finances in the marriage. i have provided both the applicant and his solicitor large quantities of documents and historical financial paperwork but he still continues to demand more. i received a further request from the applicant’s solicitor on 10 december 2020 for additional historical documents (including those the applicant himself has access to) and further aggressive texts from the applicant.[15]
i have been undertaking a great deal of research into various transactions that occurred during our marriage, in order to endeavour to trace various amounts of money, in circumstances where i believe that my wife, who managed all our finances during our marriage, has removed significant funds from our joint enterprise and has not accounted for those funds. i believe that obtaining the documents that i require from [v bank] will enable me to prove that funds provided by that loan were not applied for the purchase of a motor vehicle, as was alleged at the time, and that those funds have been applied elsewhere. i have engaged [mr w], a chartered accountant, to assist me with enquiries.[17]
i have formed the view that the respondent has, over a long period of time, removed very substantial sums of money for our various accounts, and i believe that she has not fully disclosed funds which she has hidden from me.[18]
the source of this belief was said to be based on his examination of ms roswell’s financial disclosure in the case.
for financial years ended 30 june 2002 to 30 june 2008 inclusive, there is a shortfall in the reported turnover of the company in each said financial year by approximately $800,000.00 totalling $5,600.00 for the said financial years.[19]
in this context, he asserts that ms roswell appears to have cash loaded credit cards in her name.
upon noting the parties have reached and in-principle agreement with the assistance of [the] judicial registrar [...] and require further time to finalise a consent minute of order and to allow procedural fairness to be afforded the court orders that: further consideration of the matter is adjourned to 18 august 2022 at 2.15pm for consideration of consent orders to be made finalising the matter noting the proceedings will be conducted face to face at court.
ms roswell relied only on the affidavit material, which she had personally deposed and filed.
the evidence
although the visa was a personal account, as it was also used for company expenses, i accounted for all transactions made on it in the company books, with those credits and debits of a personal nature for the husband, myself, and the children, such as food, education costs and medical expenses, recorded against director's loan account [...00] in myob. lump sum payments paying down the visa account from our personal accounts were recorded as a credit on the [...00] account. company expenses included fuel, insurances, and licensing to name a few, in addition to those trade supplier payments, such as [u company], were allocated to their relevant expense accounts. transactions for the director's loan [...00] account for the period 1/7/2008 to 30/6/2020 were disclosed on 2 march 2021for the husband's forensic accountant. [cc company] paid us via cheque on a weekly basis, whereas company suppliers, such as [u company], provided payment terms to us of 30 days after the end of month. as funds received from [cc company] were not required until end of month to pay accounts, in the interim, and to maximise the benefit of being in receipt of said funds, i would transfer lump sums out of the [n pty ltd] company account, that weren't required at the time, into the [town d] offset account, to reduce interest accruing on that loan for benefit of the parties. the husband was aware of this. i would then transfer into either the company account or visa credit card account, as required to pay bill. whilst i acknowledge that i moved funds between accounts, neither the husband, nor his forensic accountant [mr w] has provided any evidence of wrongdoing.[23]
the legal principles applicable
given the evaluation of contribution based entitlements inevitably moves from qualitative evaluation of contributions to a quantitative reflection of such evaluation, there will inevitably be a “leap” from words to figures. that is the nature of the exercise of discretion, whether it be in the assessment of contributions in the matrimonial cause, assessment of damages in a personal injuries case, or determination of compensation in a land resumption case...
the expression ‘just and equitable’ is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[36]
as a result of those matters, the court’s approach to s 79/s90sm may be less compartmentalised than what a strict or unthinking adherence to four (or three) “steps” might otherwise reveal. the task is essentially holistic, is it just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the particular relationship or marriage under consideration to make an order and, if so, its terms must similarly meet that criteria. of course, holistic though the approach is, it must be referenced to what the act requires and care must be taken to ensure that the court’s reasons make that clear.[37]
where the court has determined that it is just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79(2) or s 90sm(3) and there is clear evidence that one party has engaged in conduct and, but for that conduct, the legal and equitable interests of a party or the parties (or the value of those interests) would have be significantly greater, justice and equity may require recognition of the unfairness inherent in those circumstances in the terms of the orders to be made. how might that be recognised? first, consistent with existing authority, it can be recognised pursuant to s 75(2)(o) (cf s 90sf(3)(r)). secondly, it might be contended that it might be recognised within the assessment of contributions. this court has long eschewed the notion of “negative contributions”. nevertheless, it might be argued that the “non-dissipating party” can be seen to have made a disproportionally greater indirect contribution to the existing legal and equitable interests (for example to their preservation) if it is established that, but for the other party’s unilateral dissipation, those existing legal and equitable interests would have been greater or had a greater value. the assessment of the circumstance under discussion is, ultimately, a matter of discretion. equally, however, authority dictates that it will be “the exception rather than the rule” that a direct dollar adjustment equivalent to the amount of the alleged dissipation of the pool is made to the otherwise entitlement of a party. it may be that aspects of the erstwhile treatment of legal fees pre-stanford will require further consideration in an appropriate case. importantly, of course, as has been emphasised in many authorities including those cited above, not every dissipation by a party can be seen to involve an affront to justice and equity, again the circumstances of the individual relationship must be assessed. (citations removed)[45]
two fundamental premises emerge from omacini and the authorities preceding it. first, ‘adding back’ is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not ‘exceptional’ justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion – usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is ‘a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct’ than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.
this decision appears to confirm the principle that where the payment of legal costs can be regarded as a premature distribution of funds (in which both parties have an interest), it is appropriate to add back those costs as a notional asset. it also confirms the principle that where funds have been borrowed to pay legal fees, and such liability is still outstanding, neither the payment of the fees nor the liability should be taken into account. the decision also supports the proposition that where it is determined that a payment of legal fees should be taken into account as a notional asset, any outstanding liability in respect of those fees should also be taken into account. in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post-separation income or acquisitions.[49]
it is well settled that save in exceptional circumstances a trial judge should deal with the property as at the date of the hearing and make adjustments taking into account the various matters set out under s.79. however, the particular justice of the case may make it appropriate to notionally add back assets which have been demonstrated to have been dissipated either during the marriage or post-separation. normally it is necessary to demonstrate an appropriate basis for doing so, for example by wastage such as gambling or extravagant living. additionally, because of the requirement for each party to bear their own costs, it is generally appropriate to add back to the pool of assets notionally any legal costs that have been spent on the litigation and to deal with the costs as a separate issue at the end of the litigation. there seems to be no appropriate basis for notionally adding back moneys that existed at separation but which have been subsequently spent on meeting reasonably incurred necessary living expenses. neither the family law act nor the case law require that parties go into a state of suspended economic animation once their marriage breaks down pending the resolution of their financial arrangements. parties are entitled to continue to provide for their own support. whether any expenditure so incurred is reasonable or extravagant is a matter that can be determined by the trial judge.[50]
issues value of former family home
we have assessed the value of the shedding to be $80,000 and the pool to be $30,000 which includes pool fencing and perimeter paving. the total value not included in this assessment is $110,000 due to permits not being obtained.  value of holiday home at town d
the husband was involved in the parties gaining council approval for the [...] shed, attached [structure], and room addition, (which originally received approval as [an outdoor structure], and was later enclosed via the introduction of materials to form two walls to create a room referred to as the 'dwelling addition' in the report, for which the underlying council approved [outdoor] structure was not altered to accommodate said walls)... the shed and [attached structure] have full council approval, adding $50,000 to the valuation, and i seek only $5,000 of the possible $55,000 for the dwelling addition for the approved [outdoor structure], giving a total value of $445,000 i seek be attributed to the [town d] property in the asset pool.[55]
ms roswell has supplied what she asserts are the relevant council approvals for these structures.[56] this evidence is the basis for her claim that the town d property should be included in the asset pool at a value of $445,000.00.  monies withdrawn from the line of credit/legal fees and issues to do with the family trust other contributions other liabilities hat emerges from the authorities is that while there might be a “rule” the application of which is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, the manner in which a particular liability should be treated is, ultimately, dependent upon the nature of the liability, the circumstances surrounding the liability and the dictates of justice and equity shaped by each. the usual practice or “rule” sits comfortably and conformably within that rubric – in many cases, perhaps almost all, liabilities will be deducted from the “gross” value of the property because it will be clear (and even if not expressly stated, determined) that the justice and equity of the case demands that the liabilities should be met by the parties in the proportions in which the court determines the property is to be divided.  legal costs
the court should not depart lightly from the ordinary rules relating to costs between party and party and the circumstances justifying the departure should be of an exceptional kind.[66]
