history
that save for the wife’s costs incurred in respect of any unsuccessful or partially unsuccessful application in a case filed on her behalf in the property proceedings, and save for any other of the wife’s costs incurred in respect of an application in a case filed on behalf of either party in the property proceedings where costs orders were made against the wife: the husband pay the wife’s costs of and incidental to the property proceedings, and of this application, to be assessed on a party/party basis, on the family court scale of costs, as and from the date of the making of the first offer to settle on 29 april 2016.
friday, 1 november 2019 12:58:35 aest good morning [mr carron], we refer to the above appeal and note that the matter has been brought on for mention on 5 november 2019. we confirm that there is no utility in proceeding with the appeal in circumstances where the orders for costs in relation to judge egan’s orders are redundant. kindly file and serve your notice of discontinuance as a priority. in circumstances where you fail, neglect or refuse to discontinue the proceedings and we are required to attend by telephone on 5 november 2019, we are instructed to seek a costs order be made against you on an indemnity basis and we shall rely upon this email in respect of same. we trust common sense will prevail in these circumstances. we look forward to receiving your filed notice of discontinuance by the close of business today. kind regards [ms d] friday, 1 november 2019 1:18 pm [dear ms d] in order to provide certainty in this matter, please provide written confirmation that your client agrees to jointly request that the costs order dated 4 december 2019 [sic] be set aside as part of the proceedings currently being heard by her honour judge turner. once that is received, a notice of discontinuance will be filed. yours faithfully [mr carron] friday, 1 november 2019 14:29:07 aest [hi mr carron], for clarity, our client is seeking that judge turner make a costs order against you on an indemnity basis and we are instructed to file an application for costs as directed by judge turner yesterday once the matter has been finally determined. the orders made by judge egan are no longer relevant and should you not discontinue your appeal in relation to the orders made by judge egan then we shall submit to [the registrar] that your intention is simply to inflate our client’s legal fees. where [the registrar] is unwilling to make that costs order, we shall bring it to judge turner’s attention in our application for costs as discussed above. we hope this clears up any confusion you may have with respect to our client’s position on costs.” kind regards [ms d] friday, 1 november 2019 3:04 pm i refer to [the registrar’s] letter dated 31 october 2019 where she states there has been no advice as to “whether the parties have reached an accommodation which will enable this appeal to be discontinued”. i also note that the costs order was stayed pending the outcome of appeal no 117/2018. discontinuing that appeal would remove that stay. i have been advised that your client’s response is unclear in regards to the existing order and that discontinuing the appeal without reaching an accommodation would be unwise. in order to facilitate a resolution to the matter i state that my understanding from your response is that your client will not be pursuing enforcement of that order and will be seeking a new costs order. please advise if this is incorrect. failure to respond by 5pm today will taken [sic] as your client’s acceptance of this understanding and i will file a notice of discontinuance accordingly. yours faithfully [mr carron] 01/11/2019 15:06 [hi mr carron], our client will not be pursuing the order made by judge egan in relation to costs. our client instructs us to seek a costs order against you in relation to the order that judge turner will make as a result of the trial yesterday. kind regards [ms d]
if parties wish to pursue a costs application and the appropriate application and supporting affidavit is to be filed in accordance with the legislation.
the respondent husband pay the applicant wife's taxed costs of and incidental to the initiating application filed on 9 september 2016 on an indemnity basis.
what costs need to be determined?  ] i am somewhat confused by the submissions of the wife as the wife is seeking indemnity costs from the commencement of her initiating application in september 2016 for both parenting and property matters. [23] i find that a costs order already exists as to the property proceedings up to and including the first property hearing as a costs order was made by judge egan in december 2018. [24] i find that in addition to the already existing costs order by judge egan there are two further areas where costs are to be considered, namely: a) the property proceedings from july 2019 when the full court remitted the property matter for rehearing until the delivery of the property judgment by judge turner in march 2020. b) the parenting proceedings from september 2016 to the making of final parenting orders by consent in july 2019. [25] i will now consider each of these areas in determining what costs orders are to be made.  ] i find that a costs order already exists as to the property proceedings up to and including the first property hearing as a costs order was made by judge egan in december 2018.

december 2018 costs order [26] on 4 december 2018 judge egan made the following costs order
“save for the wife’s costs incurred in respect to any unsuccessful or partially unsuccessful application in a case filed on her behalf in the property proceedings and save for any other of the wife’s costs incurred in respect of an application in a case filed on behalf of either party in the property proceedings where costs orders were made against the wife... the husband pay the wife’s costs of and incidental to the property proceedings, and of this application, to be assessed on a party/party basis, on the family court scale of costs, as and from the date of making of the first offer to settle on 29 april 2016”  ] the husband appealed the costs order and the parties agreed to stay the costs order pending the outcome of the appeal. [28] the husband subsequently discontinued the appeal therefore reinstating the december 2018 costs order. [29] as the issue of costs for property proceedings up to and including the september 2018 costs application has been judicially determined then i find that there is no basis for this costs judgment to be disturbed. [30] as to determining in dollar terms the amount of costs payable pursuant to the december 2018 costs order, i direct that the wife file and serve her calculation of the party/party costs with the husband having a right to comment as to the calculation.

[11] the only issue left for this court to determine is what is a fair calculation of the costs payable by the husband to the wife pursuant to the orders made by judge egan in december 2018.

discussion
12.51 setting aside a costs assessment order   this rule applies to a party who is liable to pay costs and receives a costs assessment order under subrule 12.44(1) or 12.50(3). (2) the party may, within 14 days after receiving the costs assessment order, apply to have it set aside.
note: if a party wishes to object to a costs assessment order after an assessment hearing has taken place, the party must do so in accordance with part 12.9.
promissory estoppel certainly extends to representations (or promises) as to future conduct... in principle there is certainly no reason why the doctrine should not apply so as to preclude departure by a person from a representation that he will not enforce a non-contractual right...
true it is that in the orthodox case of promissory estoppel, where the promisor promises that he will not exercise or enforce an existing right, the elements of reliance and detriment attract equitable intervention on the basis that it is unconscionable for the promisor to depart from his promise, if to do so will result in detriment to the promisee.
none the less the proposition, by making the enforcement of the promise conditional on (a) a reasonable expectation on the part of the promisor that his promise will induce action or forbearance by the promisee and (b) the impossibility of avoiding injustice by other means, makes it clear that the promise is enforced in circumstances where departure from it is unconscionable.
one may therefore discern in the cases a common thread which links them together, namely, the principle that equity will come to the relief of a plaintiff who has acted to his detriment on the basis of a basic assumption in relation to which the other party to the transaction has “played such a part in the adoption of the assumption that it would be unfair or unjust if he were left free to ignore it”: per dixon j. in grundt [(1937) 59 clr at 675], see also thompson [(1933) 49 clr at 547]. equity comes to the relief of such a plaintiff on the footing that it would be unconscionable conduct on the part of the other party to ignore the assumption.
an equitable estoppel is binding in conscience on the party estopped, and it is to be satisfied by that party doing or abstaining from doing something in order to prevent detriment to the party raising the estoppel which that party would otherwise suffer by having acted or abstained from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation which he has been induced to adopt. perhaps equitable estoppel is more accurately described as an equity created by estoppel.
that brings me to estoppel, a label which covers a complex array of rules spanning various categories. there are divisions between common law and equitable estoppel, between estoppel by conduct and estoppel by representation, and the distinction between present and future fact. there are titles such as promissory estoppel, propriety estoppel, and estoppel by acquiescence. yet all of these categories and distinctions are intended to serve the same fundamental purpose, namely “protection against the detriment which would flow from a party's change of position if the assumption (or expectation) that led to it were deserted”: waltons stores [(1988) 164 clr at 419], per brennan j. see also per mason cj and wilson j [(1988) 164 clr at 404], grundt [(1937) 59 clr at 674 675].
the result is it should be accepted that there is but one doctrine of estoppel, which provides that a court of common law or equity may do what is required, but not more, to prevent a person who has relied upon an assumption as to a present, past or future state of affairs (including a legal state of affairs), which assumption the party estopped has induced him to hold, from suffering detriment in reliance upon the assumption as a result of the denial of its correctness. a central element of that doctrine is that there must be proportionality between the remedy and the detriment which is its purpose to avoid.
