reasons for judgment
judge brown:
introduction
after the [e street] property became uninhabitable, i was prepared to try and fix it up and either live in it or rent it. by then [mr hale] and i had taken over paying most of the expenses for the [e street] property anyway because dad could no longer afford to. however, at the last minute, after the transfer document had been signed and i had paid the funds into a solicitor’s trust account for the purchase price, my mother changed her mind and refused to proceed with the transfer. due to [mr hale] and i paying many expenses for the [e street] property and our physical and financial contributions in managing the farm leases and farming at [the [region n] farmland], the plant and equipment of the trust was transferred to us as payment. [mr hale] is not the sole director and secretary of the company.[6]
the length of cohabitation between the wife and me was accordingly about 11 years 2 months but with countless separations in between.[7]
procedural history of the litigation
legal considerations
subject to this part, to the regulations and the applicable rules of court, all decrees made under this act may be enforced by any court having jurisdiction under this act.   if: (a) an order under this act has directed a person to execute a deed or instrument, and (b) that person has refused or neglected to comply with the direction or, for any other reason, the court considers it necessary to exercise the powers of the court under this subsection,   an order under this act has directed a person to execute a deed or instrument, and (b) that person has refused or neglected to comply with the direction or, for any other reason, the court considers it necessary to exercise the powers of the court under this subsection,   that person has refused or neglected to comply with the direction or, for any other reason, the court considers it necessary to exercise the powers of the court under this subsection,
the court may appoint an officer of the court or other person to execute the deed or instrument in the name of the person to whom the direction was given and to do all acts and things necessary to give validity and operation to the deed or instrument.
i have come to the conclusion that, in a matter which affects closely the property rights of a party, i should interpret strictly the language of the act and consequently it cannot be said that a person has refused or neglected to comply with a direction unless that obligation of that person has been clearly spelt out. for that reason, i hold that there must be a specific order directing the wife to execute a deed or instrument before sec. 84(1) [the precursor to section 106a] can operate. once that direction has been given and not complied with, the court may appoint an officer of the court to execute the deed or instrument in question in the name of the person to whom the direction was given and further to do all acts and things necessary to give validity and operation to the deed or instrument. in other words, there is no need to specify the execution of all ancillary documents.
3.1 that, the [e street] property shall be listed for sale by private treaty with a registered real estate agent to be agreed in writing by both parties within 30 days of the date of this order. 3.2 the list price of the [e street] property shall be such amount as is agreed between the parties and failing agreement as advised by the real estate agent. 3.3 the parties agree that the reserve price for the sale of the [e street] property will be $95,000.00. 3.4 the parties are to co-operate in every way with the real estate agent in relation to the marketing of the [e street] property for sale including making the property readily available, allowing inspection of the [e street] property at all times as may be reasonably requested by the agent. it is noted that if the applicant wishes to make improvements to the property, that she is at liberty to do so at her sole expense. 3.5 that upon agreement being reached for sale of the [e street] property the parties shall execute the contract of sale and other documents necessary to complete the sale of the [e street] property including all transfer documentation forthwith upon its submission to them by the agent or their solicitor. 3.6 within seven days of the execution of the contract of sale, the parties are to appoint a conveyancer to effect settlement and such conveyancer to be agreed in writing by both parties. 3.7 the contract of sale shall provide for a settlement date 30 days after the date of the contract. 3.8 that until settlement of the [e street] property, the applicant agrees to:
3.8.1 pay all rates and taxes levied against the [e street] home until settlement of sale of the [e street] home, 3.8.2 insure the [e street] home including public liability, contents and all buildings and structures and other improvements against fire, explosion, lighting, storm and civil commotion including vandalism, malicious damage and burglary, 3.8.3 maintain the [e street] home, and 3.8.4 allow the applicant peaceful possession and occupation of the [e street] home, if applicable, without interruption or disturbance from the respondent. 3.8.5 the proceeds of the sale of the [e street] property shall be paid in the following manner and priority: 3.8.6 in payment of all costs of and incidental to the sale of the property including the agents fees and conveyancing costs, 3.8.7 the sum of thirty thousand dollars to be retained in the trust account of ezra legal pty ltd, 3.8.8 the sum of thirty thousand dollars to be retained in the trust account of mellor olsson, 3.8.9 balance to remain in the nominated conveyancers trust account until further order or the written agreement of the parties. that in the event the [e street] property has not been sold or transferred within six months of the date of this order the parties shall be at liberty to apply to the court for an order concerning the listing price or other matters relating to the sale of the property.
