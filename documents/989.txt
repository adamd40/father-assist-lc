item 8 shall be removed from the balance sheet.   beginning in about mid 2015 when the wife ceased working (as a hospitality worker, she was aged 42 years at this time) and up to at least the date of mr s’s affidavit filed 27 october 2022, mr s loaned monies to the wife. these monies were used by the wife to pay the mortgage loan repayments for the property, to pay legal fees, and to meet her living expenses, (b) mr s sold his own property in 2018 and with his proceeds of sale he began to make direct payments from his bank account to the wife’s westpac home loan bank account in payment of the wife’s home loan with westpac, (c) the totality of his financial assistance to the wife, as referred to in a) and b) above, up to the date of mr s and the wife entering into a deed of loan being april 2019, was about $273,155 (being a figure referred to in the deed of loan), (d) mr s continued to make direct payments from his bank account to the wife’s westpac home loan bank account in payment of the wife’s home loan with westpac, mr s made discrete payments in this regard on 17 june 2022, $2,350, on 15 july 2022, $2,350, and on 17 august 2022, $2,400 (these 3 payments totalling $7,100), (e) the wife’s bank statements from westpac from 2015 to august 2022 reveal significant deposits into her bank account for mortgage repayments which are consistent with mr s having assisted the wife financially in meeting her mortgage loan repayments over this period as asserted by him, (f) the wife, again, utilised monies loaned from mr s to pay legal fees. her former lawyers, ax lawyers, were owed $80,000 by the wife for their fees and these fees were paid. the court infers that the wife utilised monies loaned from mr s to pay these fees of $80,000 because the wife has not worked since mid 2015, these proceedings were commenced in november 2014, the wife’s initial response was filed in late march 2015, and these lawyers ceased acting for her in about september 2016 (see the notice of withdrawal as lawyer of ax lawyers filed 14 october 2016). the wife does not allege an alternative source of monies to pay these legal fees other than mr s, (g) the wife probably has a legally enforceable obligation to repay mr s at least $280,000 pursuant to the above deed of loan, however of this sum the amount of $80,000 should not be reasonably allowed as having been likely borrowed by the wife from mr s to pay her legal fees owed to ax lawyers.   mr s sold his own property in 2018 and with his proceeds of sale he began to make direct payments from his bank account to the wife’s westpac home loan bank account in payment of the wife’s home loan with westpac, (c) the totality of his financial assistance to the wife, as referred to in a) and b) above, up to the date of mr s and the wife entering into a deed of loan being april 2019, was about $273,155 (being a figure referred to in the deed of loan), (d) mr s continued to make direct payments from his bank account to the wife’s westpac home loan bank account in payment of the wife’s home loan with westpac, mr s made discrete payments in this regard on 17 june 2022, $2,350, on 15 july 2022, $2,350, and on 17 august 2022, $2,400 (these 3 payments totalling $7,100), (e) the wife’s bank statements from westpac from 2015 to august 2022 reveal significant deposits into her bank account for mortgage repayments which are consistent with mr s having assisted the wife financially in meeting her mortgage loan repayments over this period as asserted by him, (f) the wife, again, utilised monies loaned

not be reasonably allowed as having been likely borrowed by the wife from mr s to pay her legal fees owed to ax lawyers.   the totality of his financial assistance to the wife, as referred to in a) and b) above, up to the date of mr s and the wife entering into a deed of loan being april 2019, was about $273,155 (being a figure referred to in the deed of loan), (d) mr s continued to make direct payments from his bank account to the wife’s westpac home loan bank account in payment of the wife’s home loan with westpac, mr s made discrete payments in this regard on 17 june 2022, $2,350, on 15
