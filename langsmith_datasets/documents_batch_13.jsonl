example, about how the husband had expended monies or superannuation or income that he brought into the relationship on either the front or back of the [b street] property or of the other properties acquired. the husband said this expenditure was corroborated by an examination of banking records. the wife\u2019s own examination of those banking records was some time before the trial, limited to a couple of hours, and i find not a detailed and careful examination necessary if a proper contradiction of the husband\u2019s assertions was to be made. i find the wife failed to, or was slow to, concede the husband\u2019s work and expenditure on the various properties. this was not because his assertions were contradicted by her examination or knowledge of contemporaneous banking and other records, but because it appeared to her not to suit her case to make such concessions. this goes to the reliability of the wife\u2019s evidence. ... hence, in proportional terms the wife\u2019s initial contributions are about 22.55% and the husband\u2019s initial contributions about 77.45% of the parties\u2019 initial and extraneous contributions. ... taking account of all of the parties contributions over the whole of the relationship and between separation and final hearing, i assess the wife has having contributed in the proportion of 21% and the husband is having contributed in the proportion 79%. ... date description amount september-october 2020 preparation for final hearing \u2013 2 day matter $6,277.00 17 may, 20 may, 11 august, 12 august preparation for final hearing

authority binding on me requires any cost order made in pursuance of s 117(2) upon demonstration of one of the matters in s 117(2a) to be just. and also pennisi & pennisi (1997) flc-92-774 (\u2018pennisi\u2019) at 85,547: and also pennisi & pennisi (1997) flc-92-774 (\u2018pennisi\u2019) at 85,547: ... it is not the law that an offer of greater or equivalent value to that which results from the court will lead to an order for costs in favour of the offeror ... we would also add that just because an offer is marginally less than the amount ordered by a court does not mean that it is not a factor to be taken into account in determining whether costs should be awarded ... the plain words [of s 117(2a)(f)] do not limit a court\u2019s attention to offers which are greater than the amount awarded. nor does the paragraph state what consequences flow from whether the offer is greater or lesser than the amount awarded, or how much that is the case. words of limitation should not be imported into the provision and nor should it be read as though offers in proceedings under the act carry the same consequences as payments into court in common law matters. we do however, consider that the closer the offer is to the award when the offer is under the amount awarded by the court, the more weight that should be given to this factor in considering the question of costs. the principle must not, however, be rigidly applied. offers must be seen in the context of the case and the extent of the offeree\u2019s knowledge of the parties\u2019 financial circumstances while the offer is live. in the family law jurisdiction, it is not uncommon to find relationships where one party, often the wife, has significantly less grasp of the parties\u2019 financial arrangements, or the financial circumstances are so complex that it would be premature to accept an offer. there are also cases where the contents of the offer are in themselves the subject of disputed value and legitimate subject matter for determination. these and other features of the context of offers must be taken into account when considering whether it was reasonable or not to accept an offer, no matter how close to the ultimate result the offer may be. pennisi was cited with approval by the full court in alston & alston [2021] fedcfamc1a 96 (\u2018alston\u2019) at [101]. i adopt the observations of application of section 117 of the act in griffiths, pennisi and alston. husband\u2019s offer \u2013 wife to receive 50% of [the property] sale proceeds the husband\u2019s offer was made on friday 28 august 2020 and was open until 9am on monday 31 august 2020. the husband clarified an error to a key term of the offer, namely the division of the [b] street property sale proceeds in the event of a sale, at 4:59pm on friday 28 august 2020. in other words, the husband\u2019s offer as first put remained open for a period of less than one business day. the husband\u2019s offer, as corrected, was not open to the wife during business hours at all. the full court in alston & alston [2021] fedcfamc1a 96 at paragraph 106 refers to a useful summary of the principles of calderbank offers. in that context, \u201c[t]he factors relevant to the question whether a rejection of an offer is unreasonable include whether the offeree had an adequate opportunity to enable it to consider and deal with the offer\u201d. in putting an offer that lapsed within less than one business day, the husband would have been well aware that he was not providing any adequate opportunity for the wife to consider or deal with his offer, nor could she receive any meaningful legal advice in relation to his offer. the wife submits that an offer put in those terms does not properly form the basis of an order for costs. application of section 117 the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings legal aid the conduct of the parties to the proceedings whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure to comply with an order of the court whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings whether any party has made an offer in writing to

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 14 july 2023 federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2) oglesby & oglesby (no 2) [2023] fedcfamc2f 566 orders the court orders that: any document which has been called for in these proceedings, (b) any offer\u2019s to be made by her and/or to be considered that have been made by the husband. any offer\u2019s to be made by her and/or to be considered that have been made by the husband. ex-tempore reasons for judgment judge turnbull background shortly thereafter, i attended a meeting with [mr oglesby] and other persons who were introduced to me as representatives of [t ltd]. i attended the meeting as [mr oglseby] had asked me to be present to support him. [t ltd] holds an australian financial services licence, and their licence underpinned the registration of [r company] as a managed investment scheme. during the meeting, a conversation to the following effect took place: [t ltd] rep: \"we are concerned about the allegations [ms oglesby] made. even though they are false, they are clearly damaging. we are withdrawing the scheme, and consent to use our licence.\" \"[ms oglesby] has contacted us directly on a number of occasions. she has demanded to know what funds had been generated by [r company], despite there not being any. she made several accusations about [mr oglesby]. she asserted that she and other investors had lost funds in [r company]. we have a professional reputation to preserve and we cannot be associated with any appearance of impropriety. it is relevant,[2] and (b) the words attributed to the t ltd representative were first-hand hearsay and can be received pursuant to section 66a of the evidence act 1995 (cth) (\u2018the evidence act\u2019), as an exception to the hearsay rule \u2014 that is, the representation evidences the state of mind of the t ltd representative and t ltd, and explains why t ltd withdrew from the managed investment scheme and no longer consented to the use of their license. the words attributed to the t ltd representative were first-hand hearsay and can be received pursuant to section 66a of the evidence act 1995 (cth) (\u2018the evidence act\u2019), as an exception to the hearsay rule \u2014 that is, the representation evidences the state of mind of the t ltd representative and t ltd, and explains why t ltd withdrew from the managed investment scheme and no longer consented to the use of their license. alternatively, it was argued that the evidence should be received de bene esse and i should rule on the issue upon the completion of mr s\u2019s evidence. consideration evidence of a previous representation made by a person is not admissible to prove the existence of a fact that it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert by the representation. (2) such a fact is in this part referred to as an asserted fact. (2a) for the purposes of determining under subsection (1) whether it can reasonably be supposed that the person intended to assert a particular fact by the representation, the court may have regard to the circumstances in which the representation was made. a reference in this division (other than in subsection (2)) to a previous representation is a reference to a previous representation that was made by a person who had personal knowledge of an asserted fact. (2) a person has personal knowledge of an asserted fact if his or her knowledge of the fact was, or might reasonably be supposed to have been, based on something that the person saw, heard or otherwise perceived, other than a representation made by another person about the fact. (3) for the purposes of 66a a person has personal knowledge of the asserted fact if it is a fact about the person\u2019s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind at the time the representation referred to in that section was made. this section applies in a civil proceeding if a person who made a previous representation is not available to give evidence about an asserted fact. (2) the hearsay rule does not apply to: (a) evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or (b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation. evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made, or (b) a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation. a document so far as it contains the representation, or another representation to which it is reasonably necessary to refer in order to understand the representation. the hearsay rule does not apply to: (a) evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made. evidence of the representation that is given by a person who saw, heard or otherwise perceived the representation being made. the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made by a person if the representation was a contemporaneous representation about a person\u2019s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind. (emphasis added) the union objects to the admissibility of evidence to be given on behalf of boral by neil phillips. mr phillips is a boral account manager with responsibility for customers in the ballarat region. he managed the account of town and country, a concrete placer, in relation to construction projects at werribee plaza and ballarat aquatic centre. the evidence concerns two groups of conversations between him and representatives of town and country. in the first group of conversations, mr phillips evidence would be that the part-owner of town and country, liam kinniburgh, and its estimator, tim knowles, told him that the concrete supply contract for the werribee plaza had all but been awarded to boral. after the quotation process was completed, mr kinniburgh said that boral had offered the best price and finalisation of the sale was underway. after the union bans were implemented, mr kinniburgh said that town and country could not use boral because of the bans. the contract was awarded to another supplier. mr phillips would also depose that mr kinniburgh told him that mr kinniburgh had been told by a shop steward of the site builder not to use boral and he told the shop steward that he would not do so. it can be seen that mr phillips\u2019 evidence in this respect contains double-hearsay. the second group of conversations concern the ballarat aquatic centre. mr phillips\u2019 evidence would be that mr kinniburgh told him that boral would be awarded the concrete supply contract. just prior to the commencement of the pour, mr kinniburgh told mr phillips that town and country would not be using boral because the union did not want it on site. this contract too was awarded to another supplier. boral witnesses have given, and will be giving, some evidence of this kind without objection in circumstances where it will be leading direct evidence from the customers about them not using boral because of the union bans. the union is not objecting to evidence of boral witnesses about what customers told boral in this respect where the customers themselves will be giving evidence. it is only objecting to evidence of this kind from boral witnesses where the customer will not be doing so. the ground of objection is hearsay and, in the one case, double-hearsay. boral relies upon the exception to the hearsay rule specified in s 66a of the evidence act 2008 (vic). section 66a provides the hearsay rule does not apply to evidence of a previous representation made by a person if the representation was a contemporaneous representation about the person\u2019s health, feelings, sensations, intention, knowledge or state of mind. the exception in this provision applies in civil and criminal proceedings to first-hand hearsay evidence of contemporaneous representations by persons about their health etc. the operation of the exception is well illustrated by the classic case of evidence of fears expressed by a murdered wife about her husband\u2019s violence and her intention to leave him. first-hand hearsay evidence of the words and actions of the deceased expressing these feelings and intentions are usually admissible in the trial of criminal charges against the husband. the fact that the evidence is hearsay evidence goes to weight, not admissibility. the evidence might be subject to discretionary exclusion, but that is not relevant here. boral submits that mr phillips\u2019 evidence would be of the contemporaneous intention and state of mind of town and county with respect to the awarding of the concrete supply contracts to boral and then not doing so because of the union bans. it relies upon this evidence in relation to the issues of causation and quantum. it does not do so as evidence of the bans as these are taken to have been admitted by reason of the default judgment. the evidence of the conversations in the two groups would be of what town and country representatives told mr phillips about both its intention to award the contracts to boral and its intention not to do so by reason of the bans. in terms of s 66a, the evidence would be of town and country\u2019s contemporaneous intention and state of mind in relation to awarding and not awarding the contracts to boral. despite being first-hand hearsay, that provision would apply to make the evidence admissible if it is relevant to issues in the trial. it would be so relevant because causation and quantum are issues in the trial. as i have said, that the evidence is hearsay goes to weight, not admissibility, and discretionary exclusion does not arise. on analysis, the conversation containing the double-hearsay stands in the same category but upon the basis that the evidence is admissible in relation to town and country\u2019s intention and state of mind, not in relation to what the shop steward said. mr phillips\u2019 evidence of what mr kinneburgh told him was said to mr kinniburgh by the shop steward is not covered by s 66a because it is double hearsay. but mr phillips\u2019 evidence of what mr kinniburgh told him is further first-hand hearsay evidence of town and country\u2019s intention and state of mind with respect to not awarding the contract to boral by reason of the union bans and, in that respect, is covered by s 66a. it too is relevant to causation and quantum.[4] (emphasis added) i therefore overrule the objections and admit the evidence. the document could not be admitted under section 72, having failed to satisfy the relevance test under section 55. however, the document would not have become admissible under section 72 in any event. assuming the words \u201cbut must take mark with me to asc\u201d could be treated as evidence of the appellant\u2019s intention as to \u2013 as at the time he wrote in the pad, evidence of the appellant\u2019s intention at the time of writing did not go to a fact in issue.[5] (emphasis added) issues thus arise as to whether any or all of the contents of the letters may fall within the exception provided for in s 66a. they will only do so if they constitute first-hand hearsay and are contemporaneous in the necessary sense. insofar as the letters express opinions other issues arise under ss 76 and 79 of the evidence act. mr shtifelman does not assert that he has personal knowledge of the matters which are dealt with in the two letters. the representations in the letters are the representations of the authors who, at least to the extent that the representations relate to facts, such as where in the world programmes are distributed, may be assumed to be matters within the personal knowledge of the respective authors. mr shtifelman can thus be seen to be giving evidence that the authors, who had the relevant personal knowledge, had represented that certain facts existed. the contents of the letters, about which mr shtifelman gave evidence, thus constitute, at best for the applicants, second-hand hearsay. they are not rendered admissible by s 66a of the evidence act. section 66a provides that a representation may be admissible if it was a \u201ccontemporaneous representation\u201d about the state of mind of the person making it. this begs the question: contemporaneous with what? the answer, in general terms, is: contemporaneous with the act to which the representation relates and which it is sought to establish.[6] (emphasis added) subsequently, in the nsw court of appeal, two members of the court appeared to approve the notion that inability to cross-examine on material sought to be introduced is not of itself unfairly prejudicial, at least in civil proceedings where there is no jury, even though that inability may well be a very relevant consideration in the court's decision as to the weight it should ultimately afford to the evidence. certainly, if the impossibility of challenging the veracity of hearsay statements by non-witnesses were generally to justify, or were often to be a significant factor in justifying, a decision to exclude evidence in the court's discretion, the result would be to write the hearsay exceptions out of the act to a large extent. that outcome would be contrary to the legislative intention. on the other hand, the balancing exercise involved in the discretion gives courts considerable flexibility. the nsw court of appeal has reaffirmed the power of a court to exclude evidence where the opposing party is unable to cross-examine. similarly, the nsw court of criminal appeal has recognised that an inability to cross-examine can significantly reduce the probative value of the evidence and cause prejudice to the opponent. it would appear that the proper approach is to assess the significance of the inability to cross-examine in the particular circumstances of the case. in r v suteski (2002) 56 nswlr 182, 137 a crim r 371, [2002] nswcca 509 at [126]\u2013[127] wood cj at cl observed: i see no reason why the inability ... to cross-examine ... should not have been relevant for s 135 and s 137 of the evidence act. however, the bare fact that a defendant cannot cross-examine a witness is not necessarily decisive of the issue which arises in relation to these provisions. see ordukaya v hicks [2000] nswca 180, bakerland pty ltd v coleridge [2002] nswca 30, and in particular the decision of heydon ja in r v clark (2001) 123 a crim r 506, [2001] nswcca 494 at para 164. the decisions mentioned clearly depend upon their particular facts, that is, upon the character of the evidence involved and upon the nature or strength of the potential prejudice to the defendant. each case, in my view, needs to be examined individually by reference to the well understood balancing exercise. these propositions were subsequently endorsed in galvin v the queen (2006) 161 a crim r 449, [2006] nswcca 66 at [40] per howie j (mcclellan cj at cl and latham j agreeing). in alrc 102, it was stated at para 16.45: the commissions acknowledge that there has been uncertainty as to whether unfair prejudice can arise from procedural considerations. as noted above, one of the objects of these provisions is to prevent the tribunal of fact from being exposed to evidence that is likely to mislead it or play upon its emotions or prejudices. in the interim report for the previous evidence inquiry, the alrc referred not only to unfair prejudice arising from evidence which might inflame emotions, but also to unfair prejudice resulting from mis-estimation by the fact-finder of the weight to be given to particular evidence. an inability to test the reliability of evidence may carry with it the danger of such mis-estimation. it is therefore consistent with the policy basis for this discretion that the inability to test evidence may constitute a legitimate ground for its exclusion where this will affect the ability of the fact-finder to assess rationally the weight of the evidence. of course, there is \u201cno property in a witness\u201d and an opposing party may be able to call the person who made the representation as a witness. in those circumstances, it would be appropriate to consider whether that person may be questioned by the opposing party prior to giving evidence and whether leading questions of the witness may be permissible in examination-in-chief.

[y] visited [ms jessen] from 30 september to 3 october [2021], i saw [y] on 3 occasions. at no stage that i observed [y] to have any anxiety or fear of her mother, brother or me or any other member of her family. in fact the exact opposite was true as [y] behaved in a relaxed and normal way. noticeably, what did stand out to me was that this has been the first time in 18 months that [y] has been allowed by her father to stay with [ms jessen] for more than 2 days in a row. as [y] stayed with [ms jessen] for nearly 4 days, over the course of the longer time i saw a different [y], who transitioned from being guarded and petulant to becoming engaged with her mother, brother, extended family and her friends. ...implement any routines, discipline or chores as quote in his parenting of [x] and [y] follow spending time in the father\u2019s household. i recall being concerned when i witnessed [mr whitehouse] showing [y] violent footage of animals being slaughtered. in july 2015, i recall [mr whitehouse] had just informed the children that his mother, their grandmother, had died. soon after i saw [mr whitehouse] and [y] at [mr whitehouse]\u2019s computer, [y] was wide-eyed and visibly shaken. [mr whitehouse] was showing [y] video footage of [animals being killed], after which [mr whitehouse] said \u201csee this is what people do\u201d. the evidence of family consultant ms n \u2013 family report dated 4 august 2021 and cross examination whitehouse] said that, ideally, he would love for [x] to live with him or spend more time with him. however, he said that [x] is not able to spend more time with him on the [region ag] because it is yet to be safe for [r], [s] and [t] [sic], who live with him more than half the time. he seemed to suggest that upon [x] having completed his therapy to address his impulsivity and his sexualised behaviours, it may be possible for [x] to spend more time with him, if it has been assessed as appropriate by [x] therapist. whitehouse] advocated strongly for [y] to repair and have a positive relationship with [ms jessen] because he believes that this relationship is important for [y]. the family consultant raised with [mr whitehouse] at discrepancies about his account of [y]\u2019s year, compared to both [y]\u2019s account, and [ms jessen]\u2019s account. in response to this, [mr whitehouse] said that [y] has had a \u201chorrific year with her mother\u201d (which shocked the family consultant). [mr whitehouse] (now) appeared to hold a substantially more alarming view about [y]\u2019s time with [ms jessen]. in a nonchalant manner, he suggested that such time has generally been an extremely negative and harmful experience for [y]. it was very confusing and concerning to the family consultant, that [mr whitehouse] had not raised such concerns much earlier in his interview, when such questions were asked. when the discrepancy of his account of [y]\u2019s time with [ms jessen] was raised by the family consultant, [mr whitehouse] made an attempt to explain this, however his explanation was not able to be followed by the family consultant. as part of his explanation, he appeared to indicate that he and [y] \u201csuck it up\u201d to comply with the interim orders. he further suggested that [y] spending time with [ms jessen] was to [y]\u2019s detriment. raised no serious concerns in either [ms jessen] saw [mr whitehouse]\u2019s care. [x] described the different parenting and households. at his mother\u2019s house, he said that there are \u201chigh expectations\u201d (about school, rules and behaviour was bracket. he described his father\u2019s house as \u201cmore chilled\u201d the game time allowed unconditionally. [x] said that he is expected to undertake tours in both households, though disappeared more so at his mother\u2019s house stop\u201d 8] [y] said that her mental health started to deteriorate in 2017 when she encountered some difficulties in her relationships with both her mother and [x] and how they treated her. [y] said that some of [x]\u2019s past behaviours to her (which have made her feel comfortable) are that he licks her feet and \u201ccan\u2019t take his hands off me\u201d. she said that she has felt unsafe when [x] has significant meltdowns (requiring police assistance) and when [x] touched her when they were in bed together. regarding her mother\u2019s behaviour towards her, [y] said that [ms jessen] \u201cgets mad at me and tells me off\u201d. she alleged that [ms jessen] has pinned her down to the bed and not let her leave when she has wanted to. [y] said that [x] \u201chas always been the favourite\u201d child in the maternal home because of his additional needs. she commented that [ms jessen] \u201chas always made excuses for him\u201d. she said that [x] is \u201calways in my space\u201d and that this is dismissed by [ms jessen], saying to her \u201c[x] has issues, it\u2019s not his fault\u201d. [139] [y] said that her mother stopping time with her father \u201cfor no reason\u201d for a period (november 2019 \u2013 march 2020), caused her acute psychological distress and which resulted in a few suicide attempts. [y] has also said that her mother unfairly blamed her father for her lack of time spent with him ([y] said that she was told by [ms jessen] that her father was not seeing her because he refused to the sign the parenting agreement). [y] said that not seeing her father over this five-month period caused her to have a \u201cmental breakdown\u201d. [140] when [y] was asked about her relationship with [ms jessen], she launched into telling the family consultant her concerns, being that her mother, has accused her of having an eating disorder, is controlling, denied her support when she told her that [x] had touched her inappropriately, is always yelling and shouting at her, and that she is scared of her mother and of [x]. [y] said that most difficult aspect for her when in her mother\u2019s past care, has been [ms jessen]\u2019s alleged minimisation of her suicidal ideation and dismissal of her concerns about not feeling safe in her mother\u2019s care. [141] [y] said that, by the easter school holidays of 2020, she resumed spending time with [mr whitehouse] and desired to remain in his care. [y] said that she when was made to return to her mother\u2019s care (against her wishes), that her mental health \u201cexploded\u201d and that she then spent the weekend in an adolescent mental health ward. [y] said that following this, her mother agreed to allow her to keep her phone with her and call her father whenever she needed. with this in place, [y] said she felt she was able to return to her mother\u2019s care. [y] said that in the car on the way home from the hospital, her mother then said that she would not allow her to have any of things that were agreed to whilst she was at the hospital. [y] said that her mother shouted at her the whole way home. [y] said that whilst in her mother\u2019s care after this, her suicidal ideation and self-harm thoughts escalated and she said that she needed to return to the care of her father for her psychological wellbeing. [y] indicated that it supported her mental health greatly when the interim orders were changed to accommodate her living with her father in june 2020. [142] [y] said that since she and [x] have lived separately their relationship has \u201cchanged for the better\u201d. she said that on their weekend together, [x] \u201cstill invades my space\u201d, though she said that this is less than what is was when they were living together. [y] said that, at times, she can still feel unsafe around [x] because she \u201cdoes not know where he is at\u201d. [y] explained this to mean that she had no update about [x]\u2019s progression of counselling for his sexualised behaviours. therefore, she has no knowledge if this has been addressed or remains a risk issue for her. [y] said that when she has asked [ms jessen] for information about this, [ms jessen] has told her that this is [x]\u2019s business. [144] regarding her weekends with [ms jessen], [y] said that she \u201cdreaded these\u201d and that the only positive about these weekends for her was seeing [x]. [y] said that her mother can \u201close control\u201d and \u201cbecome aggressive\u201d towards her. she said that in the past, [ms jessen] has grabbed her wrists and forced her down to sit on the couch. [y] said that her mother\u2019s behaviour scared her, and she has told her mother that she needed to go the police station to be safe. [y] said that this further escalated [ms jessen]\u2019s loss of control and that she \u201cfroze\u201d. [y] reflected that this incident greatly concerns her, as she knew she needed support and safety but she was unable to act on this, seemingly overcome with fear at the time. [y] said that her mother is \u201cunable to control her temper\u201d. [145] [y] said that, when in her mother\u2019s care, [ms jessen] \u201cdemands\u201d that [y] eats a non-vegan diet. [y] said that her mother wants her to have a bone density test because of her choice to be a vegan, which she said her mother is staunchly opposed too. [y] said that her mother has accused her of having an eating disorder, that she is forced to watch documentaries about eating disorders and that her mother forces her to eat meat. [y] spoke about being an ethical vegan, and eating healthy and ethically sourced foods. [y] said that she eats well and that this should be supported by her mother, as this is her right to choose and follow such a lifestyle. [y] suggested that a substantial source of her conflict with [ms jessen], as well as how her mother treats her, is related to her veganism. [146] [y] said that on her last weekend with her mother, [ms jessen] made her read an article that suggested children having a vegan diet grow up to be shorter and skinnier than non-vegan children. [y] said that her mother accused her of having an eating disorder and was verbally attacking of her in front of her friend and other members of the public when they were at [as shopping centre]. [y] said that, during this incident, she began to cry and shake and that people passing by stopped to ask if she was ok. [y], tearfully, then said to the family consultant, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand how hard it is for me there, i don\u2019t want to be there\u201d. (spending time with [ms jessen]). [147] [y] had a clear view at the time of her family report interview, that she wants to spend no time with [ms jessen] because her mother is \u201cnot going to change her behaviour\u201d (towards her). she said that her mother is \u201calways yelling\u201d, \u201ccontrolling\u201d, critical of her body and her vegan lifestyle and \u201cforces me to eat meat\u201d. [y] said that [ms jessen] \u201cneeds help\u201d. [y] said that [ms jessen] interacts towards [x] in a similar way. she said that she is somewhat hopeful that family therapy may result in changes in her mother\u2019s behaviour towards her, so that she could spend some time with [ms jessen] in the future. [y] had a clear view that such time in the future, should only be limited to the daytime and that she should not be alone in her mother\u2019s care (suggesting [x] should also be present). [148] [y] reiterated in her interview, \u201ci\u2019m not safe, not at all, i don\u2019t get a say in anything\u201d (when in her mother\u2019s care). [y] suggested that her overall experience of [ms jessen] accumulates to \u201ctrauma\u201d for her, which she commented that she is still \u201cgoing through\u201d. [y] said that her relationship with her mother \u201cneeds help\u201d and she said she would like to have an improved relationship with [ms jessen]. [y] said that a concern about family therapy is that [ms jessen] will convince the therapist that [ms jessen]\u2019s narrative is the truth, over her narrative about her experience of her mother. [149] [y] had very strong views that she \u201chas a right\u201d to live with her father and she further asserted, \u201ci\u2019m safe there\u201d. [150] [y] appeared very shocked when the family consultant discussed the possibility of the court making final orders that she live with [ms jessen]. it appeared almost inconceivable to [y] that remaining in her father\u2019s care was questionable. [y] said that she would be scared if orders are made for her to live with her mother. she said that she cannot understand how such an arrangement is possible, based on her views about her safety. 9] [y] said that her mother stopping time with her father \u201cfor no reason\u201d for a period (november 2019 \u2013 march 2020), caused her acute psychological distress and which resulted in a few suicide attempts.

[150] [y] appeared very shocked when the family consultant discussed the possibility of the court making final orders that she live with [ms jessen]. it appeared almost inconceivable to [y] that remaining in her father\u2019s care was questionable. [y] said that she would be scared if orders are made for her to live with her mother. she said that she cannot understand how such an arrangement is possible, based on her views about her safety. 1] [y] said that, by the easter school holidays of 2020, she resumed spending time with [mr whitehouse] and desired to remain in his care. [y] said that she when was made to return to her mother\u2019s care (against her wishes), that her mental health \u201cexploded\u201d and that she then spent the weekend in an adolescent mental health ward. [y] said that following this, her mother agreed to allow her to keep her phone with her and call her father whenever she needed. with this in place, [y] said she felt she was able to return to her mother\u2019s care. [y] said that in the car on the way home from the hospital, her mother then said that she would not allow her to have any of things that were agreed to whilst she was at the hospital. [y] said that her mother shouted at her the whole way home. [y] said that whilst in her mother\u2019s care after this, her suicidal ideation and self-harm thoughts escalated and she said that she needed to return to the care of her father for her psychological wellbeing. [y] indicated that it supported her mental health greatly when the interim orders were changed to accommodate her living with her father in june 2020. [142] [y] said that since she and [x] have lived separately their relationship has \u201cchanged for the better\u201d. she said that on their weekend together, [x] \u201cstill invades my space\u201d, though she said that this is less than what is was when they were living together. [y] said that, at times, she can still feel unsafe around [x] because she \u201cdoes not know where he is at\u201d. [y] explained this to mean that she had no update about [x]\u2019s progression of counselling for his sexualised behaviours. therefore, she has no knowledge if this has been addressed or remains a risk issue for her. [y] said that when she has asked [ms jessen] for information about this, [ms jessen] has told her that this is [x]\u2019s business. [144] regarding her weekends with [ms jessen], [y] said that she \u201cdreaded these\u201d and that the only positive about these weekends for her was seeing [x]. [y] said that her mother can \u201close control\u201d and \u201cbecome aggressive\u201d towards her. she said that in the past, [ms jessen] has grabbed her wrists and forced her down to sit on the couch. [y] said that her mother\u2019s behaviour scared her, and she has told her mother that she needed to go the police station to be safe. [y] said that this further escalated [ms jessen]\u2019s loss of control and that she \u201cfroze\u201d. [y] reflected that this incident greatly concerns her, as she knew she needed support and safety but she was unable to act on this, seemingly overcome with fear at the time. [y] said that her mother is \u201cunable to control her temper\u201d. [145] [y] said that, when in her mother\u2019s care, [ms jessen] \u201cdemands\u201d that [y] eats a non-vegan diet. [y] said that her mother wants her to have a bone density test because of her choice to be a vegan, which she said her mother is staunchly opposed too. [y] said that her mother has accused her of having an eating disorder, that she is forced to watch documentaries about eating disorders and that her mother forces her to eat meat. [y] spoke about being an ethical vegan, and eating healthy and ethically sourced foods. [y] said that she eats well and that this should be supported by her mother, as this is her right to choose and follow such a lifestyle. [y] suggested that a substantial source of her conflict with [ms jessen], as well as how her mother treats her, is related to her veganism. [146] [y] said that on her last weekend with her mother, [ms jessen] made her read an article that suggested children having a vegan diet grow up to be shorter and skinnier than non-vegan children. [y] said that her mother accused her of having an eating disorder and was verbally attacking of her in front of her friend and other members of the public when they were at [as shopping centre]. [y] said that, during this incident, she began to cry and shake and that people passing by stopped to ask if she was ok. [y], tearfully, then said to the family consultant, \u201cyou don\u2019t understand how hard it is for me there, i don\u2019t want to be there\u201d. (spending time with [ms jessen]). [147] [y] had a clear view at the time of her family report interview, that she wants to spend no time with [ms jessen] because her mother is \u201cnot going to change her behaviour\u201d (towards her). she said that her mother is \u201calways yelling\u201d, \u201ccontrolling\u201d, critical of her body and her vegan lifestyle and \u201cforces me to eat meat\u201d. [y] said that [ms jessen] \u201cneeds help\u201d. [y] said that [ms jessen] interacts towards [x] in a similar way. she said that she is somewhat hopeful that family therapy may result in changes in her mother\u2019s behaviour towards her, so that she could spend some time with [ms jessen] in the future. [y] had a clear view that such time in the future, should only be limited to the daytime and that she should not be alone in her mother\u2019s care (suggesting [x] should also be present). [148] [y] reiterated in her interview, \u201ci\u2019m not safe, not at all, i don\u2019t get a say in anything\u201d (when in her mother\u2019s care). [y] suggested that her overall experience of [ms jessen] accumulates to \u201ctrauma\u201d for her, which she commented that she is still \u201cgoing through\u201d. [y] said that her relationship with her mother \u201cneeds help\u201d and she said she would like to have an improved relationship with [ms jessen].

[y] is adamant that she remained living with [mr whitehouse]. it appeared in almost impossibility for [y] to resume spending time, by having future time with [ms jessen] because it is \u201cunsafe\u201d her to be in her mother\u2019s current care. [y] had very strong views that time with her mother is not able to even be considered, until substantial changes are made by [ms jessen] (about how her mother treats and parents are)... 3] ... even with the repair of [y]\u2019s and [ms jessen]\u2019s relationship, it does not appear realistic that [y] returned to live with [ms jessen] and [x] at a later stage in her adolescence. it appeared that for [y], her required parenting arrangement is with the father and she be raised primarily within the family unit of [mr whitehouse], [ms b] and her children, as these are very significant important relationships for her. ... somewhat aligned to her father, caused by [y]\u2019s perception, or possible experience, of her mother\u2019s shortcomings in a parenting, resulting in [y] feeling unsafe and abused. ...there would appear to be a great risk of serious mental health implications for [y], in the event that ... orders are made against [y]\u2019s wishes. the family consultant considers that [y] is very unlikely to comply with such an order. it is therefore recommended that [y] remain in [mr whitehouse]\u2019s care. i think that if she is to live with her dad in the [region ag], that may be of benefit to [y] if she did week on/week off, to have regular access to also her social life and school friends every other week in the school holidays, so she is not substantially missing out on time up there. ...if the parents are still having problems communicating and in the co-parenting relationship, then family therapy would still be recommended. the law whether the child spending equal time with each parent would be in the best interest of the child,[15] and (b) whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[16] whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[16] a discretionary judgment concerning the parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[18] ] in considering an allegation of sexual abuse, the court should not make a positive finding that the allegation is true unless the court is so satisfied according to the civil standard of proof, with due regard to the factors mentioned in briginshaw v briginshaw [1938] hca 34, (1938) 60 clr 336 at 362 ...

[72] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said: ] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said: ] the latter said: risk assessment in any situation involves, in essence, the asking of the following questions: (1) what harmful outcome is potentially present in this situation? (2) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (3) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (4) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (5) what measures are available whose deployment could mitigate the risks that are probable? (b. mahendra, 'psychiatric risk assessment in family and child law' (2008) 38 family law 569). ] mr fogarty, writing in the australian journal of family law said this (20 ajfl 249 at 254-5): ... the reality is that all courts deal with issues of \"risk\" and degrees of risk (however described) in various situations and that concept is increasingly used in legislation. risk is difficult to define in a way which is not ultimately circular. but it is an inevitable part of life at all its levels. it is inherently risky to breathe, eat, drink, walk, drive, work, invest and play. the world is full of different risks and consequences and everyone is prone to dangers. we confront varying levels of risk everyday. people frequently face potentially dangerous situations, not many live at home in complete isolation to avoid getting in harms way. most people try to avoid what they perceive to be risk, some willingly take on high risk activities. risk involves two component, the degree of \"likelihood\" of the happening of an event, and the possible consequences (good or bad) if it does [cases and citations omitted]. individuals in their assessment of some risks may focus more on one than the other of these components. but at some point it usually becomes necessary for that person to make a judgment of the risk and whether it can/should be taken. where the risk relates to a third person to whom one owes a responsibility, it is likely in the nature of things that the estimate will be conservative. risks are relative and usually involve trade-offs. crossing the road with oncoming traffic to catch the last connection to the airport involves the risk of being hit by a car or the risk of missing the plane. very much a balancing exercise of facts, experience and intuition, but essentially which risk carries the greater detriment (usually the car). then there is the common experience of a mother watching her child cross a road to go to school. the risk is seen as greater (although it may not be) because the consequences may be death or injury to the child and because the responsibilities of the mother will be seen by her as greater than for herself or another adult .... at times the courts and the legislature have attempted to give an indication of the content or quality of the risk -- otherwise \u201crisk\u201d may mean any risk, however small or unlikely. hence the use of adjectives such as \u201cserious\u201d, \u201cgrave\u201d, \u201creal\u201d, \u201cappreciable\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d. ] i respectfully agree, as i also do with mr fogarty's statement (which also has echoes in the english author's statement earlier quoted) that: ... unacceptable risk in the high court's formulation [in m v m (1988) 166 clr 69] requires two separate steps. is there a risk, and is it unacceptable? the concentration by the high court is upon both the nature and the degree of risk in the particular case. its formulation is all about balance. in some cases a risk is \"acceptable\" when balanced against other factors and other orders. the object of safeguards is to convert an unacceptable situation to an acceptable one where that is feasible and is of \"benefit to the child\". it is, as i suggested earlier, calibrated to its use in individual cases. it is unrelated to the exoneration or otherwise of the alleged abuser, it is all about the bests interests of the child and protection from risk section 60cc \u2013 the primary considerations ... it will be in [y]\u2019s best interest to re-establish a relationship of trust, openness and emotional closeness with [ms jessen]. [y] has specific and emotionally triggering memories of interactions with her mother that is currently negatively impacting on her sense of trust and feeling safe when she is with her mother. my recommendation would be to continue with counselling to ensure a sense of safety for [y] and to increase the time spent with her mother over time. i would however strongly recommend that she is given an opportunity to participate in establishing a program of increased time with her mother is forcing her to comply with spending increased time will most probably be detrimental to her mental health. section 60cc \u2013 the additional considerations. any views expressed by y and any factors (such as y\u2019s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to y\u2019s views 7] ... that she wants to spend no time with [ms jessen] because the mother is \u2018not going to change her behaviour\u2019 (towards her). ..... she said that she is somewhat hopeful that family therapy may result in changes in her mother\u2019s behaviour towards her, so that she could spend some time with [ms jessen] in the future. [y] had a clear view that such time in the future, should only be limited to the daytime and that she should not be alone in her mother\u2019s care (suggesting [x] should also be present). the nature of the relationship of y with each of her parents and with other persons. the extent to which each of y\u2019s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to y, to spend time with y, and to communicate with y. the extent to which each of y\u2019s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent\u2019s obligations to maintain y. the likely effect of any changes in y\u2019s circumstances, including the likely effect on y of any separation from either of her parents, or any other child, or other person with whom she has been living. the practical difficulty and expense of y spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect y\u2019s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis. the capacity of each of y\u2019s parents and any other person to provide for the needs of y, including her emotional and intellectual needs. the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of y and of either of y\u2019s parents, and any other characteristics of y that the court thinks are relevant. the attitude to y, and the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of y\u2019s parents. parental responsibility \u2013section 61da section 65daa - equal time, or substantial and significant time? is it in y\u2019s best interest to spend substantial and significant time with each of the parents? what orders are determined to be proper to be made in y\u2019s best interests with her interests as the paramount consideration are proper to be made. concluding remarks associate: dated: 24 april 2023 dated: 24 april 2023 [1] exhibit iclb14.[2] transcript 8 november 2021 page 7, lines 3 to 28.[3] exhibit a6.[4] exhibit r1.[5] exhibit r3, 41.[6] this entity is now known as the department of communities and justice.[7] exhibit iclb6.[8] exhibit \u201cir1\u201d, part \u201cc\u201d to mother\u2019s affidavit dated 14 october 2021.[9] exhibit r6, 229, 232.[10] exhibit r5, 187.[11] original emphasis.[12] exhibit iclb14.[13] family law act 1975 (cth) s 65d(2).[14] family law act 1975 (cth) s 61da(4).[15] family law act 1975 (cth) s 65daa(1)(a).[16] family law act 1975 (cth) s 65daa(1)(b).[17] family law act 1975 (cth) s 65daa(1)(c).[18] grella & jamieson [2017] famcafc 21, [18].[19] exhibit a6.", "metadata": {"filename": "907.txt", "size": 139903, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 141516, "document_id": "907"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "907_chunk_0"}}

husband\u2019s local court criminal proceedings (2020/00369683 & 2020/00369638). 3. the husband\u2019s costs application in respect of the application in a case is listed for hearing at 2.15pm on 16 december 2021. reasons for judgment judge betts 1 these reasons for judgment were delivered orally. they have been corrected from the transcript so as to make them easier to read. overview: 2 i have before me an application in a case filed by james robert grimley (the husband) which seeks specific relief pursuant to section 121(9)(g) of the family law act 1975, and rule 14.11 of the federal circuit court rules 2001. specifically, he seeks that his affidavit filed 10 march 2021 and the wife's affidavit filed 21 april 2021 in their earlier property settlement proceedings in this court, be \u201cpublished\u201d in the husband's local court criminal proceedings involving the wife. 3 the wife, ms adair, is the respondent to this application. her belated position is that it is an entirely unnecessarily application which need never have been brought as the husband could as of right have done the things that he now seeks the court to sanction. 4 the case raises some interesting points, and i was much assisted by the written submissions of ms court of counsel on behalf of the husband, and the written submissions of ms mahony of counsel on behalf of the wife. i was also assisted by the oral submissions and the socratic dialogue in which we engaged at the hearing, and i appreciate counsel's assistance in that respect. 5 by way of very brief overview, the property settlement proceedings between the parties were commenced by the husband on 3 march 2021. the wife filed response material on 21 april 2021. relevantly, her response material alleged various instances of family violence perpetrated by the father against her. the parties subsequently engaged in a mediation, and on 6 august 2021, a registrar of this court finalised the property settlement proceedings by consent. 6 throughout the course of the property proceedings, the husband was facing serious criminal charges in respect of alleged violence towards the wife, the subject of her affidavit material in this court. in particular, he was facing - and still faces - four (4) counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, and one count of intimidation. the offences are inherently serious. they carry a maximum penalty of two years imprisonment and/or fines up to $5,500 if prosecuted in the jurisdiction of the local court. that is a penalty, to be clear, which applies in respect of each and every count alleged. 7 the husband points to what he says are various inconsistencies between what the wife has alleged in her affidavit material and what she has told police in a recorded interview. logically, for the purpose of defending his criminal proceedings, he wishes to be able to rely upon what he says are the wife\u2019s prior inconsistent statements (in this court). 8 the real question in the case is whether or not the husband in fact needed to bring the application. it is an interesting case in that the wife, having contended that the husband could have published or otherwise used the affidavits as of right in the local court, does not oppose the application in terms of its merits. rather, she claims that the application is not one that was strictly required by reference to the relevant law. accordingly, the debate was very much a legal one rather than a factual one. 9 to that end i permitted the wife to read and rely upon very late filed material, which in any event largely goes to questions of costs save for the submissions made by her counsel which do go to the substantive legal questions. husband\u2019s application under section 121 of the family law act: 10 i start with section 121 of the family law act, which is the more straightforward issue. 11 pursuant to section 121(1), a specific statutory offence is created in respect of a party who \u201cpublishes\u201d in a newspaper or periodical publication by radio broadcast, television or by any other electronic means, or who other otherwise disseminates to the public or a section of the public by any means, any account of any proceedings or part of a proceedings which identifies a party or a witness, commits an offence punishable upon conviction by imprisonment for a period not exceeding one (1) year. 12 pursuant to section 121(9)(a), the preceding provisions of the section - including subsection (1) - do not apply in relation to: \u201ca communication to persons concerned in proceedings in any court of any pleading, transcript of evidence or other document for use in connection with those proceedings.\u201d 13 ms court, on behalf of the husband, contended that section 121(9)(a) did not necessarily provide a complete protection to the husband in respect of that section, and that it was prudent and appropriate for me to make a specific order pursuant to section 121(9)(g), which is a separate exception which permits publication \"where the accounts of proceedings have been approved by the court\". 14 on a plain reading of section 121(9)(a), i do not consider it necessary for me to make any specific order pursuant to section 121(9)(g). in my view, the use by the husband in the local court of the documents he seeks permission to publish is in every respect a \u201cpublication\u201d that is authorised by section 121(9)(a). 15 to that extent, the husband\u2019s application under section 121 need not have been made. husband\u2019s application for relief from the implied undertaking: 16 this is the more difficult question, namely whether it was necessary for the husband to seek leave to publish the documents pursuant to the court's rules. this arises on account of the fact that the publication of such documents in the local court is said to breach the implied undertaking given by parties to the court. 17 this implied undertaking is referred to in the english decision of harman v secretary of state for the home department [1983] 1 ac 280, and more recently re-stated by the high court of australia in hearne & street [2008] hca 36. 18 the husband\u2019s application in a case was filed on 1 september 2021, so it seems to me that rule 14.11 of the former federal circuit court rules does not apply, and indeed the application ought to be determined by reference to rule 6.04 of the federal circuit and family court of australia rules. the parties argued the matter before me on that basis, and i understand that although the husband's application refers to the former rule, it is to be read as referencing rule 6.04. 19 fcfcoa rule 6.04 is in sweeping terms. it provides: a person who inspects or copies a document in relation to a proceeding under these rules or an order: must use the document for the purpose of the proceeding only, and (b) must not otherwise disclose the content of the document, or give a copy of it, to any other person without the court's permission. 20 subrule (2) provides specific exceptions, namely that a solicitor may disclose the contents of a document, or give a copy of the document, to the solicitor's client or counsel, the client may do the same, and that the rule does not affect the right of a party to use a document or disclose its contents if the party has a common interest in the document with the party who has possession or control of it. 21 rule 6.04 is, in effect, a restatement of the harman, or perhaps more accurately, hearne & street obligation, for the purposes of proceedings in this court. the obligation was explained by hayne, heydon and crennan jj in hearne & street wherein their honours said at paragraphs 95 and 96 of their joint judgment: before turning to the appellant's submissions in relation to the extent and enforceability of the \"implied undertaking\", it is desirable to set out some background legal principles which were not in controversy. where one party to litigation is compelled, either by reason of a rule of court or by reason of a specific order of the court or otherwise to disclose documents or information, the party obtaining the disclosure cannot without the leave of the court use it for any purpose other than for which it was given unless it is received into evidence. the types of material disclosed to which this principle applies include documents inspected after discovery, answers to interrogatories, documents produced on subpoena, documents produced for the purposes of taxation of costs, documents produced pursuant to a direction from an arbitrator, documents seized pursuant to an anton piller order, witness statements served pursuant to a judicial direction and affidavits. 22 ms mahony contends that rule 6.04 has no application to affidavits, as distinct from documents produced under subpoena or otherwise by way of disclosure. she refers specifically to the fact that rule 6.04 appears within chapter 6 of the fcfcoa rules, entitled \u201cdisclosure and subpoenas\u201d. she also points to chapter 8, part 8.2 of the fcfcoa rules which relates to \u201cevidence\u201d and specifically contains various provisions concerning giving of evidence by affidavit. 23 ms mahony draws a distinction between a \u201cdocument\u201d falling within chapter 6, and an \u201caffidavit\u201d falling within chapter 8, part 8.2 of the rules. 24 such an argument is superficially attractive, and indeed ms mahony made eloquent submissions on the point. however, ultimately, i am unable to accept that submission. as the high court made clear in hearne & street, the ordinary obligation the subject of the implied undertaking can include documents that are not only discoverable but also affidavits. affidavits are an express category of document covered by the implied undertaking being discussed here. and in that regard, i also note that a party who brings an application such as the husband\u2019s property settlement application, is obliged to file a supporting affidavit. the wife was also obliged to serve an affidavit in support of her response. these are the affidavits which the husband seeks to be published in the local court. that is to say, the court\u2019s process (the relevant court rules) compelled the parties to file affidavits. in that sense i consider that although the affidavits are not strictly \"discoverable\" documents per se, that they nonetheless fall within the purview of fcfcoa rule 6.04, particularly given the extremely broad wording of the rule. 25 moreover, i would add that a party may by affidavit also choose to annexe discoverable documents that would otherwise ordinarily be provided pursuant to the ordinary provisions of part 6 of the fcfcoa rules. that is, an affidavit may contain documents that are inherently confidential but required to be disclosed for the purposes of the proceeding. 26 it is somewhat curious that fcfcoa rule 6.04 appears within chapter 6, but in my view it is a rule that has application to affidavits, it is not limited to documents that fall within specific categories set out in chapter 6. the language in rule 6.04 is so broad that i would be required to read it down to give it the meaning contended for by ms mahony, which i do not consider i ought to do having regard to the high court's decision in hearne & street, and to the longstanding law that the implied undertaking can capture affidavits. incompatibility between the implied undertaking & section 121? 27 a question arises as to whether section 121(9)(a) is inconsistent with the ongoing existence of an implied undertaking. that is, has section 121(9)(a) effectively overridden the implied undertaking by reason of the fact that the legislature has determined that documents may in fact be published in certain specified circumstances? 28 superficially there appears to be an inconsistency between the operation of s 121(9)(a) and the implied undertaking. but on further consideration, it is apparent that section 121 creates as specific statutory offence of publication, and then goes on to create specific exceptions. section 121 sits side by side with the so-called implied undertaking, and, in my view, no real incompatibility arises. have the relevant affidavits been adduced in evidence in the earlier proceedings, thus relieving the parties of the implied undertaking? 29 assuming the affidavits do in fact fall within the ambit of rule 6.04 (as i have found), another question that arises is whether the implied undertaking no longer applies on the basis of what the high court said in esso australia resources limited v plowman (1995) 183 clr 10 at 32, and particularly mason cj\u2019s observation that the implied undertaking is subject to the qualification that once material is \u201cadduced\u201d in evidence in court proceedings, then unless the court restrains publication of it, the material becomes part of the public domain (thus relieving the parties from the implied undertaking). 30 the question is whether the mere filing of the affidavit by the wife itself constitutes the admission of the document into evidence, or more precisely, it having been \u201creceived into evidence\u201d to borrow the expression of hayne, heydon and crennan jj in hearne & street? 31 ms court helpfully referred me to a decision of beech-jones j of the supreme court of new south wales: crawford & timms [2020] nswsc 380, in which his honour had to consider a very similar question to what i am asked to consider today. 32 his honour reviewed the relevant authorities, including hearne & street, and specifically the question of whether a document (otherwise the subject of the implied undertaking) had been \u201creceived into evidence\u201d in earlier proceedings. in that case, his honour permitted one of the parties to rely upon an affidavit that had been read in proceedings between the parties in the family court before mcclelland dcj. but his honour demurred in relation to whether or not financial statements that the wife had filed in those proceedings, but not read or tendered, were still the subject of the implied undertaking. his honour said there was doubt about that question, but in any event his honour rejected the tender of those financial statements for different reasons under section 135 of the evidence act. 33 his honour beech-jones j observed that the judgment of mason cj in esso made clear that once material is adduced in evidence in court proceedings, it becomes part of the public domain. in the context of whether or not it was relevant that the documents had been tendered in interlocutory applications (as distinct from a trial), his honour considered that the tender of material in open court, and material coming to the knowledge of the public, were two entirely different things. 34 so to be fair, the question was left open. 35 certainly, it is clear that courts need to be careful when it comes to the implied undertaking, because a breach of it is a contempt of court: so much was observed by beech-jones j in crawford & timms. his honour made the point that a breach of an implied undertaking has potentially serious consequences, and that the persons bound by such an undertaking should be able to ascertain with clarity when they are and when they are not bound by the undertaking. 36 the meaning of \u201cadduced\u201d - if it is different to \u201creceived in evidence\u201d - is somewhat unclear. ms court, by reference to the dictionary, said that \u201cadduce\u201d means to bring forward as argument or in evidence. this was not a definition that ms mahony opposed. her contention was that once the document had been filed in these proceedings, it had been effectively introduced into evidence, and in that sense, it is in the public domain, it is in the court proceedings. 37 i commend ms mahony's argument in terms of the point that parties give evidence in this court by affidavit, that is the ordinary basis upon which parties \u201cadduce evidence\u201d. but equally, it is the case that not every affidavit filed in proceedings ultimately ends up being read or relied upon, or even adduced in evidence at a trial or at a hearing. 38 i have no evidence before me which would demonstrate that the wife's affidavit of 21 april, or the husband's affidavit of 10 march, have, in fact, been adduced in evidence in the earlier property settlement proceedings. i specifically looked at the final order made by registrar clarke on 6 august 2021, and, in particular, on that order it is noted that in arriving at a decision, the registrar \u201chas considered a joint summary document signed by the parties' legal representatives and placed with the file\u201d. 39 i do not have that joint summary document before me, but it is always open to the parties to make concessions and to set out agreed facts in such a document, rather than to ask a registrar to read through the original affidavit evidence. there is nothing controversial about that practice, and that is clearly the way the parties proceeded here. 40 if the registrar had specifically been asked to consider the affidavits in question, then maybe it could be said that the affidavits had been \u201cadduced into evidence\u201d so as to relieve the husband of the implied undertaking. but i cannot come to that conclusion on the evidence before me. 41 in the circumstances, i am of the view that the husband does in fact need leave pursuant to fcfcoa rule 6.04 to release or publish the affidavits for the purposes of the local court proceedings, notwithstanding his entitlement to do so pursuant to section 121(9)(a) of the family law act. should leave be given here? 42 i turn lastly to the question of whether, in fact, the court should give leave to the husband. 43 this issue can be dealt with quite briefly as the wife did not agitate any particular argument on this issue - her case being that the application was unnecessary. 44 essentially it is necessary to establish that there are \u201cspecial circumstances\u201d for the discretion to be exercised, these need not be \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d. i accept the submissions made by ms court in this respect, and particularly what is set out at paragraph 28 and 29, and indeed 30 of her written submissions which are repeated below: 28. the principle outlined in liberty funding pty ltd -v- phoneix capital lid [2005] fcafc 3, (2005) 218 alr 283 (more particularly at [31], suggests that special circumstances must be shown before the discretion would be exercised, but special circumstances does not require extraordinary factors to be present: \u201cin order to be released from the implied undertaking it has been said that a party in the positions of the appellants must show \u2018special circumstances\u2019\u201d see, for example, springfield nominees pty ltd v bridge lands securities pty ltd (1992) 38f fcr 217. it is unnecessary to examine the authorities in this area in any detail. the parties were not in disagreement as to the legal principles. the notion of \u2018special circumstances\u2019 does not require that some extraordinary factors must bear on the question before the discretion will be exercised. it is sufficient to say that, in all the circumstances, good reason must be shown why, contrary to the usual position, documents produced or information obtained in on piece of litigation should be used for the advantage of a party in another piece of litigation or for other non-litigious purposes. the discretion is a broad one and all the circumstances of the case must be examined.\u201d 29. the documents sought pursuant to the application in a case are relevant to offering the applicant a proper defence through exposing the complainant\u2019s lack of credibility and reliability in the criminal proceedings. 30. where an application for release is decided in contested proceedings, it seems that special circumstances will fairly readily be found where it is established that the use of documents discovered in a proceeding is reasonably required for the purpose of doing justice between the parties in other proceedings: australian trade commission v mcmahon (1997) 73 fcr 211 at [217] per lehane j. 45 the husband is facing significant criminal charges. the public interest in ensuring that criminal justice is administered in a way as to ensure that no innocent person is convicted, in my view, is such that disclosure is appropriate for the purposes of the local court proceedings. i express no opinion as to what weight, if any, such documents may have to a magistrate, or what the result may be. i merely observe that the husband, in this case relevantly the accused, points to what he says are various inconsistencies which would presumably on his case establish a reasonable doubt as to his guilt. 46 the consequences of a conviction for the husband are obviously substantial, and this is not to say that i am oblivious also to the impact on the wife of giving evidence in local court proceedings, it would probably be a traumatic experience probably for all. 47 but in the circumstances of this case, i am of the view that the documents could be said to be reasonably required for the purpose of doing justice between the parties, there is a clear connection between the allegations made in this case and in that case, and that in all of the circumstances, the court should exercise its discretion in favour of the husband. associate: dated: 27 october 2021", "metadata": {"filename": "91.txt", "size": 21675, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 21853, "document_id": "91"}}, "outputs":

(d) while the mother agrees to undertake fortnightly cdt testing, there would potentially be periods where excessive consumption of alcohol by the mother would occur with x remaining in her care. i am not satisfied that this type, or indeed any type of testing regime, would sufficiently protect x. it was only during the interim hearing when questioned by me that the mother proffered that she would be undertaking alcohol treatment. this is at odds with her previous assertion that she does not have excessive alcohol consumption. i am not satisfied that the mother has any insight into the nature, extent and impact of her alcohol usage.

[mr manwaring] has instructed that he has no objections to the said property being sold. the proceeds can then be used to discharge the mortgage over that property. if the event there is a surplus then the funds are to be invested in joint names.[6] division 7a tax suffice to say there may be a contingent liability but i am unable to commence on the existence or quantum of any liability. in the event the loans are compliant, there is a potential exposure to \u201ctop up tax\u201d in managing the loans. based on the available information, it seems to me that any such liability may not be substantial. advice from the external accountant may be required.[7] as at 30 june 2018, mr j estimated the amount owing by the parties to the company as being $379,552.00. applying an average marginal tax rate of 34.5% across all years, an estimate of the division 7a loan balances and potential tax payable of each balance being assess as a deemed unfranked dividend is: [8] [table removed] the issues & legal priniciples applicable the expression \u2018just and equitable\u2019 is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[10] what emerges from the authorities is that while there might be a \u201crule\u201d the application of which is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, the manner in which a particular liability should be treated is, ultimately, dependent upon the nature of the liability, the circumstances surrounding the liability and the dictates of justice and equity shaped by each. the usual practice or \u201crule\u201d sits comfortably and conformably within that rubric \u2013 in many cases, perhaps almost all, liabilities will be deducted from the \u201cgross\u201d value of the property because it will be clear (and even if not expressly stated, determined) that the justice and equity of the case demands that the liabilities should be met by the parties in the proportions in which the court determines the property is to be divided. while some liabilities are charges upon the property which can be accurately assessed at a certain date, others are at large, or have not been precisely determined, e.g. tax liabilities. in some cases the amount of the liability can only be estimated generally. the court can make an allowance for a particular liability if appropriate to do so. in some cases there are sufficient uncertainties as to the alleged liability to lead the court to disregard it entirely or partly. in other cases, the court may take the view that because of the circumstances surrounding the incurring of the liability it ought in justice and equity to be wholly or partly disregarded in determining the appropriate order to make under sec. 79 as between the parties to the marriage. such a result could be reached where a spouse had incurred a liability in deliberate or reckless disregard of the other party\u2019s potential entitlement under sec. 79 once a court proceeds to exercise the power in s 79 of the act, being in the substantive phase, a court is required to undertake consideration of the matters in section 79(4) including by reference to s 79(4)(e) the matters in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant. however consideration of such matters may be brief and if it is established that \u2018it seems likely to the court that...the applicant...will be likely to receive by way of property settlement a sum sufficient to cover the advance, that would seem to be sufficient to enable the order sought to be made\u2019.[22] associate: dated: 28 april 2023 dated: 28 april 2023 [1] see annexure -1 to affidavit of dr n filed on 18 april 2023.

[13] the court does not consider that the offer makes any difference to the outcome of the husband\u2019s application to re-open the evidence. particular characteristics of the town b property in summary, the property can only be assessed in its current state as a large rural-zoned reserve lot with future potential for rezoning subject to extensive studies and council approval. [mr k]\u2019s report being the only admissible valuation evidence at trial, the wife, for reasons that are not entirely clear to me (although hindsight is always 20/20) decided to file an affidavit by [mr m]. [mr m] is a solicitor with a masters degree in environmental law, a graduate diploma in legal practice, a bachelor of legal studies, a bachelor of science and who also holds an electrical engineering certificate. he is an expert in planning, administration and environmental law advice and litigation, property law, environmental and planning law, compliance, compulsory acquisition and due diligence and planning agreements. [mr m] had been commissioned by the wife to provide her with written report on 16 february 2022, long before this matter was to proceed to trial, and a copy of that report is annexed to his affidavit. he was specifically asked to advise as to the prospects of a change in zoning for the property in the near to medium term future. his report very thoroughly canvasses all of the relevant regulatory requirements, including consultation requirements in respect of environmental issues and the like. he makes the observation that it will take quite some time for the local environmental plan to come to fruition and for any potential rezoning to occur. he said that this involves pre-lodgement of the plan, which is stage 1, a planning proposal, which is stage 2, a gateway determination, which is stage 3, a post-gateway determination, which is stage 4, and a public exhibition and assessment at stage 5 before a finalisation at stage 6. he says that the realistic timeframe for this process would likely exceed fourteen (14) months. he observes that the \u201crural strategy\u201d had just come off public exhibition as at the time of that report but that various other reports still needed to be undertaken as well, including environmental reports. [mr m] concluded that the [region o] housing strategy did foreshadow that the zoning of [j street, town b] would change from primary production to part \u201cenvironmental protection\u201d and part \u201cmedium density residential\u201d. he says that about 54 % of the total land could benefit from the medium density residential zoning but that about 46 % would be likely to be included within the environmental protection zone as abutting sand dunes and the like, such that it couldn\u2019t be developed as medium density residential. [mr m] also said that until the new local environmental plan was exhibited and finalised, the actual zoning outcome remained tentative. [mr m]\u2019s report was updated and, in particular, he prepared a report of 1 november 2022 addressed to the wife which is also annexed to his affidavit. this report was a specific response to the report of the husband obtained from [planning report] ([mr n]) of 14 april 2021 \u2013 being the report mentioned in the husband\u2019s case outline as referred to earlier. in his updated report, [mr m] effectively agreed with many of the things that [mr n] had said, while at the same time putting in issue various other aspects of what [mr n] said. that is to say, he endorses some but not all of [mr n]\u2019s observations in the report. 32 i will turn briefly then to the [planning] report prepared by [mr n]. [mr n]\u2019s report had been commissioned by the husband on 14 april 2021. self-evidently, the husband had been in possession of this report for 19 months or thereabouts before the final hearing. [mr n] was never put on affidavit. [mr n] was not available for cross-examination at the trial. it appears to me that [mr n] is an expert town planner, rather than an expert valuer. [mr n]\u2019s report speaks glowingly about the rezoning potential of the [town b] property, referring to the potential for the existing tourist facility to increase in size and that if it was redeveloped as medium density residential then the value of the property might increase significantly. he referred to the three local council environmental plans that existed across the [region g] region. he referred to their impending consolidation into a single local environmental plan. he referred to the draft housing strategy adopted by the [region g] council in december 2020 to which i have referred. he estimated that the new lep would come into effect some time in 2023. his opinion was that upon it coming into force, the proprietor of the [town b] property would be able to build residential accommodation up to a height of 12 metres provided it was medium density housing only. he said: the site has been identified and accepted by council as a future medium density zone. this new zoning will come into effect in the new lep which at this stage may occur in 2023. the new zoning provides significant development opportunity for the provision of medium density housing in a unique location. such medium density development could occur by conversion of the existing tourist units to a residential use, or complete redevelopment of the site to provide a new medium density development. such locations available for development of the [sic] nature are becoming very rare in location [sic] in new south wales. in our opinion the future development potential significantly increases the value of the land. given the current zoning of the land is rural, it would not be unexpected that the site could realise a land value increase of between 250 - 400 % when the new medium density zoning comes into effect. annexed to the planning report is an analysis of zoning issues and relevant responses in support of a rezoning of the [town b] property to medium property residential. again, i reiterate, [mr n] was never put on affidavit. no expert evidence was called from him in admissible form by the husband at trial. an important point to note here is that the only reason the planning report is even before me is because the wife chose to file an affidavit by [mr m] which specifically responded to it. in that sense, she put that report before me. in his report of 1 november 2022 responding to the planning report, [mr m] agreed with the current zoning of the property, as set out by [mr n]. he agreed that there was a single consolidated local environmental plan being progressed and he agreed that the draft housing strategy adopted by [region g] council in december 2020 identified the [town b] property as medium density residential. [mr m]\u2019s report stated that he is far from convinced that a rezoning to medium residential would permit a maximum height of 12 metres in respect of any dwellings built on the property. he observed that this was speculative. he also observed that the timing of the lep was speculative, particularly, that there were other constraints not referred to by [mr n] in his report. this included that the change of zoning was not a certainty, that even if the change of zoning occurred there would be constraints, such as wetland/vegetation, coastal erosion issues and no certainty about permitted height controls. he also questioned the [mr n]\u2019s expertise to value the property. i agree. there is no way, in my view, that the evidence of [mr n] as to a 250-400 % increase would be admissible evidence of that fact because he is clearly not a valuer. i do not say that disrespectfully. it is a simple matter of law that he does not, on the face of that report, have the requisite expertise for that evidence to be admissible expert evidence. returning then to [mr m]\u2019s response to the planning report, [mr m] observes that there are many steps that are involved before council could finalise the local environmental plan. he refers to the various layers of mapping which take quite a significant amount of time to complete. they include land application, land zoning, consideration of lot sizes, building heights, heritage issues, land reservation acquisitions, acid sulphate soils, flood planning, wetlands, urban release area, drinking water catchment, etcetera. he reiterates the various stages that have to be followed before the council can adopt a consolidated local environmental plan. he observes that any development control plan is not the same pathway as the lep. he observes that until the public exhibition of the draft lep it will remain unknown if the change of zoning tentatively proposed will actually reflect the land use zoning depicted in the housing strategy. his report says that in any event there will be two (2) site constraints - namely a vegetation and hazard zone that would arguably impact on any redevelopment potential. he also observes that there may well be amendments to the coastal hazard zone given the impact of global warming and the fact that climate change seems to be proceeding more quickly than perhaps the science had earlier anticipated. in short, it would be fair to say that [mr m] gives a significantly more subdued outlook for the rezoning potential than does [mr n]. he also observes that there can be no assumption as to increased valuations of the property merely based on the change in the zoning because it is necessary to consider the actual development potential of the land itself. he does not himself suggest that he would be in a position to place a value on the property. he does, however, say that a proper valuation must reference and consider the environmental, economic and broad planning constraints as part of the valuation algorithm and that these would include a consideration of the potential developable area of the property. he says that just because there may be some change to the underlying zoning in the future does not automatically mean that the new zoning becomes the default best value use or highest use of the property. he says the ongoing viability of the [property], whether under a continuing existing use right, must also be considered. in short, [mr m] disagrees with the advice from planning and his report concludes as follows: we disagree with the advice, in our opinion, we are unlikely to see a new lep and dcp coming into effect until at least 2024. there remains a degree of uncertainty as to whether the property will be rezoned medium density. the draft lep when it is finally exhibited can increase that certainty, but even at that point adjustments in zoning can still be made. based on the current site constraints, in our opinion, under a best-case scenario only about 54 % of the property would potential have for any zone permissible development [sic] there is no certainty that a height of building control at 12 metres will be imposed. the increase in value of an ru1 to rezoning, expressed under the advice of \u201c250 \u2013 400%\u201d is entirely speculative. it is not apparent whether the author of the advice has any formal qualifications as a valuation expert. applying that range of an increase to the current market value of the property, without qualifications as to timing and constraints is an exercise fraught with risk and error. a business case would also need to be developed to understand the most economical use of the property post any zoning change. the continued use and expansion of the tourist [property] may make greater commercial sense. ... ...[mr k] was kind enough to make himself available again that afternoon and, in the course of some further cross-examination, it was obvious to me that he was prevaricating somewhat about whether they may or may not be a change in value from what he had estimated in his report. he said that he was \u201cthinking out loud\u201d and obviously he was caught somewhat off-guard by the fact of not having ever seen the report of [mr n] before. he said that that the value of the property may go up or it may go down over time. if he were to undertake a fresh valuation at a future time its value may have changed. he said that it may be necessary to demolish existing structures if the property was revalued so that the ultimate value of the land may not, in fact, increase even if the rezoning took place. he said that the market may possibly be softened by the interest rate rises that have occurred in the meantime. in short, [mr k] clearly seemed to be grappling and, to some extent, prevaricating about what the value of the [town b] land might be but, ultimately, it was apparent that he had based his decision on the most recent information given to him by [mr l] at council as recorded in his report. in the end, [mr k] said that he could not say that there would be an increase in value based on the planning report which had now been brought to his attention and that probably there would not be any increase in value unless there was more certainty about the rezoning of the land. with respect, [mr k]\u2019s oral evidence did not fill me with confidence. he did appear to be struggling somewhat. but fundamentally, and with some reservations, he stood by his original valuation figure of $4.1m which is incorporated in the balance sheet. ... ... i have before me evidence from an expert valuer ([mr k]) which values this property and the structures thereon at $4.1 million. the report contains an acknowledgment that an allowance has been made for future development potential. in that sense, although [mr k] did not have the report of planning, it is clear enough that [mr k] was aware of the possibility, or even probability, of the land being rezoned. indeed, as i have observed earlier, a possible rezoning for this property has been on the cards since at least 2019 although as i observed at trial, it has not happened yet. the matter has taken some two (2) years and nine (9) months to reach a trial. it could well be months or years before the council local environmental plan is finalised. these things are uncertain. ... in my view, the husband and the wife are both well aware of the possibility and, perhaps probability, of the [town b] property being rezoned, it has been on the cards for years. it has not yet happened. there are many uncertainties. there are many planning considerations. even if the rezoning occurs there will be many other considerations relevant to a valuation, such as whether the existing use is not, in fact, a better use for the property. or whether the costs of \u201cimproving\u201d the property to take advantage of that change in zoning will, in fact, outweigh the benefits and, if so, would they outweigh them in such a fashion as to make a significant difference to the value of the land. 79 in short, there are a lot of unknowns in this case. if i adjourn these proceedings over, it seems to me that the court will be waiting, potentially, for an interminably long time, with respect, for the [region g] council to arrive at a decision as to zoning. and, even then, that will not be the end of the matter. i do not know when the zoning change will happen. if it does, then it could be sometime late in 2023, it could be in 2024, it could be later or, perhaps, it will not happen at all. 146 this would, however, usually be relevant only in the following circumstances: to highlight a significant discrepancy between the value of assets to be retained by each of the parties which calls for some further adjustment..., or to show that the extent of assets to be retained by each party following assessment of contributions is such that there is no warrant for further adjustment...or that a further adjustment is required..., or where the nature of the property to be retained by one of the parties has a quality about it which is not accurately reflected in the value ascribed...[14] emphasis) step 5: ensuring a \u201cjust & equitable\u201d outcome conclusion & orders: associate: dated: 28 april 2023 dated: 28 april 2023 [1] on 9/12/22, i delivered

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 31 may 2023 federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2) kadis & elmore [2023] fedcfamc2f 479 orders the court orders that: reasons for judgment judge o\u2019shannessyintroduction background the proceedings ... that a penalty be payable to the commonwealth by the respondent, as this honourable court deems appropriate (as per csrca, ss 67 & 67a). 27 september 2021 hearing ... documents relied upon how the debt occurred exhibit h2 b. that i had no means of paying anything myself, and given that any payment to [the mother] would have to come from a third party then such amount was, in all likelihood, more than she would obtain by pursuing me personally. i otherwise dispute the claim at paragraph 9 of [the mother]'s affidavit of 19/03/2021. at the present time, i am the primary care-giver for my 2 children, ... aged 7 and 5 respectively. my wife ... is the 'bread-winner' in our home. the offer elucidated in the letter from my solicitors was made in a genuine attempt to give [the mother] something and to resolve the matter. ... in relation to paragraph 11 of [the mother]'s affidavit of 19/03/2021, i confirm that the facts set out in the letter from my solicitor were correct then and are correct now. i have no assets and i have no income other than my superannuation. ... ... the issue to be determined is whether [the father]\u2019s estimate of nil income on 22 july 2016 should be accepted. ... pursuant to subsection 60(3) of the [csaa], it is open to [the father] to estimate his adjusted taxable income for the remaining part of a year of income, in this case until 30 june 2017. pursuant to subsection 63aa(2) of the act, that election may not be accepted if it is less than the amount considered likely to be [the father]\u2019s actual income for that period. it was [the father]\u2019s evidence that i could not accept that his income was nil on 22 july 2016. he was, at that time, working and receiving income. on 20 and 21 july 2016, he received income totalling $3,000. he gave evidence that he had lied to the department when he claimed to have nil income at that time. i am satisfied that the amount of [the father]\u2019s estimate of income is less than is likely to be his actual adjusted taxable income for the remainder of the financial year ending 30 june 2017. the direction to refuse to accept his income is enlivened. [the father] sought that i exercise that direction in his favour because he has multiple child support cases with two ex-wives, both of whom he claims to continue to harass him. he gave evidence of not being able to deal with child support issues. he gave evidence of being depressed and behaving erratically, although conceded he was working from july 2015. he gave evidence of gambling which put his third marriage at significant risk. the principle object of the act is to ensure that [the children of these proceedings] receive a proper level of financial support from their parents. to exercise the direction in the favour of [the father] would not promote that object. i refuse to accept [the father]\u2019s estimate of nil income on 22 july 2016. ... exhibit m1 a decision was made by that tribunal on 15 february 2017 based on the above findings, the coa decision was set aside and the following changes were made: - for the period between 1 april 2016 and 30 june 2016 the adjusted taxable income of [the father] was varied to $243,257.00, - for the period between i july 2016 and 30 june 2017 the adjusted taxable income of [the father] was varied to $162,086.00, and - for the period between 1 january 2017 and 31 december 2017 the annual rate of child support was increased by $2,500.00. ... in order to establish reason 8a i must be satisfied that the child support assessment is unfair because of [the father]\u2019s income, property or financial resources. [the father] has not provided a satisfactory response to the application or any evidence as to his finances and the finances of his business. ... ... the evidence in this matter is unsatisfactory but the law is that i must do the best that i can with the evidence that i have. the unsatisfactory nature of the evidence is largely due to the failure by [the father] to provide a response and full disclosure as to his finances. ... the income currently used in the assessment is $15,239.00. based on the evidence set out above and [the father]'s failure to respond to the application or provide evidence as to his income, i find [the father]'s current income is significantly higher than he has been assessed upon. i am satisfied that this makes the child support assessment unfair and so special circumstances exist. reason 8a is established. [the mother] also asked dhs to consider the earning capacity of [the father]. if i am to determine that a parent's earning capacity is greater than is reflected in his or her income used in the child support formula i have to be satisfied on the balance of probability (what is more likely than not to be the case) about all of the following three matters: the parent is: - not working despite ample opportunity to do so, or - has reduced his or her weekly hours of work to below full time work, or - has changed his or her occupation, industry or working pattern. and the parent's decision about his or her work arrangements is not justified by either: - his or her caring responsibilities, or - his or her state of health and the parent has failed to show that the decision about his or her work arrangements was not substantially motivated by the effect this would have on the child support assessment. ... the third test is framed as a 'rebuttable presumption' and this means that the starting point is that affecting the child support assessment is presumed to be a major purpose of the parent's decision about his or her working arrangements. the parent can rebut this presumption by demonstrating, to a decision maker's satisfaction, that affecting the child support assessment was not a major purpose of his or her decision. this is a subjective test and i must consider what the parent's purposes were in making the decision about his or her working arrangements and whether a major purpose was to affect the child support assessment. the uncontested is [the father] was working for [employer b] on a very good level of income but left that position. in the aat it was shown that he has failed to disclose relevant information about his employment and earnings. he has also not provided dhs any evidence in regard to his circumstances or as to why he chose to leave a well-paid job. in the circumstances i am satisfied that [the father]: - has changed his occupation, industry or working pattern. and his decision about his work arrangements is not justified by either: - his caring responsibilities, or - his state of health and that he has failed to show that the decision about his work arrangements was not substantially motivated by the effect this would have on the child support assessment. that being the case i am satisfied that [the father] has a higher earning capacity in line with his previous earnings from [employer b]. special circumstances are therefore established and i find that reason 8b is established. ... [the mother] is employed and only earns a very modest level of income. she resides in a rented home and her main assets consist only of her car, household contents and superannuation. her evidence is, and i accept, that she is struggling financially and had to enter into a debt agreement proposal under the bankruptcy act 1966 on 6 september 2017. [the mother] did not claim that there are currently any necessary costs that can be said to be special or out of the ordinary for her support or the support of the children. i have already discussed [the father]'s income and earning capacity. unfortunately i have no other current financial information in regard to him due to his failure to take part in this process. nevertheless, in the absence of evidence to the contrary i will take it that there is nothing about his commitments necessary for his support that can be said to be special or out of the ordinary. ... having regard to the matters set out above i am satisfied that it would be just and equitable to change the administrative assessment of child support. ... in deciding whether or not to change the assessment i must also consider whether a change to the assessment would be fair to the community (otherwise proper). this means that where the receiving parent receives an income tested pension or benefit, i have to consider the effect a change to the assessment would have on the pension or benefit. ... i note that any increase in the level of child support to be provided by [the father] would be likely to, if anything, decrease the burden on the community through the provision of income tested payments to [the mother] and would ensure that the primary duty to maintain the children is borne by the parents. i am therefore satisfied that it would be otherwise proper to change the administrative assessment of child support. ... having carefully considered the evidence i am satisfied that as from 1 january 2018 the adjusted taxable income of [the father] should be set at $147,500.00 which will give an annual rate of child support around $12,000.00 as requested by [the mother]. i have decided that the change to the annual rate of child support should commence on 1 january 2018 as that is the date from which the changes made by the aat ended. this will create a substantial level of arrears of child support and i am satisfied that this is fair in the circumstances. the change that i am making will last until a terminating event occurs with regard to the child support liability for the younger child. this would normally occur when the child attains the age of 18 years. however, if he is still at school at that time [the mother] can apply to this department for the child support liability to be extended until the child's last day of school. this will require a letter being obtained from the school specifying that date and an application being made to this department prior to the child's 18th birthday. it is open to either parent to make a further application in the future if he or she believes it is warranted due to circumstances that have arisen. (emphasis added) father\u2019s case 3. the respondent's costs in connection with this application be reserved. mother\u2019s case 16. ... [the father] has failed to provide evidence of financial hardship. ... application for leave to apply for a departure application a liable parent, or a carer entitled to child support, (the applicant) may apply to a court having jurisdiction under this act for leave for: ...

(emphasis added) section 111 & 112(1)(b) matters to be considered: section 112(4) ... ... i had been attempting to communicate with [the mother] in an attempt to resolve the question of the outstanding child support arrears. this was another reason i had not filed a departure application though primarily, i simply did not have the financial resources to do so ... ... i had never thought i would need to bring a departure application as i hoped that [the mother] would realise that as i did not have capacity to pay, there was very little point in pursuing me and i had offered to settle with her on the basis that my current wife would help me pay the modest settlement sum primarily so as to avoid incurring legal costs to protect her property. however, since [the mother] instigated this litigation i have been forced into reconsidering my position and given that the child support liability is being pursued, i believe i have little alternative other than to seek to correct the amount that is being pursued. i first raised my intention to seek leave to issue a child support departure in my response ... i did so as i genuinely believe the amounts i have been assessed to pay were incorrect and unfair as i had been assessed on income i did not earn. whilst i had always believed these amounts were incorrect, it was not until it was clear to me that [the mother] sought to enforce the debt against me that i realised i needed to have the arrears re-assessed. ... ] in respect of the respondent, the primary judge found she had received \u201clittle or no child support\u201d and so, although she had been primarily responsible for the financial support of the children, her obligation to also supervise and care for them confined her employment opportunities to only part-time work and thereby limited her earning capacity, causing her hardship. but that was hardship she endured because of the paucity of child support she received from the appellant over numerous preceding years. it was not hardship she would suffer if the appellant was granted leave to pursue his review application which, if granted, might either succeed or fail. section 112(4)(c) of the assessment act required the primary judge to consider the hardship she would suffer if the appellant was granted leave to pursue his application, not the hardship she had already endured due to impecuniosity. while s 112(5) of the assessment act might well have permitted the latter consideration to be taken into account, the exercise of discretion miscarried because the primary judge failed to correctly take into account the material factor prescribed by s 112(4)(c) of the assessment act. as it was not even taken into account, it could not be balanced against the countervailing consideration of the hardship the appellant would suffer if leave was denied (s 112(4)(b)). phasis added) conclusion associate: dated: 28 april 2023 dated: 28 april 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "913.txt", "size": 22508, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 22617, "document_id": "913"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "913_chunk_0"}}

[x] started to cry so i quickly grabbed clothes to wear but had trouble putting them on quickly so just went [x] instead who went back to sleep immediately when i comforted her. when i returned to the bedroom, all the lights were off again so i walked in the dark back to the bedroom. i turned the light on and he got up and said to me using words to the following effect: \"can't you turn the other light on?\" i responded using words to the following effect: \"well you knew i was coming back why did you turn all the lights off why didn't you leave that light on?\" he then threw a pillow at me aggressively and it whipped my legs. i moved some of the pillows in his direction. he then sat up and pulled a fist at me and moved it in a motion toward my head. i said to him using words to the following effect: ''you were going to hit me\". he denied it but i said to him using words to the following effect: \"you put your hand into a fist position\". he then grabbed me by the wrists and squeezed tightly. i grabbed his forearms in an attempt to get him to let go as he was hurting me. i scratched him in the process. he continued squeezing my wrist really hard at this point. he then pushed me back. i moved forward when he grabbed my face and then pushed me onto the bed. he then walked into the hallway and i was hysterically screaming at his point because he was acting like he wanted to kill me. he came back into the room, and i was up off the bed. he came closer to me and i thought he was going to hit me. i grabbed the hair straightener on the dresser in front of me and put my hand up in front of my head in a blocking motion. the edge of the straighter nicked the father's chin he then grabbed me again and threw me to the floor. he left to console [x] as she was awake and crying. when he returned, he said to me using words to the following effect: \"look what you did to my chin\". i responded using words to the following effect: \"what about you? you started this all with your games with the lights and the pillows\". he approached my face and mocked me and said using words to the following effect: \"go on what are you going to do?\" he spat in my face and walked out to [x]. i decided to get dressed and left the house to go for a drive in the car. i received a text message from him saying using the following words \"don't come back or i'll call the police\". i ended up parking at a park around the comer from our home. i decided to go back home as i wanted to be home with my daughter.[30] i recall an incident in 2020, however, i cannot recall the exact month where the father had attacked me in front of [x] while i was holding [y] on the sofa. he had [hit] me multiple times in the abdomen and leg [...] after having thrown multiple household items at me [...]. he then proceeded to throw me around on the sofa while i held [y] and did not stop when i screamed at him \"look at the baby! i'm holding the baby\". during my attempt to call the police, the father had grabbed the phone off me and smashed it onto floor, stepped on and picked the same up and attempted to bend the phone. i was crying over the counter and the father approached me and pushed me against the fridge. he said to me using word to the following effect: \"what do you think you were going to fi1cking do with that? he then proceeds to put me face down onto the floor and put all his weight on me. i did not let go of the [weapon] as i now believed that he would hit me with the [weapon] if l gave it up. he then said using words to the following effect: \"if you don\u2019t let go i am going to break your shoulder\". he had his knee into my arm and was twisting my elbow. i let go and he grabbed the [weapon] as my am1 felt like it was going to break. while still on me he said using words to the following effect: \"you are a fucking idiot, did you really think you could do something like that to me?\" he then proceeded [to hurt] my leg with the [weapon] and then let me go. after this happened the father gave me a band aid and said \"i should call the police on you\". the father would always twist his violent assaults on me somehow making out they were my fault, and he was the one that had been harmed. i was in shock and then said to me: ''you were in the wrong and need to apologise to me\". i never lifted the [weapon] towards the father or directed the [weapon] towards him.[39] the father started kicking my legs to get out of the room and i said using words to the following effect \"what's wrong with you? i'm trying to help, look at you how frustrated you are? i'm not leaving this room until you do\". he then got up and said to me using words to the following effect: \"you are an ugly bitch and annoying cunt. you make everything worse\". i said using words to the following effect: \"why are you fighting me? i'm trying to defuse the situation\". the father then mocked me and said: \"ugly faced cunt\" whilst walking out the door. i threw my phone in his direction which hit the hallway wall. i was upset by the father's continual denigration of me. the father then turned around staunched over me and i said: \"what are you going to do, hit me?\". the father pushed me against the dresser then dragged me to the other side of the room. he then grabbed me again and threw me on the armchair, then jumped on top of me, put both hands around my throat [...]. whilst [hurting] me he said using words to the following effect: \"i'm going to fucking kill you bitch\". [x] started screaming and crying which led to the father letting go\". i was in pain and fell from the chair to the floor as my neck had wrapped around the arm rest. i sustained [injuries] as well as markings from the applicant's hands and fingernails during his attempt at [hurting] me. i had scratched the applicant's arm in my attempts at struggling to breath and trying to fight him off me. i was screaming and crying from the pain and the father responded using words to the following effect: \"stop faking it and acting like a victim\" he then pulled me up like a rag doll causing more pain to my neck. i eventually managed to get up and went to get [x]. i told him to leave the house.[40] 2. until further order and substitute of any time order benefitting the father, the father will spend the following time with the children, namely [x] born [...] 2019 and [y] born [...] 2020 as follows: a. each alternate sunday from 9am until 2pm, b. each alternate saturday from 2pm until 4pm. 3.that the fathers time with the children be supervised by either of the paternal grandparents namely, [mr c] and [ms b]. current circumstances documents to be relied upon and evidence the applicant did not leave and was pacing back and forth on the front lawn, whilst having a cigarette against his car. my partner at the time arrived at the premises and as he got out of his vehicle the applicant approached him and took a swing at his head. he continued to attack him, and i ran out to try and stop it as my partner had an apparent head scan at the doctors just before. my eldest son them followed me as he was worried and by then, the applicant focused on me and trying to hurt me. my eldest son stood in front of me and then was being pushed and thrown around on the front lawn by the applicant. the applicant stopped suddenly as he saw my mother's vehicle pulling into the driveway. he continued to say 'fuck you [...], you're a coward\" and got into his vehicle. shortly after the police arrived and took a video statement from my sister and was told not to contact the other party.[58] these are very young children who are entirely dependent on their adult carer\u2019s to protect them from harm and provide for their needs. what was reported about the children having a strong startle reflex, needing soothing to sleep, not talking and being sensitive to raised voices, indicates that these children have likely been traumatised by witnessing family violence. it is a matter of dispute as to whether one or both parents instigated this, but in either event, the family violence appears to have caused harm to the children and effected their development. when provided feedback on the children\u2019s reported hypervigilance around noises being associated with their experiences of family violence, the parents both acknowledged this. the parents also acknowledged that, at the children\u2019s very young ages, any increasing time they spend with [mr bannister] would need to be incremental.[59] just based on the children\u2019s current ages and developmental stages, the current spends time arrangements would be appropriate. however, if [mr bannister] is found to have perpetrated family violence as alleged, if that is the case, then it may not be in the children\u2019s best interests to spend time with him at all (including supervised time).[60] matters agreed issues for determination issue 1: should the father be consulted in relation to major long term decisions impacting the children, although, giving the mother the final say as to any decision made? issue 2: should there be a move for the father from supervised time to unsupervised time (including overnight time) with children? parenting orders: the law unacceptable risk the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children\u2019s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[70] standard of proof the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. the child/children\u2019s best interests the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of the children\u2019s parents (s 60cc(2)(a)) what these definitions convey is that \"meaningful\", when used in the context of \"meaningful relationship\", is synonymous with \"significant\" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for \"important\" or \"of consequence\". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[74] a \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 does not, however, have to be an \u2018optimal relationship\u2019. kay j\u2019s remarks in godfrey & sanders more fully state this position: it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[75] the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence (s 60cc(2)(b)) bannister] confirmed that there is a current advo protecting [ms kroll] from him and there are associated charges [...]. he said that these matters are currently before the criminal courts and he is pleading not guilty. [mr bannister] also confirmed that he plead guilty to assaulting [ms kroll] in 2018 and received a good behaviour bond. he advised that he remains on waiting lists for a men\u2019s behaviour change program. [mr bannister] said that he has not instigated physical violence, but has retaliated physically to [ms kroll\u2019s] violence towards him, and there have been injuries to both of them. he said that they were both verbally abusive, and arguments escalated to threats. [mr bannister] reported that the children witnessed verbal abuse and physical violence. he denied being controlling towards [ms kroll] and said that she was controlling of him, and would say that she would not feed the children until he got home, meaning that they would be \u201cstarving\u201d.[79] before turning to the wife\u2019s evidence in this respect, it is desirable to say something about the corroboration of family violence. it is well settled that a party does not require their evidence of family violence to be corroborated before such evidence can be accepted. given the tendency of domestic violence to occur in circumstances where there are no witnesses other than the parties to the marriage and perhaps their children, this must necessarily be so: see keating & keating [2019] famcafc 46, (2019) flc 93-894 at [42] (ainslie-wallace and ryan jj) (\u201ckeating\u201d), hendy & penningh [2018] famcafc 257, (2018) flc 93-879 at [72] (ainslie-wallace, ryan & austin jj), amador & amador [2009] famcafc 196, (2009) 43 fam lr 268 at [79] (may, coleman & le poer trench jj) (\u201camador\u201d). whilst as a general principle it is important to identify a core consistency in the evidence of an alleged victim of family violence rather than concentrating on supposed inconsistencies in the evidence, this does not permit a court to ignore or otherwise dismiss inconsistencies in that evidence: keating at [62] (austin j), zuen & lhao [2020] famcafc 84 at [22]- [24] (ryan, aldridge and stevenson jj) (\u201czuen & lhao\u201d). however the reference to the importance of identifying a core consistency, while important in cases involving family violence, must not obscure the reality that there cannot be a finding of family violence otherwise than in accordance with s 140 of the evidence act and having regard to all relevant matters: see amador at [86]-[93]. where allegations of family violence are made it is necessary for the court to make findings where the evidence enables that to be done: see zuen & lhao at [24].[82] currently he lives with his mother having moved back about four months ago. it seems that his irritability made for a lot of tension with his partner. h would \u201cgo into rages \u2014 get physically violent \u2014 smoke a lot \u2014 drink a lot.\u201d[88] oss of libido coupled with majiuanna and [medication] use. his current presentation seems broadly consistent with a major depressive disorder and prominent anxiety and a combined substance use disorder (marijuana and [medication])[89] \u201call evidence is to be weighed according to the poof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other side to have contradicted.\u201d[94] \u201ccan be confident about drawing inferences against a party who has chosen not to give evidence [if] it was within the power of the party to produce evidence on that matter.\u201d[95] the \u201crule in jones v dunkel\u201d relates to the potential for an adverse inference to be drawn in circumstances where evidence presented in a case raises an inference against a party and that party is in a position to give or call evidence to refute it and does not do so. but, the \u201crule in jones v dunkel\u201d can be seen as \u201ca particular application\u201d of \u201cthe rule in blatch v archer\u201d. (see ho v powell [2001] nswca 168 per hodgson ja at [15], beazley ja agreeing). the latter \u201c... applies where a person bearing the onus of proof does not give or call evidence which that person is plainly in a position to give or call, and unless some explanation is given of that failure, the tribunal of fact is entitled to infer that this evidence would not have assisted that person\u2019s case ...\u201d (ho v powell). the principle in blatch v archer can be seen as wider than the \u201crule in jones v dunkel\u201d \u201cbecause it is also available against the person bearing the onus of proof where that person does not adduce evidence that he or she was plainly in a position to adduce\u201d. (australian securities and investments commission v rich [2009] nswsc 1229 per austin j at [439].\u201d[96] he failure of a party who bears an onus of proof to call an available witness who could cast light on some matter in dispute can be taken into account in deciding whether that onus is discharged, in circumstances where such evidence as has been called does not itself clearly discharge the onus.\u201d [97] but the future likelihood of that event occurring needs to be evaluated not only in terms of the cogency of the evidence that it has occurred in the past, but also in the context of the father\u2019s denials and the vigilance of the parties, given the events that have led them to litigate over these issues so early in the child\u2019s life. what potential there was for these events to continue to occur if they had previously occurred in the past, might well be diminished by the bright lights that have been shone upon the parties and their conduct, in the course of these proceedings.[99] (emphasis added) the father has finished the men\u2019s behaviour change course, (b) he maintains ongoing therapy with his psychologist, (c) his psychologist has all of the

weight to be afforded to those views given their age and level of maturity (s 60cc(3)(a)) the terms of s 60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child\u2019s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child\u2019s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child\u2019s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court

(3) the order is taken to require each of those persons: to consult the other person in relation to the decision to be made about that issue, and (b) to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about that issue. to avoid doubt, this section does not require any other person to establish, before acting on a decision about the child communicated by one of those persons that the decision has been made jointly. ... issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long-term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about: the child's education (both current and future), and (b) the child's religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child's health, and (d) the child's name, and (e) changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent. ...

(2) the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent of the child (or a person who lives with a parent of the child) has engaged in: abuse of the child or another child who, at the time, was a member of the parent\u2019s family (or that other person\u2019s family), or (b) family violence. ... (4) the presumption may be rebutted by evidence that satisfies the court that it would not be in the best interests of the child for the child\u2019s parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for the child. applicability of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility in this case 61da(2)] does not say that, if there are reasonable grounds to believe one of the nominated circumstances exists, equal shared parental responsibility, qualified or unqualified, shall not be ordered, but merely that the presumption does not apply (at all).[112] equal time or substantial and significant time? conclusion the central task of determining parenting orders in a child\u2019s best interests is not an exercise in searching for disqualifying factors in either parent. recognising that each person is unique, inevitably with strengths and weaknesses, both as a person and as a parent, the inquiry is essentially to determine parenting orders that will positively promote the child\u2019s best interests in the context of that child\u2019s actual circumstances, including any perceived parenting weakness of either or both of the child\u2019s parents. parental conduct is relevant only to the extent that it informs the assessment of parenting capacity or otherwise has weight in the determination of the parenting orders in the child\u2019s best interests, having regard to the considerations expressed in s 60cc of the act, which the court must consider in determining parenting orders in the best interests of the child. in this context, it is worth noting that in jurss & jurss [1976] famca 20, (1976) flc 90-041, a case decided not long after the act, in its original form, came into effect, demack j noted in respect of a then \u201ccustody\u201d dispute that the court\u2019s inquiry is essentially a positive one designed to promote the interests of the child, not to demote the claims of either parent. given that the overriding consideration for this court is best interests, the court must consider the conduct of parents not with a view to punishing such conduct or to reward one parent and punish the other, but to ascertain from such conduct, to the extent to which it is relevant, where the best interests of the subject child or children will be served from now or into the future. the icl\u2019s costs the law as to costs is well settled. section 117 of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d) provides that, subject to certain qualifications, each party to proceedings shall bear his or her own costs. section 117(2) provides that if the court is of the opinion that there are circumstances justifying it in doing so, the court may make such order as to costs as the court considers just. the relevant considerations in relation to an order for costs are set out in s 117(2a). the matters relevant to determining what order, if any, should be made for costs are set out in subsection (2a) of that section. they are the following: the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings, (b) whether any party has legal aid and the terms of any grant of aid, (c) the conduct of the parties to the proceedings in relation to the proceedings including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the conduct of the parties in relation to pleadings, particulars, discovery, inspection, directions to answers, questions, admissions of facts, production of documents and similar matters, (d) whether the proceedings were necessitated by the failure of a party to the proceedings to comply with previous orders of the court, (e) whether any party to the proceedings has been wholly unsuccessful in the proceedings, (f) whether either party to the proceedings has made an offer in writing to the other party to the proceedings to settle the proceedings and the terms of any such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant. section 117(3) provides: to avoid doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children\u2019s lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children\u2019s lawyer in respect of the proceedings. section 117(4) provides: however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if: a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer, the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children's lawyer. section 117(5) provides: in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2) in proceedings in which an independent children\u2019s lawyer has been appointed, the court must disregard the fact that the independent children\u2019s lawyer is funded under a legal aid scheme or service established under a commonwealth, state or territory law or approved by the attorney-general. a question arises as to the actual meaning of the legislative intent for the court to \u201cdisregard the legal aid funding\u201d of the independent children\u2019s lawyer, because that terminology is susceptible to ambiguity. as opined by austin j in gahen & gahen (no 2) [2013] famca 936, it could conceivably mean either: the independent children's lawyer should be presumed to be unfunded, so as to generally incline the court to order the parties\u2019 contribution to the independent children's lawyer\u2019s costs, or (b) the court should not be swayed by either the presumed ampleness or scarcity of the independent children's lawyer\u2019s legal aid funding when determining whether to order the parties\u2019 contribution to the independent children\u2019s lawyer\u2019s costs. in de roma & de roma [2013] famca 566 watts j explained why the former is the preferred connotation, since the purposes of the legislative provision was to protect the public purse. the threshold presumption as to each party bearing their own costs has no application to the independent children\u2019s lawyer, who is not a party. the law is well settled, however, that there is power under the section, subject to other statutory provisions referred to below, to make orders for or against the independent children\u2019s lawyer and the court may make such order as to costs of the independent children\u2019s lawyer and in such proportions in relation to each of the parties as the court considers just: (de roma & de roma (supra)).[113] associate: dated: 31 may 2023 dated: 31 may 2023 [1]

(\u2018the wife\u2019) and opposed by mr yancey (\u2018the husband\u2019). 2 the wife filed an application for final orders on 23 april 2020 seeking a just and equitable division of the parties\u2019 property. 3 the wife also applied for interim spousal maintenance, disclosure and costs. on 15 july 2020 judge mcguire (as he then was) ordered that the husband pay the wife spousal maintenance in the amount of $250.00 per week from 17 july 2020 onwards. the wife later agreed that she would no longer receive the spousal maintenance so ordered. this was because the husband, at that time, met all outgoings (including rates, mortgages and taxes) in relation to several properties subject to these proceedings. 4 the proceedings for final property orders came before me for trial on 3 august 2021. the wife appeared with the assistance of a language 1 interpreter through microsoft teams. 5 before the hearing, counsel informed me that the parties had reached agreement regarding the husband\u2019s superannuation interest. the parties agreed that the wife would receive a sum of $30,415.50, to be split from the husband\u2019s b superannuation interest. this sum represents 50% of the agreed value of the husband\u2019s superannuation interest. overview the parties 6 the wife, currently 58 years of age, originally hails from city e in country f. prior to the relationship subject to these proceedings, she was married to mr g between 1988 and 2002. upon separation, the then-mr and mrs r finalised a financial settlement. the wife continued to raise their child, mr x (\u2018x\u2019) born in 1990, and received child support from mr yancey to do so. she was employed between 2008 and 2011 in casual sales work by her sister, ms h ngueng, and used her savings and settlement funds to visit australia in 2012. 7 the husband, currently 52 years of age, was born in town j and has been employed by company k as a factory worker since 1989. prior to his relationship with the wife he had bought and in some cases sold a number of local properties as set out at paragraphs 25 \u2013 27. 8 also prior to the relationship, the husband was affected by a number of workplace and non-workplace injuries. his most recent ailment, being a knee injury, led him to meet the wife in suburb n following a medical appointment. timeline of the parties\u2019 relationship 9 the parties met in city l in early 2012. the wife was visiting and staying with a friend. 10 the parties became friends and communicated throughout their relationship by using translation applications. 11 the wife contends that the relationship commenced in june 2012, shortly after the husband invited her to move to tasmania. the husband, on the other hand, contends that the relationship began when the wife moved into his home at c road in suburb d in 2013. 12 the parties married in 2013. 13 throughout the course of the marriage the parties predominantly conducted their relationship between tasmania and country f. 14 a few months after the parties married, the wife travelled to country f and remained there, returning in 2014. this was the first time that the wife travelled to country f during the marriage. the husband spent approximately one month of that period with the wife in country f. 15 in 2014 the husband drew $80,000.00 from his superannuation fund to meet debts and living expenses. 16 the husband claims that in 2015 the wife again travelled to country f for a few months. 17 in mid-2016 the parties travelled to country f and country m. the wife left in 2016, followed later by the husband, from which time the parties travelled together. they returned to australia in or about 2016. 18 in 2018 the parties travelled to country n for a holiday. this was, on the husband\u2019s account, an attempt by him to repair their relationship.[1] 19 the husband asserts that separation occurred in 2018 after this holiday. 20 the wife asserts that separation occurred in 2019. the wife claims that, in 2019, she experienced family violence perpetrated by the husband.[2] her allegations include that the husband was verbally abusive, attempted to kick her out and lock her out of the property at c road, suburb d, damaged parts of that property by removing fixtures and attempted to cancel her car registration by returning her number plates to service tasmania. 21 regardless of the date of separation, the parties agree that they lived separated but under the same roof until approximately 2019. 22 the wife again travelled to country f in 2019. her stay in country f was extended after she was diagnosed with a medical condition. the wife was required to, and did, undertake treatment for her medical condition. she received this treatment while she was in country f. 23 the wife returned to australia in 2019 and took up residence in town j. 24 i note that determinations with respect to the commencement and end dates of the parties\u2019 relationship are located at paragraphs 118 \u2013 131 of these reasons. property acquired before and during the relationship 25 prior to the relationship with the wife, the husband owned five properties, including:[3] (1) c road, suburb d, purchased in 1991, (2) d road, town j, purchased in 1992 and sold in 2001, (3) e street, region k, purchased in 1993 and sold in 2001, (4) f street, town l, purchased in 1995 and used from time to time for agriculture, and (5) g street, suburb m, purchased in 2005 and retained as a rental property ever since. c road, suburb d, purchased in 1991, (2) d road, town j, purchased in 1992 and sold in 2001, (3) e street, region k, purchased in 1993 and sold in 2001, (4) f street, town l, purchased in 1995 and used from time to time for agriculture, and (5) g street, suburb m, purchased in 2005 and retained as a rental property ever since. 26 i note that the property c road, suburb d remains the husband\u2019s primary residence. this property was also the parties\u2019 home during their relationship. 27 during the relationship, the husband acquired four more properties with the intention of keeping them as investment properties:[4] (1) h street, suburb n, (2) j street, suburb m, (3) k street suburb n, and (4) l street, suburb n(1). h street, suburb n, (2) j street, suburb m, (3) k street suburb n, and (4) l street, suburb n(1). documents relied upon 28 the wife relies upon the following documents: application for final orders, filed 23 april 2020, affidavit of ms ngueng, filed 19 may 2021, financial statement of ms ngueng, filed 19 may 2021, affidavit of mr o, filed 13 may 2021, and exhibit \u2018a\u2019, being the asset pool at pages 4-5 of the wife\u2019s case outline. 29 the husband relies on the following documents: response to application for final orders, filed 13 august 2020, affidavit of mr yancey, filed 3 may 2021, financial statement of mr yancey, filed 3 may 2021, affidavit of p, filed 3 may 2021, affidavit of mr o, filed 13 may 2021, and exhibit \u2018a\u2019, being the asset pool at pages 4-5 of the wife\u2019s case outline. 30 the parties agreed at trial that exhibit \u2018a\u2019 should be relied upon as a representation of their assets, liabilities and superannuation. in its original form as tendered, this document was in some respects inconsistent with the evidence provided by the parties. as such, exhibit \u2018a\u2019 has been amended to reflect the evidence. the final corrected form of exhibit \u2018a\u2019 is extracted at paragraph 35 of these reasons. orders sought 31 the wife seeks orders in her case outline in the following terms: 1. that within sixty (60) days the respondent husband will pay to the applicant wife the sum equal to twenty-five percent (25%) of the nett property pool (including superannuation) plus $2,640.00 (being the respondent husband\u2019s share of the property valuations) and $10,000.00 (being the amount outstanding from the loan the respondent husband obtained from the applicant wife\u2019s family), 2. that the applicant wife will do act [sic] such acts and sign all such documents to withdraw the caveats lodged over the respondent husband\u2019s properties, will [sic] all associated fees to be at the applicant wife\u2019s expense, 3. that the applicant wife retains motor vehicle 1 that is currently in her possession, 4. that the respondent husband retains the motor vehicle 2 that is currently in his possession, 5. that within twenty-eight (28) days of the date of the orders the applicant wife will attend c road, suburb d to collect the remainder of her belongings stored at the property, namely personal possessions in the garage, 6. that each party will be otherwise solely entitled to the exclusion of the other to all property and chattels of whatsoever nature and kind in the possession of such party as at the date of the orders and for the purpose bank accounts are deemed to be in the possession of the party whose name appears on the banks [sic] record thereof, insurance policies are deemed to be in the possession of the beneficiary thereof, and superannuation entitlements are deemed to be in the possession of the person who is named as the worker therein and service pensions are deemed to be the property of the person in receipt of the same, 7. that each party is solely liable for and indemnify the other against any liability encumbering any item of property to which that party is entitled pursuant to the orders, 8. the husband pay the costs of and incidental to this application, 9. such other order as the court deems meet. 32 during final submissions, the wife\u2019s position changed with respect to percentages claimed against superannuation and non-superannuation assets. paragraph 1 above seeks \u2018twenty-five percent (25%) of the nett property pool (including superannuation)\u2019 plus other non-superannuation amounts claimed for the property valuations and the purported loan of $10,000.00. the wife\u2019s final submissions, however, specified that she seeks 25% of the non-superannuation pool in addition to the agreed sum of $30,415.50 to be split from the husband\u2019s superannuation fund to her chosen fund. 33 the husband seeks orders in his case outline in the following terms: 1 . no alteration to existing interests of the parties in matrimonial property of the parties and in particular to the following real properties be made: a. c road, suburb d in tasmania volume xxxx folio x, b. m street, suburb m in tasmania volume xxxx folio xx c. g street, suburb m in

expenses, costs and fees relating to said removal. 3 within 7 days of the date of this order the wife shall provide to the husband\u2019s solicitors all documentation and remuneration necessary to effect the removal of caveats referred to in clause 2 herein. 4 the parties otherwise retain all property, liability and financial resources in their names and or possession, including but not limited to motor vehicle 2 in the name and possession of the husband and motor vehicle 1 in the name and possession of the wife. 5 the parties shall each indemnify each other in relation to any outstanding debts owed by them as at the date of this order. in the alternative 6 that the husband retain all his right title and interest in the following real properties, a. k street, suburb n in tasmania volume xxxx folio x, b. h street, suburb n in tasmania volume xxxx folio xx c. g street, suburb m in tasmania volume xxxx folio x, d. j street, suburb m in tasmania volume xxxx folio xxx, e. k street, suburb n in tasmania volume xxxx folio xx, f. l street, suburb n(1) in tasmania volume xxxx folio xxx, and g. f street, town l in tasmania volume xxxx folio x (\u201cthe real properties\u201d). 7 that the wife cause the removal of caveats over all of the real properties. the wife will pay all expenses, costs and fees relating to said removal. 8 within 28 days of the date of this order, the wife shall provide to the husband\u2019s solicitors all documentation and remuneration necessary to effect the removal of caveats referred to in clause 7 herein and the husband will pay to the wife an amount equalling 2 per cent of the net amount of the non-superannuation assets of the matrimonial property and or such lesser sum as the court may order, 9 the parties otherwise retain all property, financial resources and liabilities, in their names and or possession, including but not limited to motor vehicle 2 in the name and possession of the husband and motor vehicle 1 in the name and possession of the wife. 10 the parties shall each indemnify each other in relation to any outstanding debts owed by them as at the date of this order. 11 the wife pay the costs of and incidental to this application, 12 such other order as the court deems meet. 34 at the conclusion of the hearing, the husband effectively abandoned paragraphs 1 to 5 above. in pursuing the balance of the orders sought, the husband\u2019s position is that the wife should receive around 10% of the total net property pool, being 5% of the non-superannuation pool and 50% of the superannuation pool. the asset pool 35 the parties agree, for the most part, the makeup of the property pool. they rely on the property pool as set out in the wife\u2019s case outline.[5] the contents of the property pool balance sheet extracted below includes amendments, shown italicised in the extract below, being: addition of value of the husband\u2019s share of f street, town l, as this was omitted from the wife\u2019s

superannuation fund) $60,831.00 total combined pool $683,628.57 36 the wife seeks an additional order for the repayment of an outstanding debt of $10,000.00 purportedly owed to one of her sisters, ms q ngueng (\u2018ms q ngueng\u2019), and asks that it be included in the balance sheet as a joint debt. the husband does not consent to an order that he repay this purported debt, or that it be included as a joint debt in the balance sheet. 37 the wife also seeks from the husband half of the valuation costs paid by her, amounting to $2,640.00. as mentioned above, the husband consents to an order that he repay this amount to the wife. 38 at the commencement of the hearing the husband maintained that the wife had an interest in a property in country f. this issue was not pursued in final submissions.[7] the wife\u2019s evidence 39 the wife adopted the terms of her affidavit and financial statement during examination-in-chief. she was then cross-examined by mr tucker, counsel for the husband. 40 mr tucker put to the wife that separation occurred in 2018, after the holiday to country n, instead of in 2019. the wife stated that this was a \u2018lie\u2019, and that she had photographs to prove the same. these photographs were not produced. 41 the wife was asked about the purported loan of $10,000.00 from ms q ngueng. this gave rise to an evidentiary issue, as the wife produced no affidavit or oral evidence from ms q ngueng as to this loan. paragraphs 103 \u2013 117 set out my reasons and findings as to the $10,000.00 debt. 42 mr tucker then asked the wife a number of questions about her trips to country f during the marriage. mr tucker put to her that the husband paid her $1,000.00 per month during her 9-month trip to country f between 2013 and 2014 and again in 2016. the wife denied that the husband had done so, instead saying that she travelled to country f with money gifted to her by family and a friend when she got married. the wife did not produce evidence to corroborate that she received funds as a gift and devoted them to her travels, or to dispute that the husband paid $1,000.00 per month to her during this period. the husband\u2019s evidence, though it does not corroborate such payments in 2013-2014, supports his position with respect to the 2016 visit to country f.[8] counsel for the wife, mrs mooney sc, did not challenge the contents of the husband\u2019s bank statements, nor did she challenge the husband\u2019s assertion that they evidence payments by him during the wife\u2019s 2013-2014 and 2016 trips to country f. 43 mr tucker further questioned the wife as to who paid for the spousal visa. the wife recalled that she paid the sum of $2,680.00, and confirmed that this was the total amount due. mr tucker then put to her that the husband paid for the visa in the amount of $4,500.00. the wife maintained her position that she paid for the visa, and that immigration authority records would confirm the same. she did not produce any such records. the husband\u2019s westpac bank statement dated 22 may 2013 to 21 june 2013 shows a debit of $3,000.00 on 11 june 2013,[9] which is the amount that the husband recalls he paid to the department of home affairs as the application fee.[10] 44 the wife said that she paid $2,680.00 for a spousal visa, and denied the cost was $4,500.00. no evidence was produced to corroborate her position. again, the bank statements annexed to the husband\u2019s affidavit purportedly corroborate his payment of the same.[11] 45 mr tucker further put to the wife that she did not assist the husband in purchasing any of the real estate that was acquired during their marriage. she said that the husband is \u2018lying\u2019, and that she helped by finding advertisements for available properties and by accompanying the husband to view these properties. mr tucker then asked how the parties communicated with each other during the marriage, and in response the wife referred to \u2018computer translation\u2019. this, mr tucker suggested, means that she could not have dealt directly with real estate agents. the wife maintained that she would find properties online or in the newspaper, tell the husband about them, and then accompany him to inspections. 46 the husband asserts that, with respect to the investment properties and agricultural production, the wife did not contribute in the manner she claims. 47 mr tucker put to the wife that she did not help with painting or renovating the investment properties, to which she unhelpfully answered that he \u2018should ask the neighbours\u2019. the wife did not call any \u2018neighbours\u2019 from h street, j street, k street or l street to corroborate her contributions to those properties. further, the wife said that mr x did a lot of work on the investment properties. again, she did not call mr x to give evidence about the wife\u2019s, or his own, contributions. 48 the wife also disagreed with mr tucker\u2019s suggestion that she did not help with agricultural production at the matrimonial home. 49 mr tucker asked the wife about her paid employment during the marriage. she responded that she worked for one week in agriculture before the husband \u2018stopped [her] going to work\u2019. mr tucker suggested to the wife that she quit her job. she maintained that the husband asked her not to work because she had an injury. further, she said that she gave her lawyer a document confirming a doctor\u2019s diagnosis of the injury. any document confirming or diagnosing an injury was not produced at trial, nor was it annexed to her affidavit. while there is some medical evidence at \u20181\u2019 and \u20187\u2019, these are attributed to other incidents and the wife does not rely upon them to support her injury diagnosis.[12] 50 the wife gave evidence via an interpreter in a manner which was, at times, short and sharp. the interpreter maintained a visual on the wife in the witness box throughout her evidence. 51 it concerns me that, on a number of occasions, the wife referred to corroborative documents not produced by her or relevant witnesses whom she did not call. these omissions detracted from her evidence, particularly with respect to the alleged $10,000.00 debt to ms q ngueng. 52 notwithstanding the abovementioned evidentiary shortcomings, the husband did not challenge the nature of the wife\u2019s homemaking contributions as detailed in her affidavit. [13] in fact, the husband conceded the same in his case outline.[14] this was important evidence and i accept the same. 53 with respect to her involvement in finding and viewing investment properties, the wife clearly perceived and continued to perceive her role as important and supportive of her partner in a joint endeavour. although the husband downplayed her assistance i have no doubt that, in her mind, she was being cooperative and helpful in choosing and purchasing the investment properties. 54 i accept the wife\u2019s evidence in relation to her homemaking contributions. i also accept that she perceived herself as contributing, and in some ways did contribute, to agricultural production at the matrimonial home and the acquisition of investment properties. 55 i am, however, doubtful about aspects of her evidence where she knew issues were disputed and failed to corroborate her position with documents or witnesses. this includes her failure to, in summary: produce photographs to support that separation occurred in 2019, call ms q ngueng, or put ms q ngueng on affidavit, with respect to the purported $10,000.00 loan, produce bank statements, or other evidence, to corroborate that she paid for her own travel from funds gifted to her, produce records of payments purportedly made by her to the immigration authorities for the spousal visa, or material evidencing that the amount owing for that visa was $2,680.00, call any neighbours of the investment properties to corroborate that she had undertaken work on those properties, call her son, mr x to corroborate her, and his own, work purportedly done on the investment properties, and produce diagnostic records about her injury, as purportedly made by a doctor and given by the wife to her lawyer. 56 i specifically address the wife\u2019s failure to adduce evidence about the $10,000.00 loan at paragraphs 103 \u2013 117 of these reasons. 57 it is not necessary that i have before me corroborative evidence to support each piece of evidence.[15] the absence of corroboration where such evidence is seemingly available and easily presentable does, however, raise questions about the reliability and weight to be afforded to such evidence. this, in turn, affects the completeness and rigour of a party\u2019s position on a fact in issue. 58 i accept the wife\u2019s evidence in relation to her homemaking contributions and her perception of the contribution she made to agricultural production at the matrimonial home and the purchase of properties. i have doubts about some aspects of her evidence where she knew issues were in dispute and had the opportunity to corroborate her position, but failed to do so. i address and determine the failure of the wife to call witnesses and adduce evidence that may have assisted her case later in these reasons. the husband\u2019s evidence 59 the husband confirmed the contents of his affidavit and financial statement. 60 he was cross-examined by mrs mooney sc. 61 the husband maintained that the parties separated in 2018, not in 2019. he said he was certain of the date because of the parties\u2019 visit to country n \u2014 an ill-fated journey during which he says he realised how difficult the relationship had become. on his evidence, the husband says that upon their return to tasmania he informed the wife that their relationship was over. he moved into a separate bedroom at this time.[16] 62 he also referred to the wife\u2019s receipt of centrelink payments, commencing sometime after october, to support his position. no documents were produced corroborating the same. 63 the husband disputed that the wife assisted with agricultural production. he said that the farm was a hobby agriculture production, and that the wife did nothing to assist beyond \u2018looking\u2019 at the animals. he agreed that he has livestock for cash, and in agreeing so he denied that the wife was in any way involved in rearing or selling livestock. he also denied that the wife helped him collect firewood. 64 the husband denied that the wife helped him purchase or maintain the investment properties acquired during their marriage. in his view, the language barrier prevented her from conversing with real estate agents. he said that the wife may have looked at \u2018glossy photos\u2019 of properties to purchase, and did not express her contribution to acquiring these properties any higher. he agreed that the wife accompanied him to viewings, but maintained that she did not help purchase, clean or maintain the properties. 65 mrs mooney sc then questioned the husband about the wife\u2019s time in country f and suggested to him that, as shown on the wife\u2019s passport, she returned to australia in 2014, after she left in 2013. the husband replied that he would \u2018go by the passport dates\u2019. 66 it was further put to the husband that the wife spent a total of 15 months overseas during their relationship. he did not deny this, but wanted confirmation from the wife\u2019s passport. the passport was not produced at trial, nor is it annexed to the wife\u2019s affidavit. 67 it was seemingly conceded by mr tucker in final submissions that the wife\u2019s time outside of australia during the relationship totalled approximately 15 months. i note that the husband accompanied the wife for some of this total period \u2014 in 2013 and in 2016.[17] 68 the husband maintained that he funded the wife\u2019s visits to country f. he annexed bank statements to his affidavit from 2013 and 2016 evidencing cash withdrawals which, according to him, he then paid to the wife for travel purposes.[18] 69 in response to the wife\u2019s allegation of the $10,000.00 loan from ms q ngueng, the husband denied that this amount was ever advanced to him as a loan. it follows that the husband also denied that he owed $10,000.00 to ms q ngueng. 70 the husband agreed that he had received $3,000.00 from ms q ngueng, and both parties agree that this was repaid. 71 he denied that he told the wife not to work. further, he did not accept that her injury (the very existence of which he also did not accept) prevented her from working for more than one week during their marriage. 72 the husband confirmed that he receives $300.00 per year in monies by renting a sign that he owns on the area r. he had not disclosed this income in his financial statement. 73 the husband denied that the son met the wife\u2019s expenses for the country n holiday in 2018. he also denied that the wife paid for her spousal visa. as for the visa, the husband\u2019s bank statements evidence a withdrawal of $3,000.00 in 2013.[19] 74 lastly, the husband agreed that the value of his superannuation interest has increased since separation. 75 the husband was, for the most part, able to corroborate his claims about the issues in dispute. this is with the exception of evidence from centrelink in support of separation occurring in late 2018. the husband\u2019s bank statements corroborate, to some extent, his claims of certain amounts being paid to the wife. the cash withdrawals, though legitimate, offer little information as to the purpose or conclusive recipient of the funds. on this point i note that the husband was not challenged as to the purpose and recipient of the payments, and as such i may conclude that these entries corroborate such payments being made to the wife, and not for some other purpose. further, the first statement annexed does not cover the entire period in which the husband claims to have made payments to the wife. the first is dated 2013, but the husband claims he paid the wife approximately $1,000.00 per month between 2013 and 2014. 76 the husband put his evidence clearly to the court. the husband\u2019s claims were largely corroborated by other evidence and, where he offered corroboration, i generally preferred his evidence on that basis. 77 as submitted by both counsel this matter could have been argued on the papers. issues of credit will not decisively effect my determination. 78 there are some disputed, but peripheral, matters which will not significantly impact my determination as to the justice and equity of the order ultimately made under s 79 of the act. 79 finally, and most importantly, the wife accepts that the husband made significant financial contributions and the husband accepts that the wife made significant homemaking contributions.[20] submissions 80 both counsel submitted that the parties\u2019 property should be assessed in two pools \u2014 one pool containing all non-superannuation property and the other containing only superannuation property. 81 both counsel submitted that i should assess the asset pools globally, as opposed to assessing the property on an asset-by-asset basis. i intend to adopt a global approach. the wife\u2019s submissions 82 mrs mooney sc\u2019s submissions were consistent with the wife\u2019s case outline with respect to the wife\u2019s contributions and s 75(2) factors. 83 i was urged against giving only token weight to the wife\u2019s non-financial contributions, particularly those contributions made as a homemaker. the wife conceded that the husband made the majority of the financial contributions, though mrs mooney sc asked me to assess all the parties\u2019 various types of contributions throughout the relationship. 84 mrs mooney sc submitted that the husband\u2019s handsome property portfolio has increased by approximately $200,000.00 in value due to market forces. this is particularly, in the wife\u2019s submission, attributable to the properties acquired during the relationship. as such, the increase in value should not be viewed as emanating from the husband\u2019s contributions alone. the wife, being the primary homemaker during that period, contributed at a minimum to that increase in value by supporting the husband with finding and maintaining his properties. 85 it was seemingly conceded that, on the balance of probabilities, evidentiary shortcomings prevented me from finding that ms q ngueng had loaned the husband $10,000.00, or that the wife received monetary gifts from friends and family at the commencement of the relationship. 86 overall, i was asked to assess the wife\u2019s contributions at 8-15%. 87 relevant 75(2) factors to which i was referred in making my determination included the significant disparities in the parties\u2019 income and capital. 88 mrs mooney sc pointed out that the husband will retain income-generating and appreciating assets. she further submitted that, given the asset pool\u2019s relatively small net value, i should be careful not to apply small percentages to the overall outcome. this causes, as a practical result, a small dollar figure for the wife. a lesser sum merely because the asset pool has a low net value may not ultimately create a just and equitable solution. as such, i was urged to \u2018stand back\u2019 and consider whether the ultimate outcome (in dollar terms) is just and equitable.[21] 89 the wife\u2019s submissions reflects authority that \u2018the reality is to be found in the figures\u2019 \u2014 a purely mathematical approach in my assessment does not necessarily lead to a just and equitable outcome. [22] 90 mrs mooney sc also submitted consistently with authorities, developed since hickey & hickey & attorney-general for the commonwealth of australia [2003] famca 395 (\u2018hickey\u2019), as to the proper approach for determining orders under s 79. the final step of the approach in hickey is for me to stand back, as submitted on behalf of the wife, and assess whether an order is just and equitable \u2018in all the circumstances of the case\u2019.[23] that assessment is to be undertaken with respect to the parties\u2019 circumstances and the order\u2019s effect upon the actual property subject to the order, including superannuation.[24] 91 mrs mooney sc submitted that a further adjustment, between 8% and 14%, should be made in the wife\u2019s favour pursuant to s 75(2) factors. she subsequently submitted that the husband\u2019s proposal, being 10% of the total property pool, is too low. notwithstanding the relative brevity of the relationship i was urged to, overall, assess the wife\u2019s contributions as 25% excluding superannuation entitlements.[25] 92 the overall assessment of 25% in favour of the wife, excluding superannuation entitlements, equals $155,699.39 on the revised figures in exhibit \u2018a\u2019, as extracted at paragraph 35. this figure would be in addition to the 50% split of the husband\u2019s superannuation interest as agreed. the husband\u2019s submissions 93 mr tucker submitted that, given the short duration of the marriage, there should be a high level of scrutiny as to the financial contributions of the parties. this submission, given consistently with the husband\u2019s case outline, referred to the decision of lane & wharton [2010] famca 18. 94 the husband\u2019s position is that he made the overwhelming financial contributions to the marriage, noting that the wife held paid employment for one week. submissions pointed to the husband\u2019s property holdings, in that the properties he held prior to the marriage provided the equity to purchase the properties acquired during the marriage. in this way, the wife has made no (or very little) contribution to purchasing the investment properties in 2017, nor should the court recognise her as contributing to any increase in their value. 95 mr tucker conceded that it is just and equitable for the court to alter the parties\u2019 property interests, and that there was and remains an income and capital disparity between the parties. it was submitted, however, that i need to take into account the relationship\u2019s short duration. 96 it was also conceded that both parties made non-financial contributions and that weight should be given to the wife\u2019s homemaking contributions while she lived in australia. mr tucker submitted on the latter point that weight should be attributed only to those periods in which the wife lived in australia, noting that she resided outside australia for at least 15 months. 97 i was asked to reject any suggestion that the parties remained in debt to ms q ngueng in the sum of $10,000.00, or indeed in any other sum. 98 i was also asked to reject any evidence from the wife that the husband did not want her to work. in any event, it is an agreed fact that the wife only undertook paid employment during the relationship for a period of one week. 99 mr tucker\u2019s concluding submissions regarding adjustments were that, taking into account the agreed superannuation split, there should be an overall adjustment of 10% to the wife including superannuation. on a two-pool basis, mr tucker submitted that the wife should receive 5% of the non-superannuation pool and the agreed 50% of the superannuation pool. the former figure of 5% is an increase from the 2% figure previously sought by the husband in respect of the non-superannuation assets. 100 the 10% figure proposed by the husband consists of the wife\u2019s motor vehicle 1 as well as the $30,415.50 superannuation split as agreed by the parties. on the amended figures contained in exhibit \u2018a\u2019, this equals 9.004% of the total property pool. 101 in relation to the 5% of the value of the non-superannuation pool, the proposed figure of 5% differs from the 2% figure sought in paragraph 8 of the orders sought in the husband\u2019s case outline. on the amended figures set out at paragraph 35, 5% of the non-superannuation pool equals $31,139.88. this means that the husband would pay the gap of $27,614.88 between the value of the motor vehicle 1 (at $3,525.00) and the total 5% value of the non-superannuation property pool. preliminary issues 102 i will briefly address two preliminary issues before considering what, if any, order should be made. evidentiary shortcomings with respect to the $10,000.00 loan from ms q ngueng 103 the wife claims that her sister, ms q ngueng, lent money to herself and the husband on two occasions. 104 the husband agrees that, on one occasion, ms q ngueng advanced a loan of $3,000.00 to the wife which he then used and repaid. the wife agreed that the husband did so.[26] 105 the wife asserts that ms q ngueng loaned the parties a further $10,000.00, which was purportedly used by the husband and never repaid.[27] the husband denies having received this amount and, as such, denies that it is a loan for which he remains in debt. the wife did not produce evidence from ms q ngueng, nor any documentary evidence, to corroborate her claim. 106 the $3,000.00 loan was advanced in 2017, and it appears that the wife places the purported $10,000.00 loan at this point in time as well.[28] neither party produced complete banking records for this time \u2014 the husband\u2019s annexes statements with the latest date being december 2016, and the wife only annexes statements from 2021. as for the $10,000.00 loan, the husband\u2019s evidence does show a withdrawal of $10,000.00 in 2016, with a hand-written note of \u2018house\u2019 next to the entry on the statement.[29] it was not put to him that this amount represented the loan from ms q ngueng. 107 the wife must prove that the $10,000.00 loan was given, and that the debt to ms q ngueng remains outstanding for me to consider this amount in formulating orders under s 79. though she bears the onus of proof, the wife did not call witnesses or provide further evidence with respect to this issue. even ms q ngueng herself, the purported creditor of the husband, was not called as a witness. the wife was plainly in a position to call or provide such corroborative evidence and she did not explain her failure to do so. 108 this court may, in light of the wife\u2019s failure to call or provide this evidence, infer that it would not have assisted her case. in the words of lord mansfield in blatch v archer [1774] engr 2, (1774) 98 er 969: \u201call evidence is to be weighed according to the proof which it was in the power of one side to have produced, and in the power of the other side to have contradicted.\u201d[30] 109 as a \u2018particular application\u2019 of this rule, this court: \u201ccan be confident about drawing inferences against a party who has chosen not to give evidence [if] it was within the power of the party to produce evidence on that matter.\u201d[31] 110 further, as set out by murphy j in lavell & lavell [2012] famca 34: \u201c122. the \u201crule in jones v dunkel\u201d relates to the potential for an adverse inference to be drawn in circumstances where evidence presented in a case raises an inference against a party and that party is in a position to give or call evidence to refute it and does not do so. but, the \u201crule in jones v dunkel\u201d can be seen as \u201ca particular application\u201d of \u201cthe rule in blatch v archer\u201d. (see ho v powell [2001] nswca 168 per hodgson ja at [15], beazley ja agreeing). 123. the latter \u201c... applies where a person bearing the onus of proof does not give or call evidence which that person is plainly in a position to give or call, and unless some explanation is given of that failure, the tribunal of fact is entitled to infer that this evidence would not have assisted that person\u2019s case ...\u201d (ho v powell). the principle in blatch v archer can be seen as wider than the \u201crule in jones v dunkel\u201d \u201cbecause it is also available against the person bearing the onus of proof where that person does not adduce evidence that he or she was plainly in a position to adduce\u201d. (australian securities and investments commission v rich [2009] nswsc 1229 per austin j at [439].\u201d[32] 111 murphy j also extracted the following statement originating from shalhoub v buchanan [2004] nswsc 99 and repeated in subsequent authorities, including australian securities and investments commission v rich [2009] nswsc 1229: \u201c124. [t]he failure of a party who bears an onus of proof to call an available witness who could cast light on some matter in dispute can be taken into account in deciding whether that onus is discharged, in circumstances where such evidence as has been called does not itself clearly discharge the onus.\u201d [33] 112 the wife did not explain why ms q ngueng was not called as a witness, or even file an affidavit from her in relation to the alleged debt. without evidence from ms q ngueng, and with no other documentation to corroborate the claim, there is a considerable void in the wife\u2019s case as to the existence of the $10,000.00 debt to ms q ngueng. as such, i draw the inference that ms q ngueng\u2019s evidence, if called, would not have assisted the wife\u2019s case. 113 this inference being drawn prevents the wife\u2019s case, on this point, reaching the requisite standard of proof. the full standard, to which i am required to adhere, is extracted below: \u201c140 civil proceedings: standard of proof (1) in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: (a) the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject\u2011matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged.\u201d [34] in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: 114 dixon j, as he then was, also provided remarks on the standard of proof for civil proceedings in briginshaw & briginshaw [1938] hca 34, 60 clr 336, which remain relevant and authoritative: \u201cthe truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal.\u201d[35] 115 without evidence from ms q ngueng, or indeed any other corroborative evidence, the wife has failed to show on the balance of probabilities that the $10,000.00 loan was advanced, or that the debt continues to exist. 116 i do not, therefore, include the $10,000.00 in the balance sheet as a debt, nor do i take it into account as an indirect financial contribution. 117 in conclusion, for the reasons stated above the asset pool for the purpose of these proceedings is as set out at paragraph 35. the length of the relationship 118 as foreshadowed in the factual background of this case, the parties disagree as to when their relationship commenced and concluded. 119 the husband claims that the relationship commenced in 2013 and concluded in in 2019, a total of 5 years and 9 months. the wife claims that the relationship commenced in 2012 and concluded in 2019, a total of 6 years and 6 months. 120 counsel did not explore this issue in any great detail during cross-examination, and no third party evidence was adduced to support one position over another. 121 whether the relationship lasted 6 years and 6 months or 5 years and 9 months is, largely, a distinction without a difference insofar as it affects any alteration of the parties\u2019 property interests. nevertheless, i will address each of the parties\u2019 contentions. 122 in relation to the parties commencing cohabitation, the wife says in her affidavit that the husband invited her to live with him in tasmania.[36] she gives no evidence as to the nature of the relationship before their marriage in 2013. the husband\u2019s evidence sets out, to a degree, the nature of their relationship between their first meeting and their marriage in 2013. he describes that they met in mid-2012 when the wife was visiting city l and they became closer over the following 7-8 months, with the wife staying at his home 1-2 nights per week before moving in permanently in 2013.[37] 123 as the husband has provided a fuller description of the parties\u2019 early relationship, i am inclined to accept his evidence about the time at which the relationship commenced. it may well be that the wife interpreted her once or twice-weekly visits to the husband\u2019s home as being a de facto relationship, but there is no evidence supporting this view. 124 i find that cohabitation commenced in 2013, and that this constitutes the start of the relationship for the purposes of these proceedings. 125 in relation to the date of separation, the husband\u2019s account is that he told the wife that their relationship was over upon their return from country n in 2018.[38] the husband agrees that the wife continued to live in the former matrimonial home until mid-2019, albeit separated under one roof. 126 the wife, on the other hand, says that the parties separated in 2019.[39] she describes that the husband asked her to collect rent for him at this time.[40] the husband\u2019s evidence does not contest this, nor did he challenge it at trial. 127 that the wife collected rent on the husband\u2019s behalf is consistent with an ongoing relationship between them. the evidence reveals, however, that their relationship was clearly strained by 2019. this, again, was uncontested by the husband. 128 the wife describes that, in 2019, police were contacted to handle alleged incidents of family violence at the former matrimonial home. these incidents included the husband allegedly removing the wife\u2019s number plates from her car, along with other allegations.[41] 129 the husband\u2019s account is that he told her the relationship was at an end after the country n trip,[42] and had little to do with her after that time.[43] while the relationship may well have been in its final throes in 2019, the wife continued to undertake tasks on his behalf. further, the husband\u2019s long working hours during this period seemingly minimised communication between the parties.[44] this is likely the final form in which the relationship existed \u2014 an impersonal connection with a palpable feeling of its looming demise. 130 the evidence before me indicates that, between 2018 and 2019, the relationship dwindled over a few months and finally ended in 2019. it was in 2019 that the tensions, as described by the wife, started to rise. the wife\u2019s evidence is consistent with such a scenario. 131 for the reasons stated i find on the balance of probabilities that the relationship commenced on in 2013 and remained intact until 2019. this is a total period of approximately 6 years. property settlement \u2014 principles 132 foster j in lotta & lotta [2017] famca 50 explains the considerations to which a court must direct itself in assessing the justice and equity of an order, and the process by which a court undertakes the inquiry: \u201c281. the approach to the determination of an application under s 79 of the act is set out in stanford v stanford [2012] hca 52 and further considered by the full court in bevan & bevan [2014] famcafc 19, chapman & chapman [2014] famcafc 91 and scott & danton [2014] famcafc 203. 282. the court must identify the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property, the liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the time of the hearing and then whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order. 283. such a consideration should not be guided by an assumption that the parties\u2019 rights to or interests in property are or should be different from those that then exist. the question is whether those rights and interests should be altered. 284. there is no presumption that one or other party has the right to have the property of the parties divided between them or a right to an interest in marital property that is fixed by reference to the various matters in s 79(4). the court needs to conclude that it would be unjust or unfair to leave property rights intact under s 79(2) of the act. 285. in many cases this requirement is readily satisfied where the parties are no longer in a marital or de facto relationship and, thus, for example, the common ownership or use of property by husband and wife will no longer be possible or the express or implicit assumptions that underpinned existing property arrangements such as the accumulation of assets or financial resources by one for the benefit of both have been brought to an end with the relationship. 286. in particular, such a circumstance arises where both parties seek property adjustment orders but are unable to agree as to same. here the wife seeks an order for adjustment of property and the husband contends that there should be no such adjustment. 287. it is thus important to ascertain the present property and resources of the parties so as to facilitate a consideration of the s 79(2) question. 288. in some circumstances it is not possible to determine whether it is just and equitable to make adjustment orders as to the parties present property rights without a consideration of s 79 (4) matters. 289. section 79(4) requires a consideration of the contributions made by the parties as defined in s 79(4)(a) to (c). the court must then consider s 79(4)(d) to (g) in particular the subjective considerations as to the parties by having regard to the provisions of s 75(2) in so far as they are relevant (s 79(4)(e)). 290. the court can then consider the \u201cjustice and equity\u201d of the actual orders to be made: russell & russell [1999] famca 1875, (1999) flc 92-877, teal & teal [2010] famcafc 120, in the context of the court\u2019s obligation to make \u201cappropriate orders\u201d as provided for in s 79(1) of the act.\u201d [45] 133 section 79(4) of the act states that in considering what order (if any) should be made pursuant to s 79(1), this court should take into account: \u201c(a) the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last\u2011mentioned property, whether or not that last\u2011mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, and (b) the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last\u2011mentioned property, whether or not that last\u2011mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, and (c) the contribution made by a party to the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the marriage and any children of the marriage, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent, and (d) the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the marriage, and (e) the matters referred to in subsection 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and (f) any other order made under this act affecting a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage, and (g) any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the marriage has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the marriage.\u201d the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last\u2011mentioned property, whether or not that last\u2011mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, and (c) the

to the marriage has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the marriage.\u201d 134 section 79(4)(e) requires this court to consider the factors set out at s 75(2), as far as they are relevant to altering the parties\u2019 proprietary interests. the matters to be taken into account under s 75(2), extracted in full, are: \u201c(a) the age and state of health of each of the parties, and (b) the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment, and

parties\u2019 contributions 135 the husband concedes that it is just and equitable for there to be an order altering the parties\u2019 interests in the property of the relationship. 136 the high court in stanford & stanford [2012] hca 52, 247 clr 108 insists that interference with legal and equitable interests of parties must adhere to principled reason.[46] the principles to which this court may have reference include, but are not limited to, \u2018those principles which the act itself lays down\u2019.[47] justice and equity, with respect to property settlement, does not admit to an exhaustive definition and it is \u2018not possible to chart its metes and bounds\u2019.[48] 137 the principles contained within the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u2018the act\u2019) also accommodate \u2018stated or unstated assumptions and agreements about property interests during the continuance of the marriage\u2019.[49] it is just and equitable, according to stanford & stanford, for a court to make a property settlement order if such agreements or assumptions with respect to marital property interests during the marriage have been brought to an end, which usually occurs with the end of the marriage. 138 i take into account that this marriage was one of nearly 6 years. during that time the wife, on the admission of the husband, made contributions by way of homemaking.[50] 139 the wife has left the marriage without any significant income, and in circumstances where she has been wholly reliant upon the husband\u2019s income during the relationship. the wife is not employed, speaks almost entirely in language 1, and does not have financial means of support except for her centrelink allowance.[51] 140 i am satisfied that it is just and equitable for an order to be made altering the parties\u2019 property interests. 141 the following sections assess the parties\u2019 contributions under s 79(4), and then consider whether adjustments should be made pursuant to the factors under s 75(2). section 79(4)(a) \u2013 financial contributions 142 both parties agree that the husband has made the overwhelming financial contributions to the marriage. 143 the husband was employed fulltime throughout the marriage and there is no dispute that he contributed those funds to the relationship. the husband currently earns $1916.12 per week.[52] 144 the wife was employed for a period of one week during the relationship.[53] the parties disagree as to why the wife was not employed beyond this one week of employment. the wife alleges that this was a joint decision between the parties. the husband denies this. regardless of which perspective forms the truth, the fact is that the wife did not make any financial contribution to the marriage other than that gained from her one week of employment. 145 the wife gave evidence under cross-examination that she received gifts of money at the time of the marriage that were contributed to the relationship. this evidence is not contained in her affidavit material. the wife does refer in her affidavit to financial assistance from her family and money from her divorce settlement, prior to the relationship commencing.[54] the husband denies that the wife brought funds into the relationship. 146 given the late revelation by the wife of this purported contribution, and the lack of corroborating evidence, i do not find this assertion proved on the balance of probabilities and refer to my preliminary evidentiary finding above.[55] 147 the parties received the benefits of a loan from ms q ngueng, the wife\u2019s sister. with respect to a loan of $3,000.00, funds obtained via the wife, which was used by the husband. this loan was repaid by him. the funds were obtained from ms q ngueng via the wife which, while this is an indirect financial contribution, it is of minor impact. 148 the wife also claims that she paid for her trips to country f and for her spousal visa. the husband claims he paid for them. the wife under cross-examination referred to her son providing some financial assistance to fund her trips away. he was not called as a witness. i infer that his evidence, if called, would not have assisted the wife\u2019s case. in this respect i again refer to the rule in blatch & archer, and its application in australia, as set out specifically at paragraphs 103 \u2013 117 of these reasons. 149 further, the wife does not particularise how she paid for her trips away in her affidavit. the wife simply denies that the husband assisted her financially.[56] 150 the wife does not explain how she funded these trips in circumstances where she agrees that she did not have paid employment during the relationship, other than for one week. further, the husband annexes to his affidavit bank statements which he says evidence the cash withdrawals of significant sums used to meet the wife\u2019s costs of her trips away. the husband was not challenged in relation to this evidence.[57] 151 on the balance of probabilities i accept the husband\u2019s evidence that he funded the wife\u2019s trips overseas in the manner he describes in his affidavit, and that he paid for the wife\u2019s spousal visa. 152 significantly, the husband brought into the relationship a number of properties.[58] those properties were used as security to purchase additional properties during the relationship, as set out at paragraphs 25 \u2013 27 of these reasons. 153 the husband\u2019s direct and indirect financial contributions were overwhelmingly greater than the wife\u2019s and must be given significant weight. section 79(4)(b) \u2013 contributions other than financial contributions 154 the wife asserts that she provided non-financial contributions throughout the relationship, including assisting the husband in finding viewing and maintain rental properties that were purchased, assisting with agricultural production and assisting generally on the matrimonial home. the husband disagrees.[59] 155 the wife did not call her son who she claims helped clean and maintain the investment properties.[60] the wife\u2019s assertion of son\u2019s assistance went unsupported and, again, i refer to my evidentiary findings above and the rule in blatch & archer. 156 conversely, the husband did not challenge the wife\u2019s evidence that she collected rent in 2019. he does not challenge the detail that the wife sets out regarding the use of those rental monies.[61] this suggests the wife was involved in these projects to a greater extent than the husband is willing to admit. 157 the evidence from each party represents their own perspectives. i accept that the wife views her contributions, namely assisting the husband as described in her affidavit, as important. the husband, from his perspective, did not find these contributions helpful or substantial. 158 i prefer the wife\u2019s evidence in this regard. the husband essentially concedes that the wife was the primary homemaker.[62] the husband worked full time. the assistance with livestock and working on the farm is consistent with her general role during the relationship. i accept on the balance of probabilities that the wife provided support in relation to purchasing rental properties and on the farm. these contributions were minimal, but they were not nothing. providing a partner with support, particularly in relation to investment decisions, is, of itself, an important contribution. 159 i find that the husband and the wife have both made non-financial contributions, to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of the parties\u2019 property. section 79(4)(c) \u2013 the contribution made by a party to the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the marriage and any children of the marriage, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent 160 the husband accepts, that when the wife was living in australia, she was predominantly responsible for the homemaking duties associated with the relationship.[63] the wife concedes that she lived in country f for approximately 15 months of the parties\u2019 relationship. the husband did, however, spend time with the wife in country f, country n and country m during these periods.[64]. 161 the wife states in her affidavit that: \u201c[d]uring the course of mine and mr yancey\u2019s relationship i was responsible for all home duties such as cooking, cleaning, laundry and general house upkeep. i also took care of the plants and vegetables at c road. i also assisted mr yancey in performing tasks around the farm, such as feeding animals.\u201d[65] 162 the wife\u2019s homemaking contributions should not be given token weight. in valuing a home maker\u2019s contribution courts must recognise that this may be given weight under s 79(4)(c) and s 79(4)(b).in dawes & dawes [1989] famca 71 (\u2018dawes\u2019), the full court stated: \u201c73. although it is difficult, as it always is in such cases, to put one's finger squarely on what led his honour to so undervalue the wife's contribution, we think that one significant matter which did so was that he failed to give any weight to the fact that the wife's performance of her role as homemaker and parent during the 30 years of cohabitation was not just a contribution under s.79(4)(c) (which he subsequently recognized to some degree) but was also a significant contribution under s.79(4)(b). that point was made by the full court (nicholson, c.j., murray and buckley, jj.) in in the marriage of napthali (1988) 13 fam lr 146 at p 151, where their honours said:- \"turning now to the second ground of appeal, (which was that 'the court erred in law in failing to take into account contributions made by the wife during the marriage as homemaker and parent') it is apparent that nowhere in her honour's judgment does she consider the contribution of the wife to the business assets as a home-maker and parent. it is clear that the wife did perform this role and nowhere in the evidence or in the submissions was any criticism directed at her capacities in this regard. it is to be noted that in mallet v. mallet [1984] hca 21, (1984) 9 fam lr 449, (1984) flc 91-507, the high court whilst rejecting the proposition of a presumption of equality, approved statements by this court that the purpose of s 79(4)(b) is to give recognition to the position of the housewife who by her attention to the home and the children frees her husband to earn income and acquire assets and also approved the proposition that the contribution made by the wife as a home-maker and parent should be recognised not in a token way but in a substantial way: see gibbs c.j. at fam lr 451, flc 79,111, mason j. at fam lr 461-2, flc 119-20.\u201d[66] 163 the wife\u2019s predominant role as the homemaker was an important contribution during the parties\u2019 marriage, and i weigh it according to its importance and the remarks in dawes above. section 79(4)(d) \u2013 the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the marriage 164 the full court in beck & beck [1983] famca 7, (1983) flc 91-318 defined \u2018earning capacity\u2019 for the purposes of s 75(2)(k), applicable the act generally, as: \u201ca capacity to obtain income which could be used to provide maintenance ... and not merely as current income from personal exertion or from the use of personal skills.\u201d[67] 165 as it stands the husband has far more capacity to obtain income than the wife. both parties sought orders of the same general nature, being for the wife to retain her car, receive 50% of the husband\u2019s superannuation interest and receive payment according to an assessment and adjustment of contributions. such an order will not affect the parties\u2019 earning capacity in the meaning outlined above. 166 i note that where a party holds assets capable of producing income, whether or not those assets do, in fact, produce income is irrelevant to \u2018earning capacity\u2019 for current purposes. that party\u2019s earning capacity is the \u2018capacity to earn the amount which those assets reasonably invested or utilised would produce\u2019[68] 167 at trial neither party sought any adjustment to the parties\u2019 real property interests. as such, the proposed orders do not affect the parties\u2019 earning capacity associated with income-producing assets. 168 the proposed orders will not impact on the earning capacity of husband. the wife\u2019s financial circumstances will be improved by the order and may enhance her earning capacity if she is able to use some of the monies to improve her english and undertake training, making her more employable. section 79(4)(e) \u2013 the matters referred to in subsection 75(2) so far as they are relevant 169 this factor is addressed in paragraphs 188 \u2013 228. section 79(4)(f) \u2013 any order made under this act affecting a party to the marriage or a child of the marriage 170 this factor is irrelevant. section 79(4)(g) \u2013 any child support under the child support (assessment) act 1989 that a party to the marriage has provided, is to provide, or might be liable to provide in the future, for a child of the marriage 171 this factor is irrelevant. conclusion regarding contributions 172 the full court in jabour & jabour [2019] famcafc 78 (\u2018jabour\u2019) considered the way in which contributions are to be assessed and, in doing so, considered a number of case authorities. the court cited and extracted the following from wallis & manning [2017] famcafc 14, in which the wife appealed a property order on the basis that the primary judge did not afford her contributions sufficient weight: \u201c110. the approach adopted by the parties before her honour is repeated in the supplementary submissions filed on behalf of the respondent husband, it is there asserted that \u201cthe contributions of the parties would be equal aside from gifting by the husband\u2019s father of significant parcels of land which remain in existence at the present point in time\u201d. counsel for the wife, in his further submissions, makes no such specific assertion but implicitly does so by relying upon the trial judge\u2019s findings and manner of assessment. for the reasons given earlier, we reject that approach, the gifts by the husband\u2019s father should be taken into account as a contribution together with the miscellany of other contributions made by each of the parties over the course of their marriage.\u201d[69] 173 the full court also noted that wallis & manning said, consistently, that: \u201c20. yet, that approach must also ensure that the \u201cmyriad of other contributions\u201d and the duration over which, and circumstances in which, the miscellany of other s 79(4) contributions were made is not accorded a subsidiary role. the essential s 79(4) task is for \u201ctrial judges [to] weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation.\u201d[70] 174 the full court cited also dickons & dickons [2012] famcafc 154 (\u2018dickons\u2019), which \u2018expressly rejected the notion that there must be a relationship between contributions and what they produced in terms of property\u2019:[71] \u201c14. as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of l a and e a pierce (1998) 24 fam lr 377, (1999) flc 92-844, [1998] famca 74) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial \u201cproduct\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all.\u201d[72] 175 dickons explains, consistently with the words of s 79 of the act, that: \u201c15. the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a)which refers to financial contributions made \u201c...directly or indirectly...\u201d\u201c...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...\u201d and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made \u201c...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...\u201d the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the \u201cfinancial product\u201d which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable \u2014 or, at least, conceptualised \u2014 in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). 16. while that apparent \u201ccausal connection\u201d might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the \u201c...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...\u201d or, indeed, to \u201cproperty\u201d at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the currents 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to: ... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse\u2019s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ... 17. within that context, then, it is self-evident that financial contributions (whether direct or indirect) can be made to a relationship that have an effect on the property of the parties without those financial contributions finding their way directly into, or being directly linked to, specific property or, indeed, directly to the totality of the property available for distribution at the time of trial. financial contributions can be made to the \u201c...acquisition, conservation or improvement...\u201d of property \u201c...directly or indirectly...\u201d (s 79(4)(a). emphasis added). a financial contribution can be made indirectly by, for example, the use by parties of income or assets for purpose a freeing up the use of other income or assets for purpose b. moreover, a particular financial contribution might have been used wholly in discretionary expenditure which, but for that contribution, would not have been available to the parties or would have required borrowings or a diminution of capital. such a contribution can also, in that way, be seen, for example, as an indirect contribution to the conservation of property. indeed, the principles discussed for example in in the marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70 and townsend [1994] famca 144, can be seen as an exception to that general proposition. 18. any and all such contributions, whether or not they sound in, or are directly linked to, the property available for distribution, should be considered and assessed together with the nature, form and extent of all other contributions of all types contemplated otherwise by s 79(4). 19. that is true of assets or income generated within the relationship and it is equally true of assets or income coming from outside of the relationship (for example, as here, in the form of inheritances). in the same way, s 79(4) specifically requires the court to take into account contributions made to the welfare of the family (and substantively and \u201c...not in any merely token way...\u201d, see, mallett v mallett (1984) 156 clr 605 at 636, [1946] arguslawrp 6, 52 alr 193 at 218, 9 fam lr 449 at 471 per wilson j) notwithstanding that those contributions may not be, or cannot be seen to be, directly linked to the available property at trial, or any increase or decrease in the value of the property. 20. put another way, consistent with authority, the s 79 discretion involves as a necessary requirement that \u201c... trial judges weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such an assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties or provide for a transfer of property in specie in accordance with that assessment.\u201d (in the marriage of v and g aleksovski ([1996] famca 111, 1996) 20 fam lr 894 at 903, (1996) flc 92-705 at 83,437). in aleksovski, kay j outlined the well-known \u201cgold bar\u201d analogy and said \u201c[w]hat is important is to somehow give a reasonable value to all of the elements that go to making up the entirety of the marriage relationship\u201d (at fam lr 910, flc 83,443). 21. those same principles can be expressed as saying that the requirements of the section are met by approaching the assessment of contributions holistically and by analysing the nature, form, characteristics and origin of the property currently comprising that to which s 79 applies, and, in turn, analysing the nature, form and extent of the contributions (of all types) contemplated by s 79). that task is also undertaken by reference to the nature and form of the particular marriage partnership manifested by the particular circumstances of this particular marriage. is it, for example, a relationship, as deane j put it in mallett at clr 640\u2013 1, alr 222, fam lr 473 \u201c...where the parties have adopted the attitude that their marriage constituted a practical union of both lives and property...\u201d or is it, for example, a union where parties lived very separate domestic and financial lives?\u201d[73] 176 the approach to assessing contributions under s 79 is often explained (and even more frequently embarked upon) by courts. yet, the undertaking remains complex and rich with possibilities of error. in jabour, the full court noted the ways in which the trial judge erred in weighing the contributions of the parties: \u201c73. as can be sees the primary judge weighed the myriad contributions made by the parties against the contribution made by the husband in bringing in property a rather than treating property a as one of the myriad contributions made.\u201d[74] 177 this approach had the effect of the contributions of the wife in that case being overlooked,[75] including those contributions \u2018made in the course of a long marriage during which both parties worked very hard and raised a family\u2019.[76] 178 this was a relationship of 6 years. it is for this reason that, for short relationships, a court may more readily assess contributions on an asset-by-asset basis instead of with reference to the global asset pool. the high court confirmed in norbis & norbis [1986] hca 17, 161 clr 513 that: \u201c[w]hich of the two approaches is the more convenient will depend on the circumstances of the particular case. however, there is much to be said for the view that in most cases the global approach is the more convenient. it follows that the full court is quite entitled to prescribe that approach as a guideline in order to promote uniformity of approach within the court.\u201d[77] 179 the words of s 79 do not impose any obligation to follow either approach but the court\u2019s discretion is, of course, subject to the s 79(4) considerations, the justice and equity of the order, and the relevant principles in ss 43 and 81.[78] 180 notwithstanding the short duration of the marriage neither counsel requested that i take an asset-by-asset approach in assessing the parties\u2019 contributions. 181 in all of the circumstances i am satisfied that i can reach just and equitable property orders by assessing contributions globally to the entire non-superannuation pool. 182 the non-superannuation property pool, having a net total of $622,797.57, is made up in no small part by the investment properties purchased in 2017 and set out at paragraph 27 of these reasons. the parties agree that, during the relationship, market forces appear to have boosted the value of these properties by approximately $200,000.00. 183 during this period of time, the wife contributed to the relationship particularly as a homemaker. that said, the purchase of investment properties in 2017 would not have been possible but for the husband\u2019s equity in the properties he brought into the relationship. further, the husband\u2019s income met the mortgage payments in respect of those properties. the wife undertaking the predominant share of homemaking duties undoubtedly afforded the husband with time, space and incentive to purchase the properties acquired during the relationship. 184 consistent with jabour and dickons,[79] the parties\u2019 contributions to the non-superannuation property pool are not weighed according to whether they in fact produced a gain. a contribution without any identifiable positive impact upon the property pool is not justifiably disregarded on that basis. while the husband\u2019s contributions may be more readily identifiable as \u2018causing\u2019 the increase to the property pool, the wife\u2019s contributions in this regard cannot be ignored. 185 further, the husband made the overwhelming financial contributions to the relationship in general. the wife, again in fulfilling the homemaker role, has also meaningfully contributed during the relationship. 186 that the parties\u2019 relationship lasted 6 years distinguishes it from cases such as jabour, in which the parties were married for 27 years. i also accept that the wife spent approximately 15 months during the relationship outside of australia. the husband consented to the wife spending months away from the matrimonial home, and accompanied her overseas at times. nevertheless, there were times while the wife was away that she did not make any homemaking or other contributions to the marriage. 187 considering the myriad of contributions made by both parties during their short marriage, i assess the wife\u2019s contribution at 7% of the total net non-superannuation property pool. section 75(2) factors section 75(2)(a) \u2014 the age and state of health of each of the parties 188 the husband is 52 years of age, and the wife is 58 years of age. neither party appears to have health issues which impact their capacity to perform employed work. 189 the wife has suffered a medical condition but appears to be in remission.[80] 190 the wife states in her affidavit that her general practitioner has advised her that \u2018realistically, [she] will not be able to work for at least two years\u2019.[81] she annexed a medical certificate from dr s dated 7 may 2021 purportedly proving the same.[82] the medical certificate is hearsay evidence, and dr s was not called and therefore was not cross-examined on its contents. the certificate is a business record and thus admissible as an exception to the hearsay rule.[83] 191 regardless of admissibility, dr s\u2019s evidence does not corroborate the wife\u2019s assertion that she would not be able to work for at least two years. the certificate was prepared for, and provided to, centrelink in support of an exemption from engaging with a job provider, and stated that the wife was unfit for work from 6 may 2021 until 6 august 2021. [84] this is not a period of 2 years. the wife was not, however, challenged on her claim in this regard. 192 nevertheless, the wife\u2019s ability to work is affected by her limited understanding of english and her absence from the workforce for many years. the wife does not appear to have any qualifications with which she could easily obtain regular paid employment. section 75(2)(b) \u2014 the income, property and financial resources of each of the parties and the physical and mental capacity of each of them for appropriate gainful employment 193 neither party seeks an order transferring any property from the husband to the wife. the husband will, therefore, retain five properties as a result of this property settlement. these assets not only produce income, but should continue to appreciate in value over time. 194 the husband earns approximately $100,000.00 per annum.[85] both parties will retain the same level of superannuation. as stated above, the wife\u2019s capacity for gainful employment is affected by her age, her limited understanding of english and her absence from paid employment for many years. the parties remain in disagreement as to why the wife was not employed \u2014 the wife says it was a joint decision and the husband denies this. the reality is that the wife did not work during the relationship, which at present has had a negative impact upon her ability to obtain gainful employment post-separation. 195 in the decision of mitchell & mitchell [1995] famca 32, (1995) flc 92-601, the full court considered the impact of separation upon women: \u201cimportantly, and particularly in more recent times, there is the notorious circumstance that there is a significant gap between theory and reality for employment, especially for people in middle age, lacking experience and confidence, and who have been out of the skilled work-force for many years, and in the context of current high unemployment. loss of security, missed promotion opportunities, loss of retraining in developing skills in an increasingly skilled work-force with the loss of confidence which this brings, particularly in times of high unemployment, are notorious circumstances of which the court must take notice and apply in a realistic way. in this regard, we refer to the detailed analysis of comparable problems in canada by the supreme court of canada in moge v moge (1992) 43 rfl (3d.) 345 and the discussion by this full court in best, supra, esp. at 80, 295 and the reference in those cases to the \"feminization of poverty\" and to some of the numerous articles upon that subject both here and overseas to that time. for useful articles discussing the judgment in moge see also toward an equitable distribution of resources: support after moge and moge (1994) 16 advocates quarterly 452 and equality and support for spouses (1994) 57 mod.l.r. 681. moge, supra, was drawn to counsels\u2019 attention in the course of the appeal but neither presented argument about it. we are conscious of the circumstance that the supreme court emphasized that its decision was predominantly a matter of statutory interpretation of the relevant provisions of the canadian divorce act 1985 and in these circumstances we think it would be inappropriate in this appeal for us to analyse the decision itself further. there is, however, one feature of that decision which we think it is relevant to highlight \u2013 the application of the doctrine of judicial notice. the majority judgment delivered by l'heureux-dube j recorded a range of studies and commentaries concerning the general economic impact of divorce upon women. her honour said at 393-4:- \"based upon the studies which i have cited earlier in these reasons, the general economic impact of divorce on women is a phenomenon, the existence of which cannot reasonably be questioned and should be amenable to judicial notice. more extensive social science data are also appearing. such studies are beginning to provide reasonable assessments of some of the disadvantages incurred and advantages conferred post-divorce (see, for example, the study by kerr (an economic model to assist in the determination of spousal support, paper prepared for the department of justice and status of women canada, 1992)). while quantification will remain difficult and fact-related in each particular case, judicial notice should be taken of such studies, subject to other expert evidence which may bear on them, as background information at the very least. (...) in all events, whether judicial notice of the circumstances generally encountered by spouses at the dissolution of marriage is to be part of the trial process or whether such circumstances merely provide the necessary background information, it is important that judges be aware of the social reality in which support decisions are experienced when engaging in the examination of the objectives of the act.\"[86] 196 these comments, in my view, have application to the social reality of someone who has not worked for many years and has the added barrier of not speaking english well. 197 the wife is financially vulnerable as she confronts many barriers to obtaining a reliable and reasonable income. i take into account under this factor her financial vulnerability. section 75(2)(d) \u2014 commitments of each of the parties necessary to enable them to support themselves and a child or another person that the party has a duty to maintain 198 the parties\u2019 financial statements do not reveal, in any great detail, their necessary commitments. 199 during the proceedings, on 15 july 2020, the wife obtained an order for spousal maintenance in the sum of $250.00 per week. counsel for the wife submitted, in opening, that the spousal maintenance payments ceased by agreement because the husband had taken on the payment of all of the parties\u2019 debt, including credit card and mortgage payments. as a result, the husband did not have the financial capacity to make any further payment to the wife. i draw from this that the husband\u2019s income is devoted, almost entirely, to the expenses associated with his debts and living expenses. the wife, meanwhile, finds it challenging to make ends meet with her centrelink allowance. 200 the husband, by comparison to the wife\u2019s position, has a strong income. this places him in a better position than the wife to meet the necessary commitments of himself resulting from the orders that this court will make. section 75(2)(f) \u2014 subject to subsection (3), the eligibility of either party for a pension, allowance or benefit under any law or superannuation fund, and the rate of any such pension, allowance or benefit being paid to either party 201 the wife receives the centrelink newstart allowance (now referred to as the \u2018jobseeker\u2019 allowance) in the amount of $635.80 per fortnight.[87] the wife was receiving the coronavirus supplement, in the amount of an additional $550.00 per fortnight, but this payment has since ceased. 202 the husband, on the other hand, has income producing assets and receives $1,912.96 per week from working full-time as a factory hand.[88] the husband has worked for the same employer for 32 years.[89] 203 the husband\u2019s financial future is far more secure than the wife\u2019s. 204 the husband and the wife have agreed to divide equally the husband\u2019s small superannuation entitlement of $60,831.72. 205 the husband agreed under cross-examination that his balance is likely to have increased since 1 september 2020, being the date of his statement annexed to his affidavit.[90] 206 the husband has the ability to add to his small superannuation holding, given his ongoing employment. he is likely able to accumulate a reasonable level of superannuation if he continues to work until retirement age. the wife, conversely, is unlikely to add significantly to the small amount of superannuation she will receive. 207 it is noted that the husband cashed in $80,000 of his superannuation in 2017, which was invested into the marriage, and used to pay living expenses when he was recovering from an injury.[91] section 75(2)(g) \u2014 a standard of living that in all the circumstances is reasonable 208 the parties did not adduce a great deal of evidence concerning their relative standards of living. i assume that, by virtue of his greater income and his asset holdings, the husband\u2019s financial circumstances and standard of living are stronger than that of the wife. section 75(2)(j) \u2014 the extent to which a party has contributed to the income, earning capacity, property and financial resources of the other party 209 both parties contributed to each other\u2019s income, earning capacity, property and financial resources during their marriage. the wife, through her homemaking contributions, allowed the husband to devote more time and energy to his work and other projects. the husband, in turn, has provided the wife with the opportunity to share in the assets of the relationship, which have seen an increase in value throughout the relationship. section 75(2)(k) \u2014 the duration of the marriage and the extent to which it has affected the earning capacity of each party 210 as set out at paragraphs 118 \u2013 131 above, the relationship lasted approximately 6 years. 211 the relationship did not affect the husband\u2019s earning capacity. he continues to work full time, as he did prior to the relationship\u2019s commencement. the relationship may have impacted the wife\u2019s earning capacity, as she did not work or undertake training during the relationship. 212 as stated previously in these reasons, there remains disagreement as to why the wife did not seek or obtain further employment during the relationship. notwithstanding this disagreement, the evidence establishes that the wife did in fact spend time out of the workforce for the entirety of the relationship except for one week. 213 on the evidence, it appears that the husband did not object to the wife not undertaking paid employment during the marriage. the implicit agreement between them appeared to be that the wife was the homemaker and the husband earned the income. a consequence of this was that the wife did not improve her skills, nor did she undertake training that may have assisted her to find employment post separation. that said, the wife\u2019s poor skill base and language barriers existed prior to the relationship\u2019s commencement. 214 i cannot ignore that this was a short marriage of 6 years, with the wife spending over a year of that period outside of australia. 215 both parties referred me to lane & wharton [2010] famca 18, in which watts j explored the authorities on contributions during short marriages in which there is significant financial disparity between the parties: \u201cdisparity in financial circumstances and the duration of the marriage: ss 75(2)(b) and ss 75(2)(k) 158. in farmer and bramley (2002) flc 93-060 kay j discussed guest j\u2019s analysis of s.75(2) considerations and said at paragraph 71:- \u201cthe manner in which s 75(2)(b) can be utilised to bring about an adjustment of property interests was discussed fully in collins (1990) flc 92-149 by ellis, fogarty and gun jj. there their honour's upheld nygh j's judgment making an adjustment of $1,000,000 in favour of a wife, who already owned assets worth more than that sum. nygh j had specifically identified a disparity in capital as a basis for making that adjustment. my apologies for setting out such an extensive passage but it seems to me to put to rest any suggestion that there can only be an adjustment under s 75(2)(b) if there is some causal nexus between the disparity and the marriage itself\u201d 159. kay j then extensively quoted from collins (1990) flc 92-149 and at paragraph 94 of the judgment his honour concluded that the disparity in capital positions of the parties reached as a result of the distribution on contributions (at step 2) is a matter that can be taken into account (by inference under s.75(2)(b)). that is, his honour disagreed with guest j\u2019s proposition that there had to be a connection between the capital position of the parties and the life of the marriage before weight could be placed upon a disparity in the financial positions of the parties in the balancing exercise. 160. more recently in gbt & bjt (supra) the full court (kay, holden and warnick jj), without specifically rejoining the debate emphasised that when giving weight to sub section 75(2)(b) fla, the other subsections of s.75(2) fla including subsection 75(2)(k) fla also have to be weighed. 161. at paragraph 64 of gbt & bjt the full court said: \u201cwe are inclined to the view that, in addressing the weight to be given to the disparity in the parties\u2019 incomes and earning capacities, his honour may well have given insufficient weight to the shortness of the marriage (relevant under section 75(2)(k)) and to the minimal nature of the wife\u2019s contributions, particularly having regard to the fact that such contributions as she did make were mainly in the homemaker sphere, the husband paid for the provision of a great deal of domestic assistance, and there were no children of the parties (relevant under section 75(2)(j)).\u201d 162. earlier in kennon [1997] famca 27, (1997) flc 92-757, fogarty & lindenmayer jj when dealing with 75(2) factors said of the facts in that case at page 84,303: \u201con the one side, there are circumstances that this was a relatively short marriage, with no children, and the wife is able to continue employment of the type which she had previous to cohabitation....on the other hand, there are huge differences between the parties\u2019 incomes, assets, future income-earning capacities and superannuation benefits. his honour pointed out on a number of occasions that these differences existed at the time the parties commenced to live together and that if their paths had not crossed and if they had not lived together for five years it is likely that the difference would have remained the same. however, we are not persuaded that that is the beginning and end of the issues. whilst we acknowledge that section 79 is not a source of social engineering or as a means of evening up of the financial positions of the parties to the marriage, (see, for example clauson & clauson (1995) flc 92-545, waters and jurek (1995) flc 92-635 and lyon and bradshaw (full court 16 may 1997, not yet reported)), nevertheless the fact is that these parties were married for a not insignificant period, each made contributions which we have discussed and their obligations to each other do not cease on separation. their marriage carried with it advantages and obligations and, so far as the settlement of their property on separation or divorce is concerned, those obligations are to be determined in accordance with the detailed provisions of s.79.\u201d 163. the \u201cnot insignificant period\u201d of the kennon marriage was seven years. 164 in 2007 the median duration of an unsuccessful marriage to date of separation was 8.9 years. in 1984 it had been 7.7 years. 165. in this case the cohabitation 5 years. so, the parties\u2019 marriage is on the shorter side of median duration.\u201d[92] 216 as an aside, i note gbt & bjt [2005] famca 683 as an example of a successful appeal and subsequent re-exercise of the discretion under s 79. that case also involved a 6 year marriage in which the husband made the overwhelming financial contributions. the wife made very little contribution, including as a homemaker. she worked throughout the relationship, but did not financially contribute to the relationship in any great measure. upon separation, the wife re-partnered and earned a strong income, albeit not as much as her former husband. 217 the full court in gbt & bjt ordered that the wife receive 10% of the property pool, being 7.5% for contributions and 2.5% for adjustment under the s 75(2) factors. in making the adjustment of 2.5% the court took into account that the wife had partnered and that she earned a comfortable income.[93] the full court\u2019s order was markedly different from that of the primary judge, who concluded that the wife should receive 17.5% of the parties\u2019 net property. that figure consisted of 12.5% for contributions and 5% for the s 75(2) factors.[94] 218 the aspects of gbt & bjt concerning the wife\u2019s contributions and other relevant factors clearly diverge from the facts with which i am currently faced. 219 gbt & bjt and lane & wharton both indicate that courts must act pragmatically when assessing entitlements between parties to short relationships. with respect to childless marriages of less than median length, watts j stated that: \u201c[t]here has to be a higher level of scrutiny of the making of financial contributions than would otherwise be the case in a long marriage.\u201d[95] 220 i take into account the short duration of the parties\u2019 marriage. section 75(2)(m) \u2014 if either party is cohabiting with another person\u2013the financial circumstances relating to the cohabitation 221 there is no evidence as to whether or not either party has re-partnered. section 75(2)(n) \u2014 the terms of any order made or proposed to be made under section 79 in relation to the property of the parties 222 i note with respect to this factor the full court\u2019s remarks in marsh & marsh [2014] famcafc 24 in allowing the appeal before them that: \u201c[t]here is nothing in any of the ss 79(4)(d) to (g), or elsewhere in s 79 which requires a judge to calculate in dollar terms the differential achieved between the parties in the judge has apportioned assessment of contribution in percentage terms. nevertheless, it is a matter of common practice developed by judges exercising discretion under s 79 of the act, to carry out such an exercise, at least at the time matters relevant to s 79(4)(e) are considered. section 75(2)(n), on one level at least, invites such an exercise. had the federal magistrate carried out such an exercise, in this case, he may have reached a different determination as to the amount of adjustment which was required under s 75(2).\u201d[96] 223 i undertake the exercise spoken of by their honours at paragraphs 233 \u2013 242 of these reasons upon considering whether the assessments, adjustments, and effect of the ultimate order made are just and equitable. 224 the parties have agreed to equally divide their superannuation entitlements. this will result in a splitting order of $30,415.50 to the wife pursuant to s 90xt of the act. 225 with respect to non-superannuation assets, i have assessed the wife\u2019s contributions as 7%. the practical result of this is that the husband retains assets with a value of $579,201.74, and the wife retains assets with a value of $43,595.83. 226 looking at the asset pool as a whole, the wife will receive assets including superannuation of $74,011.33, and the husband $609,617.24. 227 i note here that the above settlement calculations, based only on the assessment of contributions, plainly reveal a remaining and significant capital disparity. 228 further, the husband\u2019s assets are quality assets, and produce income for the husband by way of rent. the husband is also able to rent out a sign on his land, for which he can receive $300.00 per annum. section 75(2)(o) \u2014 any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account 229 the wife is more financially vulnerable than the husband. she relies solely on centrelink allowances, and holds no significant property aside from a motor vehicle.[97] 230 the husband is in a strong position, in which his income-producing and appreciating assets will build upon his wealth as time progresses. his strong and stable income best places him to deal with the debt associated with these assets. conclusion in relation to 75(2) factors 231 i conclude that there should be an adjustment to the wife under s 75(2) of 6.5%. 232 i make this conclusion with particular reference to the following factors: (a) the significant income and capital disparity between the husband and the wife, (b) their relative ages, (c) the wife\u2019s current unemployment alongside factors that make it more difficult for her to secure a strong and stable income, including her absence from the workforce for many years, her lack of training, and limited english, (d) the wife\u2019s reliance upon centrelink benefits, (e) the parties superannuation holdings, and the husband\u2019s greater ability to increase his superannuation holding, (f) the husband\u2019s retention of income-producing and appreciating assets, and (g) the fact that the relationship subsisted for 6 years, with the wife spending part of that period outside of australia. the significant income and capital disparity between the husband and the wife, (b) their relative ages, (c) the wife\u2019s current unemployment alongside factors that make it more difficult for her to secure a strong and stable income, including her absence from the workforce for many years, her lack of training, and limited english, (d) the wife\u2019s reliance upon centrelink benefits, (e) the parties superannuation holdings, and the husband\u2019s greater ability to increase his superannuation holding, (f) the husband\u2019s retention of income-producing and appreciating assets, and (g) the fact that the relationship subsisted for 6 years, with the wife spending part of that period outside of australia. the overall effect of the order 233 my assessment of the parties\u2019 contributions, and the s 75(2) factors, leads me to conclude that the parties\u2019 non-superannuation assets should be divided on an 86.5 /13.5% basis in favour of the husband. 234 the non-superannuation asset pool has a net value of $622,797.57. 235 the husband will retain assets valued at a total of $538,719.90. 236 the wife\u2019s entitlement of the non-superannuation assets amounts to a sum of $84,077.67. the wife will retain her car valued at $3,525, meaning that $80,552.67 is payable by the husband to her to account for the gap. 237 the wife will receive a further $2,640.00, being the husband\u2019s share of the valuation fees as agreed. 238 this results in the husband making payment to the wife in the amount of $83,192.67 239 the wife will also receive a split of superannuation by agreement in the amount of $30,415.50. 240 the total net pool including superannuation amounts to $683,628.57. including superannuation the wife will receive 16.75% of the total pool. 241 finally, i have included a provision in the order to allow the wife to collect her belongings from the c road property. there was little evidence regarding the need for such an order, but the wife sought an order with those terms.[98] since the husband did not contradict the wife\u2019s evidence in this respect, i will make a restrictive order allowing the wife to collect her personal belongings. is the order just and equitable? 242 i am satisfied that, given the short period of marriage, the parties\u2019 contributions throughout the marriage and my assessment thereof, and the consideration of the factors under s 75(2), ordering an adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests as set out above is just and equitable. dated: 28 october 2021 [1] affidavit of mr yancey, affirmed and filed 3 may 2021, [102]-[103].[2] affidavit of ns ngueng,

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 19 july 2023 federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2) gamber & landy [2023] fedcfamc2f 743 orders the court orders that: the court notes that: reasons for judgment judge morley: in mid-january 2021, with still no response from either icls, out of total frustration that this was not going to be complied with, i informed the centre that it appeared that [ms landy] was not going to comply so our spot should be given to someone else. you won't get anything from the asset split and you will not see the kids. we will be supporting [ms landy] and we will give her as much money as she needs to fight you. after our final separation in 2015, i realised i had a problem with alcohol and how it made be behave. i attended counselling at [bb centre] with counsellor [mr cc] for six sessions between 17 september 2015 and 4 december 2015. there are still psychosocial issues that [mr gamber] faces (currently now more related to custody of his children). however, his condition is stable and has been since late last year. since [ms landy] has already convinced the children that i'm a crazy cunt, what's the point in stopping now? and annexes a copy of the said email to the affidavit. she says that on 5 january 2023, the father sent a phone text message in words to the effect of: she says that on 5 january 2023, the father sent a phone text message in words to the effect of: morning, [x] and [y]. just thinking of you on this anniversary. love you lots xoxo. and another quote: it was eight years this morning my life went from a misery to really happy. and also: doesn't matter. just when i stopped being abused and started to feel happy like i once was. 5 january, of course, is the prime date given for the separation of the parties. stated that she stopped speaking with her father after a telephone call in 2020 when he told them that he was hurt and they were not worth talking to because they were so happy living with a woman who had ruined their lives, namely, their mother. [y] stated that she felt sad and angry toward her father for making that comment about her mother. she became quite distressed as she talked about her father's attitude. she said that she felt hurt at the time as she had been trying to be happy for so long, and as her father he should be wanting the best for her. she said that she does not want to be around someone who made her feel bad for the way she felt. [x] stated that she blamed herself for her parents' separation at one time. reported that she has some good memories of being with her father, that he was a fun dad who tried to make time for them. she said, \"he was a good dad but not a good person\". she said that he was not violent, and although he used physical discipline when they were young, it was not excessive. however, she said that she understands he has been violent in other contexts. she then referred to him destroying their kitchen with a sledgehammer because he was angry. she said she has not seen her father since she was in year 5 \"and her life has been easier not seeing him\". she said that her father continuously made snide remarks about her mother which made her feel uncomfortable. she also asserted that the rules changed from house to house. she finds it easier to be in one house where there is only one set of rules. stated she currently does not know where her father is and she is not interested in having contact with him. [x] said she cannot see any future or possibility of repairing her relationship with her father. she said that she can't look passed what he has done, namely, destroy the kitchen, blaming everything on their mother, making snide remarks and fighting with her uncle. she stated her mother is a good mother and that she is lucky to have such a good parent. she referred to her mother helping her develop better organisational skills. she nominated her mother as friend and friends as her go-to people and people who give her the best hugs. she said she is currently in a good space, did not want anything to jeopardise that. she said she no longer sees a counsellor and is not on any medication. she would like to communicate the message to the court that she currently does not want to see her father unless she chooses to. she stated she does not expect anything from her father, such as presents. she said that at some time in the future she may resume a relationship with her father but she would like to determine when that time might be. she stated that she does not see that there would be any obstacles to her seeing her father if that is what she chooses. during the interview her presentation was as flat in her effect, short and impatient, not wishing to be interviewed. she mumbled at various points through the interview and said she did not want to be there. [y] said she used to live with her father on a week about basis, that her father was fun to be around, but since he has done what he has done, he has been a changed person. [y] stated she did not think her father was all that able to look after them. stated that she had some unpleasant interactions with her father on the telephone. she said that he has told her and [x] that he did not love them because they saw and spoke with their paternal family and not with him. [y] stated that her father has been gaslighting on the phone. [y] stated that she stopped talking to her father at the time but then resumed several months later. said that her father has been telling her that his situation is not his fault, and that it is practically her mother's fault. she stated that she believes her father is lying to her and defends himself trying to convince her that he is a good guy. [y] stated that she is not afraid of either parent. [y] seemed ambivalent about her wishes to see her father. she said that there are times when she thinks she would like to see him every fortnight, but then there are times when she thinks she would like to choose when she sees him. she said she would prefer to spend time with her father alone because her mother and [x] make things worse, although she was unable to articulate in what way that was the case. she said she would probably feel annoyed if she did not get to see her father. the children expressed different views about spending time with their father. [x] indicated she does not currently want her living arrangements to change. she indicated she would like to pause contact with the father electronically and in person, in the knowledge that she could reconnect with him if and when she was ready. her position is not atypical of children who move into their adolescent years and find that they can no longer traverse the delicate terrain of moving between two warring parents, and that it is much more manageable for them to live in the care of one parent and park the relationship with the other to some future date. [y] seemed to be more ambivalent in respect of her views to have a relationship with her father. she appears to have felt disappointed with their father when there have been interruptions in their contact, and sought to resume communication after the interruption in 2020. she indicated she would like to have contact with him electronically and face to face, perhaps fortnightly. she also indicated that she believes she could manage to do that individually, even though her sister may think she should also be present. the children at the time of their interviews were 14 years and 11 years of age, and that given their ages, some weight needs to be accorded to their views. in particular displayed considerable maturity and insight in her disclosures in respect of her feelings and thoughts. in the case of [y], her living arrangements will need to juxtapose her views alongside safety concerns. gamber] seems to have minimised the seriousness of his actions in his conversations with the children, and possibly has limited insight into how his behaviour extrapolates to parenting relationships. if the children reach the point where they wish to delve further into what has occurred with their father - and there she is referring to the [mid] 2019 criminal matter - that may best be processed in a therapeutic environment. the children seem to have formed the belief that their father has been unreliable and undermining of their mother, and they have become progressively more disgruntled with the way he has interacted with them and his lack of insight into the impact of his behaviour, and some of his choices, such as suspending telephone contact and not following through on visits at the contact centre, would have contributed to the children feeling their father has abandoned them. it also provides the court with little material with which to move forward in making orders that are child-focused and ensure the children's safety. the capacity of the father to self-regulate seems to have been compromised when he has been under the influence of alcohol. june 2019 certainly seems to bear that out. the court would need to have the assurance that if either of the children was to spend time with their father, he would need to provide evidence that he has not been consuming alcohol. ...that [x] live with her mother and spend time with her father in accordance with her wishes. ...that [y] spend time with her father initially supervised, and that progress to unsupervised time, contingent on the feedback from the contact supervision service. if the time between [y] and the father was to progress to unsupervised time, it would be recommended it be no longer than alternate weekends. if the court considers that the father's alcohol use poses a risk to the children, orders may need to be put in place in relation to his consumption of alcohol if either child is in his care. ...that the parties do not discuss their adult issues in the presence of the children or expose them to conversations which denigrate the other or significant others. a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions, and intuition. associate: dated: 3 may 2023 dated: 3 may 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "920.txt", "size": 10188, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 10236, "document_id": "920"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "920_chunk_0"}}

assessment of contributions holistically and by analysing the nature, form, characteristics and origin of the property currently comprising that to which s 79 applied, and, in turn, analysing the nature, form and extent of the contributions (of all types) contemplated by s 79. this is the position, the defendant having called no evidence it is a matter of common sense that you should accept the plaintiff's evidence with respect to the facts as being accurate. the fact that the defendant hegedus has not gone into the box and offered any explanation leaves you in this position, that you can accept the facts given by the plaintiff as proved, but the question then is whether you should find negligence against him as a matter of inference to be drawn from those facts, and that is the question for you, whether you think from the proved facts an inference of negligence ought to be drawn. if you think so, the plaintiff is entitled to your verdict. if, on the other hand, you think no such inference can be drawn then the verdict must go against the plaintiff and in favour of the defendant.[3] the usual way in which defective disclosure is taken into account is either by adding a sum to the pool, reflective of an estimate of the value of undisclosed property ..., or under s 75(2)(o) of the act. ... finally, and of great significance, is the husband\u2019s non-disclosure of his financial position. it is substantial. it would appear that the husband\u2019s business dealings in china involve sums of money greatly in excess of the assets presently in australia. he appears to have under his control significantly large (in terms of the assets in australia) sums of cash which he lends out for profit. at least until late 2012 he carried on a substantial and significant business in australia under the name bao qing ding with a gross income of hundreds of thousands of dollars a year. where there has been deliberate non-disclosure the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. it may well be appropriate to err on the side of generosity. black & kellner [1992] famca 2, (1992) flc 92-287, weir and weir [1992]

[the mother] raised concerns about the children's emotional well-being in the father's care due to alleged exposure to denigration of her, paternal aggression and anger, and involvement in the parental dispute. [the mother] believes both children need counselling though [the father] has not provided his consent. she said that [w] bites her nails, wet her bed for 4 months after her father repartnered, and still wets her bed occasionally. she believes [w] feels pressured and fears saying something wrong or upsetting her parents. she said [z] is sensitive and emotional and feels unloved if his father becomes angry or ignores him. ... [the father] said he finds the mother's poor punctuality frustrating, but the children did not seem to be perturbed about arriving at school late and the children's overall attendance did not seem to be of concern. the father did acknowledge that the pandemic has been difficult for the mother as the maternal grandmother is unwell and the mother has been unable to return to [country d] to see her, family, or friends. ... whilst the parents alleged denigration and influence by the other parent, these were not found to be significant issues during the current evaluation. however, it is important that the father allows the mother to spend time with the children as she wishes, without criticism, intimidation, or pressure. ... the father presented with positive impression management regarding his abilities as a parent, the children\u2019s level of functioning, the strength of the children ' s relationships with his partner and her children , and how well the children have adjusted to the blending of families and the separation. this may reflect a lack of insight by the father or conscious positive distortion. regardless, the father has dismissed the children\u2019s struggle to adjust to the changes in their lives and lack of stability and consistency in his care, thus has not responded to their need for additional care, consideration, and support. he seems to lack an understanding of attachment processes and the children's need for a stable base, seeming more concerned about equal time, the mother\u2019s punctuality, and the children's unreturned shoes. the mother is more emotionally attuned and responsive to the children's needs. she is aware that [w] is anxious about saying something wrong and upsetting her parents, and that [z] is sensitive to his father's anger, which was apparent during this evaluation but not recognised by the father. [z], in particular, is more closely bonded to his mother. both children prefer greater time with their mother than their father, though [w] was hesitant in saying so. both parents appear to be devoted to the children and capable of meeting their basic and developmental needs. it is important that the children\u2019s secure attachment to their mother is protected and nurtured to ensure the best possible developmental outcomes, but also that the father\u2019s relationship with the children is given adequate opportunity to develop , strengthen, and grow. the family report ... the father prioritised time with the children by selling [the [suburb o]] and purchased his current five-bedroom home in [[suburb r]], 10 km from the children's primary school. settlement was on 4 august 2021. the father is now able to offer the children stable accommodation after a period of instability. ... during the [first] report evaluation, [the mother] expressed concerns about the father facilitating communication with the children whilst in his care and he indicated that he encourages contact, but the children do not want to communicate with the mother. both parents believe that the other refuses to facilitate communication at the request of the children and the father believes that the mother shuts their communication down, though the parents' concerns were not supported by the children. the father likely distrusts the mother as she previously blocked his calls on her phone as she was feeling harassed. [the mother] is also of the view that the children are too scared to ask the father if they can speak to the mother, yet the father will contact the children incessantly whilst in her care and disrupt her time with the children. she referred to [w] missing 23 calls from the father recently when out and unavailable. [the mother] would like communication to occur at fixed times so that the children are able to contact each parent but are not made to feel harassed, intimidated, or distressed. ... [the mother] continues to feel intimidated, denigrated, controlled, monitored, and attacked by the father about minor issues, such as her punctuality and attendance. [the father] acknowledged that he finds the mother's poor punctuality frustrating. her disorganisation and tardiness also impacted the family report assessments, such that others had to change their plans at short notice to accommodate the mother's lack of planning. whilst the father acknowledged her lateness may be driven by culture, he believes it is disrespectful and inconsiderate of others who are negatively impacted. he said the children's sports teams are let down when the children are late, and the children are made to feel embarrassed or uncomfortable. he said, \"it's not that hard to turn up on time\". [the mother] said the father has repeatedly breached the full exclusion ivo though she has notified police on one occasion when he came within 5 m of her at [sports] training. he said he lifted his head and was 3 m from her, he froze and stared at her. he was charged with the breach and received a six-month community corrections order without conviction. she claimed that he also said \"don't be pathetic\" when she videoed him at after-school care and shouted at her when she was handing over [s school] bag with uniform, \"if i don't have what i asked you for, [the children] will not come to school on monday. do you understand?\" ... [the mother] stated that the father continually makes her feel intimidated by attending the children's activities, training, and after school care during her time with the children. she said she cannot enjoy her time with the children, and the children are exposed to the tension created. she also claimed that he approaches her car when she is inside, opens the car doors and boot, and places items inside, causing her significant distress. he believed he was doing the right thing by chaperoning the children to the car and carrying their items, particularly when it is cold and raining, but said \"she jumps up and down\" about him approaching the vehicle. ... the father responded well to being told that his presence increases the mother's anxiety, whether justified or not, and therefore the tension to which the children are exposed, thus minimising unnecessary contact and communication is of benefit to the children. the father said he would give her space to sit with the team supporters at [sports] matches during the week in which the children are in her care and discontinue approaching her car. he said he wants the mother to be happy as he believes the children will also benefit from that. [the mother] previously raised concerns about the children's emotional well-being in the father's care due to exposure paternal aggression anger and aggression, and the father denigrating her in their presence, but seemed more concerned about the children's exposure to tension and conflict between the parents on this occasion. whilst she said the father does not have a strong emotional connection with the children, she acknowledged the children have fun with the father. the father acknowledged that the pandemic was difficult for the mother as the maternal grandmother has been unwell and the mother was unable to return to [country d] to see her, but she has returned to [country d] twice this year. the father is very supportive of the mother being able to travel to [country d] once or twice annually and is open to travel outside of the school holidays whilst the children are young. however, he does not want a repeat of the last school holidays whereby the children spent four weeks away from him though they did not travel overseas. he said the entire holiday period was allocated to the mother and the mother tested positive for covid and kept the children with her. the father was disappointed that the mother had not allowed him to collect the children when they tested negative, though he had arranged for the mother to take the children when he tested positive in january. he said the four-week period in which the children did not see him was distressing for the children and not child focused. ... [the mother] presented as na\u00efve, anxious, and lacking in self-esteem and confidence. although child focused and emotionally attuned to the children, her thought patterns were scattered and tangential, as her behaviour was disorganised. she was late and had not arranged a supervisor for the children during her interview, though i advised [her] to do so in advance. the day had to be reorganised to accommodate the mother's lack of planning. ... [the mother] is concerned that [w] is overly considerate, lacks assertiveness, and is being triangulated in the parental dispute by her father, causing her to feel nervous, overwhelmed, and pressured. [the mother] claims that the father lets [w] read all the messages on the parenting app and communicates through [w] when he does not get what he wants from the mother. [the mother] believes [w] does not want to upset her parents and is always worried about each parent being happy. [the mother] raised concerns regarding parent-child communication when the child is in the other parent's care. she is concerned that whilst in their father's care, the children are not given privacy when they communicate with her, they fear asking to call her, and the father refuses to facilitate calls. she claimed he is the background during video calls as the children will look backwards. she reported that the children expressed that they miss her when with the father, but [z] will say \"i'll deal with it\" and no longer calls or speaks during video calls. [the mother] claimed that [z] stopped calling following an incident in which the father prevented him from contacting the mother when crying and pleading to speak to her. [the mother wants] scheduled phone calls so that the children are not burdened with having to ask to call the other parent and to avoid the father calling the children incessantly and disregarding that they may be busy. [w] and the mother indicated that [w] received 23 missed calls from her father recently. ... [the mother] is concerned about the children's emotional well-being in the father's care and that the father has not provided consent for the children to receive counselling. although she previously raised concerns regarding the father denigrating her in the children's presence and exposing them to aggression and anger, this seemed to be less of a concern during the current evaluation. ... [the father] is a 45-year-old male who initially presented as defensive, dominant, and unwilling to show vulnerability, but this changed significantly as the interview progressed. he appeared far more flexible, open to discussing different viewpoints, and expressed willingness to adapt his own behaviour to reduce the mother's distress and therefore the tension to which the children are exposed. this seemed to be a considerable shift since the previous evaluation. ... [the father] said he was devastated by the assessor's recommendation of a 9:5 arrangement in the previous report though it was not adopted. the assessor explained that his living arrangements were unstable, the children were not comfortable living with his partner and children, and the children have closer emotional connection to the mother. ... [w] indicated that she likes the current time arrangements as each week goes quickly and she has a lot of fun. however, she recently spent an extended period with her mother during the school holidays and missed her father. [w] wants the current time arrangements to remain in place and thought they may have been in place for one or two years. she believes that these arrangements are fair, and she did not like it when she saw her father every second weekend. [w] recalled that there were problems when changeover occurred at [sport] as her parents \"don't like each other\". she said that they \"look at each other like they don't like each other\" which makes her feel sad. she said that changeover mostly occurs at school now. [w] said that her parents sit on opposite sides of the sports court during [[z]'s] matches and \"it's weird\" as her mother sits with the other team. if she goes over to see her father, her mother will say come back. she is aware that her mother is uncomfortable at these games with the father present. [w] said that her mother does not say anything bad about her father, and her father rarely says good or bad things about her mother. however, her father asked why her mother \"can't just see [his] messages on [the our family wizard app]? he added, \"mum makes everything harder\". [w] was asked if she ever felt worried, scared, or uncomfortable with either parent. she said that her mother always allows her to call her father and says that they can call him whenever they want but her father will not stop calling her ipad. [w] said, \"if i have to go, i say i will call him back\", but if she goes out, she returns to \"so many missed messages\" from her father. [w] said, \"i think he thinks i'm going as i don't want to speak to him, but i truly have to go\". [w] said that her father will call her even when he knows that she is already rushing to get ready and will become \"really angry\" when her mother is late. [w] said that her father will say, that \"mummy grew up in [country], but mummy needs to understand that this is australia and there are different rules\". [w] said that they sometimes wear shorts in winter, but \"get used to it\". however, her father will say, \"mummy needs to understand it's not [country], it's winter, and it's not hot every day\". [w] stated that she has been to [country d] five or six times and stays with her maternal grandmother and sees her aunt and cousins. she said her father does not like [country d] as he says it is \"sticky, humid, and dirty\", and that \"people live in the same houses and sleep in the same bed\". [w] indicated that she has her own room at both her parents' houses, sleeps in her own bed, and likes going to [country d]. ... [w] said that she enjoys riding a bike, jumping on the trampoline, and baking with her father. the best thing about her father is that he is funny and makes jokes about everything. the worst thing about her father is the pressure he places on her to call him when at her mother's house. she believes that he thinks that the mother is stopping her from calling him when this is not the case. [w] said that a good memory of time with her father is when they went to the swimming pool and played [a game] whereby, she falls into the pool, and he catches her. however, she said that [z] will blame her when he does something wrong, and her father will yell and smack her. she said she was last smacked by her father two weeks ago and a week before that, but [z] is smacked less. she said her mother used to smack her but does not anymore. [w] said she loves shopping and watching movies with her mother. the best thing about her mother is that she is funny and makes puns with the [language]. the worst thing about her mother is that her mother blames her when [z] does something wrong. if she is in trouble, her mother will yell but then tries to teach her a lesson. she said her father yells more and when he is stressed, he also swears. [w] volunteered that her mother works a lot, including at home, and she would prefer that her mother worked less, so that she attends after school care two days a week rather than monday to thursday when in her mother's care. she said that her father is more active and available to her. ... ... [z] indicated that his father yells a lot and that this makes him scared. ... [z] said that he currently plays [sports]. he said his parents take him to [sports] separately, but his father always attends whereas his mother only attends when he is staying at her house. he likes it best when they are both present. in terms of time arrangements, he said that week about arrangements are pretty good. he does not want arrangements to change as they are \"even\", have been in place for a long time, and he missed his father when he only saw him every second weekend. he is aware that his father wants the same amount of time as his mother and believes his mother wants what is fair. ... [z] said his mother does not talk about his father, but he does not think that she likes him. he said his father does not talk about his mother much as he does not like her. he said they will walk away from each other when they come into contact, and this makes him feel sad. [z] said that he enjoys doing everything with his mother, but especially hugging, watching movies together, and being tickled by his mother. the best thing about his mum is \"everything\" and the worst thing is when she gets angry with him as she yells, but \"not so much... it's a bit scary, but dad is scarier and yells more often coz i'm a bit naughty\". [z] smiled and said that his mother smacks him a lot, but his father will yell and tell him not to misbehave again. [z] said that he enjoys hanging around together, telling jokes, and sharing movie nights with his father. the best thing about his father is when he sleeps with him about twice per week, though he never sleeps with his mother. the worst thing about his father is that he yells a lot and becomes scary. ... after the parents separated, the mother unilaterally decided that the father needed to live within 15 km of the school to support equal time arrangements, but the children should otherwise spend four nights per fortnight with him. time arrangements varied thereafter according to the father's proximity to the school and remote learning during lockdown. as a measure of his devotion to the children, the father sold the farm to relocate closer to the school and satisfy the mother's condition for equal time arrangements. the children felt unsettled by the father's changing living arrangements and having to co reside with his new partner and children, but the father has since bought a large home within 10 km of the children's primary school, and his partner and children live separately. whilst the mother is more emotionally attuned to the children and the children both expressed having a closer connection with her, the father is more available to the children and more capable of supporting the children's engagement in education and extracurricular activities, and ensuring they attend on time. orders for equal time arrangements on a week about basis were made on 11 march 2021. no major concerns have been raised regarding the amount of time the children spend with each parent since, and the father's living arrangements have stabilised, thus it is not in the best interests of the children to vary these arrangements. the children are also seeking that these arrangements remain in place. it is also recommended that equal time arrangements continue throughout the school holidays with flexibility to reschedule time arrangements for extended holidays with the children, so that the mother is able to return to [country] and the children are not subjected to another extended block of time away from a parent unnecessarily. there has been a significant change in the parents' presentation between assessments. the father was rigid, defensive, and domineering during the previous evaluation, and his animosity and resentment towards the mother and determination to establish a blended family clouded his ability to remain child focused and respond appropriately to the children's needs. on this occasion, he presented as the more flexible parent, more willing to compromise and adapt his behaviour to reduce the mother's anxiety and therefore the tension to which the children are exposed. the father shifted his focus from equal time to being involved in all aspects of the children's lives but did not adequately consider the impact of his increased presence on the mother's anxiety levels, or that she would feel intimidated or harassed as a result. on the other hand, the mother has become increasingly inflexible as her anxiety increased. she has made several decisions without consulting the father, such as relocating to the catchment area for the school she prefers. such behaviour is not conducive to establishing positive communication and an effective co-parenting relationship in which both parents' views are valued and considered. a parallel parenting approach is therefore recommended, whereby each parent is responsible for their own time with the children without the other parent's interference, so that the children's exposure to tension between the parents, maternal control, and parental distress is minimised. communication should only relate to health, education, extracurricular activities, and religious and logistical matters in relation to the children with the use of a parenting app. it will be necessary for the father to discontinue attending the children's activities during the mother's time when the mother is present, other than the children's weekend sports matches, to minimise the children's exposure to tension, conflict, and maternal distress. both parents are capable of making long-term decisions in the best interests of the children, thus parental responsibility should be equally shared. however, engagement with a parenting coordinator is recommended once final orders are made to avoid returning to court, and for support when make long-term decisions, such as choosing a high school for the children next year. ... whilst the children's views were not given significant weight due to the children's age and maturity, desire to please both parents, and limited understanding of the dispute and the long-term implications of their proposals, the recommended time arrangements align with their preferences. both children present with anxiety-related issues in the context of their parents' separation and would benefit from engaging with a psychologist. the children have been observed to be closely bonded to both parents and both parents appear to be devoted to the children and capable of meeting their basic and developmental needs. it is important that the mother's close attachment to the children is protected and nurtured, but also that the father is given adequate opportunity to develop and strengthen his connection with the children, and this should be reflected in time arrangements. ... recommendations in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the following recommendations are respectfully made: the parents have equal shared parental responsibility for the children. the children spend equal time with each parent on a week about basis with changeover commencement of school on fridays (or 9 am on non-school days), continuing during school holidays, with special dates shared. there is flexibility to reschedule time arrangements by mutual agreement in writing to allow for extended holidays. the mother can travel to [country d] with the children for a period of up to 3 weeks, up to twice annually. ... video or telephone communication is scheduled at a mutually agreed time twice per week between the children and parent with whom the children are not spending time, for example, sundays and wednesdays from 6:30 pm until 7 pm. the children are given privacy to speak with the other parent during such times. video or telephone communication between the children and other parent is facilitated when reasonably requested by the children. the children are given privacy to speak with the other parent during such times. the parents are at liberty to attend the children's school/extracurricular activities, but the father does not attend extracurricular lessons, training, or after school care during the weeks in which the children are in the mother's care unless the mother provides written consent or confirms that she is unable to attend. if the mother is due to collect the children, the father vacates the area at least 10 minutes prior. when attending the children's weekend games/matches, it is assumed that the parent with whom the children are spending time will sit with the team's supporters and the other parent will sit at a reasonable distance to minimise tension between the parents. the parents discontinue yelling at and using physical discipline with the children. the children are referred to a psychologist to address underlying anxiety that may be causing nocturnal enuresis in [w] and [z] to bottle his feelings, emotions, and experience of bullying. they may be eligible for a mental health care plan via their gp. ... the mother continues to engage in therapy to address her heightened symptoms of anxiety. the father facilitates the children's attendance at [af club] during his week should the children wish to engage, and at [language] classes online, should they resume. [emphasis added] mr trim: in your family report interviews with, for example, [w], you recall she was complaining that her mother works too much? ms p: yes. mr trim: well, having \u2013 having regard to that, would you \u2013 and would you recommend that the mother be restrained by injunction from working at a place like this on a weekend, for example, when the children are meant to be with her, if \u2013 if money is not the issue? ms p: yes. mr trim: the need for money is not the issue? ms p: i certainly don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the children\u2019s best interests because of \u2013 that did come across clearly that they already \u2013 and this certainly wasn\u2019t mentioned to me, and i did ask about... work. but [w] in particular made it clear ... that she felt her mother ... worked too much. she also ... didn\u2019t want to be attending after school care as frequently as she was. so this is in addition to this. so she was already finding that too much, so i don\u2019t think it\u2019s in the best interests of the children. obviously, ... if it is proceeding, then it is important that they have adequate care if she\u2019s working, but ... i can imagine that [w] ... would prefer that her mother does not work. the parties\u2019 cases summary of father\u2019s case and witnesses 1a. save for the issue of secondary school, the parents have equal shared parental responsibility for the children. that from 1 july 2023 the father have sole parental responsibility for the children in relation to the high school they attend and for the purpose of this: the father shall contact the mother in writing and provide his views about the high school(s) he nominates, the mother and father shall make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision about which high school the children will attend, and if no agreement is reached between the parents by 1 july 2023, the father make the final decision and inform the mother in writing of it. that the children attend [q school or [s school] for their secondary schooling, at the parties\u2019 joint equal expense, or such other school or schools chosen by the father. that the father pay $100,000 into a trust account as security for payment of any school fees and compulsory incidental expenses. that the children live with the parties on a week-about basis (save for unless otherwise agreed between the parties in writing \u2013 including via sms / email), with changeover to occur at the conclusion of school or 3:15pm on fridays. that in 2022 the children shall be with the father for the whole of the term 3 school holidays. that the children\u2019s time with the mother be suspended: from 4pm on christmas eve until 4pm on christmas day in 2022, and each alternate year, and from 4pm on christmas day until 4pm on boxing day in 2023, and each alternate year. 8. the children\u2019s time with the father be suspended: from 4pm on christmas day until 4pm on boxing day in 2022, and each alternate year, and from 4pm on christmas eve until 4pm on christmas day in 2023, and each alternate year. that unless otherwise agreed in writing, changeover take place at the children\u2019s school, or mcdonalds in [suburb b] if the children are not then attending school. that the parties shall facilitate the children try to speak with their other parent each sunday and thursday between 6:30pm and 7pm, and as reasonably requested or facilitated by the children \u2013 and with the children to be afforded reasonable privacy during these calls. that the father retain the passport for [z] and the mother retain the passport for [w], and these passports be provided to the parent requiring them at least 48 hours before a scheduled international holiday, and be returned to where they shall be stored within 48 hours of arrival back in australia. that the parties be restrained by injunction from working shifts on weekends the children are in their care. that if either parent cannot get the children to school or their scheduled activities on time they shall forthwith notify the other parent and request their assistance to facilitate the children get where they need to be in a timely manner. ... the children say to me when they are with me \"i love living here and we want to stay with you all the time because we have fun and do not have to go to work with mummy all the time.\" they crave the normal routine which only i provide them - and [the mother] does not. she just fails to provide routine, be it [attending] school on time, attending their sporting commitments (training and games) failing to turn up, and often late. i accept that the children may say this to simply to show their love to me and to appease me. i have no doubt that they probably say the same thing to [the mother] but whilst they say these things, it is still being said with truthfulness. ... the children are not unwell. they just didn't get to go to their training. i would have been more than happy to take them. [the mother] just did not want to take them, and she didn't make any arrangements for them to attend. it appears that [the mother] is simply not child focussed. another example of not being child focussed is in the family report when [the mother] took two telephone calls whilst being observed with the children. from my experience, [the mother] is always on her phone whilst at training or at games and whilst we were together, and at every pick up/change over she always prioritised her work, including telephone calls and other nuisances, over the children. ... [the mother] is now declining to take the children to their games. this has happened twice this season, and countless times [the mother] arrives late to saturday morning games \u2013 [i] am always there on time, and there to quickly usher [w] into the stadium and comfort her. [the mother] has zero interest in the kids sporting interests, and zero regard for their commitment to teams. she disrespects the children and teams this way. the children hate it, and they love me being there and they can only ever always rely on me to be there for them. i have to tell them which court they are on and rush to get them there as the match has already started. sometimes when [z] gets on the court, he gets confused as to which way their team is going and always looks over to me for help and i quickly gesture which way. the children deserve to warm-up, be part of the team and not be looked down upon by their peers when they are late. [i] always prepare water bottles and snacks for the children as [the mother] does not always bring anything for them. ... i don't say i don't like [country d]. i say is it hot yes?? [in the original]. the children also say they don't like [country d] but deep down they do enjoy going - but definitely not the chaotic schedule driving thousands of kms from place to place and getting sick. they do not like the excessive heat or busy schedule and getting sick from exhaustion. ... as [the mother] cannot look after the children, cannot get them to school and extra-curricular activities on time, i believe that the children should live with more predominately with me to enable [the mother] to concentrate on her businesses/work life. this is her priority as she, continually demonstrates with her actions, week in week out and especially since and during the family report session with [[ms p]]. i do not believe it fair on the children to be stuck up in a room for hours on end whilst [the mother] works at a restaurant or to spend weekends/late weeknights driving around to all hours picking up/dropping off supplies for [the mother\u2019s] business. the children should be having a routine, going to bed at a reasonable hour and getting to places on time, especially once they start to reach their teenage years and commence at high school. [the mother\u2019s] current work life does not support their developmental needs or their best interests. ... i am very worried that [the mother] wants to damage the children's relationship with me by telling them negative things about me and cutting me out of decisions. ms o\u2019connell: you do. okay. now, you also said basically in the same affidavit you say that you\u2019re the better parent, therefore the children should live more with you, that\u2019s what you put in your affidavit. okay? the father: yes. ... ms o\u2019connell: you say at paragraph 97, which is right at the end of your affidavit: as [the mother] cannot look after the children, cannot get them to school and extracurricular activities on time, i believe that the children should live with more predominantly with me to enable [the mother] to concentrate on her business/work life. this is her priority, as she continually demonstrates with her actions. okay? the father: absolutely. yes. yes. ... the father: the children have a strong emotional connection to their mother and, of course, i want them to maintain and grow that emotional connection with their mother, as well as with myself. ... ms o\u2019connell: all right. now, just going back to these reports, and [ms p] in the section 11f report said that in her opinion the mother was lacking in self-esteem. do you agree that the mother lacks in self-esteem? the father: yes. ms o\u2019connell: yes. and you\u2019ve agreed, also, that you\u2019ve said to her when she forgot a pair of runners for one of the kids that she was pathetic and disgusting, that\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it? the father: no. it\u2019s \u2013 i said those words. i\u2019m referring to the act of forgetting is pathetic and disgusting. i\u2019m not saying [the mother] is disgusting. i\u2019m saying the act of forgetting an item which is critical for our daughter\u2019s [sports] game is pathetic and disgusting. ms o\u2019connell: yes? the father: that is what is absolutely truth. ms o\u2019connell: you didn\u2019t say to her, \u201ci\u2019m not saying this about you. i\u2019m saying this about an act that it is pathetic and disgusting\u201d? the father: sorry, can you repeat \u2013 rephrase? ms o\u2019connell: all right. you said to the mother, \u201cyou\u2019re pathetic and disgusting\u201d, didn\u2019t you? the father: yes - - - ms o\u2019connell: thanks? the father: - - - in reference to her forgetting the item. ms o\u2019connell: yes? the father: a very simple item. ms o\u2019connell: yes. and knowing that she is a person with low self-esteem, you would imagine that would have a significant impact on her, wouldn\u2019t you? the father: no. ms o\u2019connell: no? the father: i don\u2019t think that would impact her at all. ms o\u2019connell: okay. right? the father: because i don\u2019t think she believes \u2013 doesn\u2019t take on board anything that i say... ... his honour: you remember the occasion [of the child\u2019s eye injury when the mother informed the father]? the father: i do remember the occasion, absolutely, yes. it\u2019s ingrained in my brain the day my daughter sustained a burn on her eye. his honour: and your response was, \u201ci\u2019m not a doctor\u201d and \u201ci was at work\u201d, yes, to me now. yes. yes, ms o\u2019connell. ms o\u2019connell: well, what the mother says that you said was, \u201cwhy are you contacting me? i\u2019m not a doctor\u201d, that that was the response she got from you, is that correct? the father: i don\u2019t recall the exact words that i said, ms o\u2019connell. ms o\u2019connell: do you recall if it was words to that effect, that, \u201cwhy are you contacting me\u201d, basically, \u201ci can\u2019t do anything. i\u2019m not a doctor\u201d? the father: possibly words to that effect. i would be calling a hospital if it happened on my clock and arranging medical treatment urgently, but i wouldn\u2019t be holding a baby over a boiling pan of oil in the first place. ... ms o\u2019connell: can i put it to you that you\u2019re constantly critical of the mother, would you agree with that? the father: of some behaviours. ... ms o\u2019connell: i said you\u2019re critical of her for working too much, aren\u2019t you? the father: yes, yes. ms o\u2019connell: some people might say the mother has got a great work ethic, but you approach it from the other way, you\u2019re critical, correct? the father: i\u2019m sure she has a great work ethic. she prioritises that over the children\u2019s needs, consistently. ... ms o\u2019connell: and you\u2019re critical of the mother because she has taken the children regularly to a [country d] [restaurant] and on occasion you\u2019ve heard that she has worked in the [restaurant], is that right? the father: that\u2019s correct. ms o\u2019connell: yes? the father: and the children are upstairs in a room and being \u2013 for a better word, neglected on that weekend, every second weekend. when i cherish the time i have with my children, [the mother] is choosing to prioritise working in a [restaurant] and not being paid, so it\u2019s not for financial gain, to forego that time, that quality time with the children and they\u2019re upstairs. and i\u2019ve had a facetime conversation with [w] a couple of weeks ago on a saturday evening. i was at [a sports match] and [w] was on tiktok, so i knew she was online, so i called, and there she is, and i think it\u2019s in my affidavit, maybe 9.30 pm. the time is not the issue, it\u2019s a saturday evening. [z] is there in his [puffer] jacket. that demonstrates to me it might be a cold environment, but that is upstairs away from their mother on a saturday evening which i would be spending with my children, with my children. [the mother] also mentions that she has got flexible working hours, yet, on occasion, she is late to get the children from [after school care] by 6.30 pm. there you go. ... ms o\u2019connell: because you know that the mother is friends with the owner of the [restaurant]? the father: mmm. ms o\u2019connell: very good friends. they socialise, right? the father: mmm. ms o\u2019connell: and so, the mother has been there and helped out on, she says, a couple of occasions, and the kids have been there with her? the father: no, no. the kids are in the same building. the kids are upstairs, isolated, neglected, abandoned. ms o\u2019connell: that\u2019s something you don\u2019t know, is it \u2013 isn\u2019t it? the father: i had a facetime call with my daughter, and as you said earlier, [w] is very intelligent and she tells me these things. ms o\u2019connell: yes. yes? the father: yes. yes. ms o\u2019connell: and she wasn\u2019t abandoned, was she? the father: you said she was there with her mother. she wasn\u2019t in the same room as her mother. her mother is downstairs. and it\u2019s a video of her mother [working], moving glasses around. ms o\u2019connell: yes. okay. but - - - ? the father: that\u2019s great, but the children are not with their mother on a saturday evening. they\u2019re upstairs away while she\u2019s working for \u2013 not for financial gain, so don\u2019t need the money. what are you foregoing that time for, not to be with your children. that\u2019s my concern. ... ms o\u2019connell: and you seem to know a lot about what you think the mother is doing on a weekend, is that a fair comment? the father: that\u2019s right. ms o\u2019connell: and you\u2019ve got that from the children, have you? the father: yes, from [w]. [emphasis added] summary of mother\u2019s case and witnesses ... in around march 2020, [the father] moved back to the [suburb o] property. the children's arrangements did not revert to 10 night/4 night fortnightly regime during school terms pursuant to the orders. [mr maletta] and i agreed for the children to spend equal time with us as the children were more or less home-schooled due to melbourne's covid-19 pandemic lockdowns. once the pandemic lockdowns lifted in late 2020, i asked [the father] for the children's arrangements to revert to the 10 night/4 night fortnightly school term regime. at that time, my rental property in [suburb o] was within 8 kms from the children's school. i wanted to provide the children with stability with their return to the classroom in [suburb [v]]. ... around this time, i believe that [the father] was living in a rental property in [suburb v]. subsequently, he moved into his parents\u2019 home in [suburb w]. for a period, he lived in [suburb o] primarily and spent time at his parents' home when the children were in his care. i am not sure as to the dates and [the father\u2019s] movements during this period as he did not update me with regard to his constant changes in residence. i understand that [the father] now lives at a 5-bedroom home that he recently purchased in [suburb r]. ... (4) i agree for the children to spend the term 3 2022 holidays with the father, given that the term 2 2022 holidays were spent with me. i acknowledge that the father is making plans to travel with the children. this is exciting for them and i wholeheartedly support this. ... (17) i agree with the recommendation for a parenting coordinator to be appointed to assist [the father] and i with the implementation of the final parenting orders and to reduce conflict between us. ... i refer to paragraph 190 of the report and say that i have not raised any concerns regarding the amount of time the children spend with each parent since march 2021 because i have been too afraid to challenge [the father] and make him angry. i have sought to be cooperative and amicable to avoid a constant cycle of arguments and fights with him. notwithstanding, the children's best interests must be prioritised. i feel that the children's emotional stability, developmental and academic progress depends upon them primarily living in a protective and nurturing home environment. i believe that i continue to provide this environment for the children. ... ... i am concerned that [ms p\u2019s] recommendation for equal time does not take into account the following matters (amongst others): i refer to paragraph 58 of the report. i was extremely nervous on the day that i was to be interviewed by [ms p]. i also felt weary from the emotional toll of these proceedings had had and were continuing to have on me. i just wanted the conflict to end. given the high conflict between us since separation, i have been willing to compromise on matters which i consider to be in the children's best interests, in the hope that my compromise will reduce the conflict between [the father] and i. the conflict has continued despite my compromises. during the family report interview, i expressed to [ms p] that it was my preference for the children to primarily live with me, so that they will have a stable home and continuity of lifestyle during the school terms. i further expressed that i was willing to agree to equal time arrangements for the children. upon reflection, i expressed this sentiment to [ms p] simply to reach an agreement with [the father] and put an end to these proceedings. i literally gave up during the interview. after considering the situation further, i do not agree that an equal time arrangement is truly in the children's best interests. ... generally, [the father] is a loving, devoted father. i encourage the children in their relationship with [the father]. he is a fun dad who loves his children and the children clearly benefit from their growing connection with him. i am always careful not to speak badly about [the father] to the children or to question the children about him. i respect his time with the children. i refer to [ms p's] comments as follows: \u201c[w] said that her mother does not say anything bad about her father.\u201d (paragraph 157 of the report) \u201c[z] said that his mother does not talk about his father.\u201d (paragraph 177 of the report) ... i am highly educated and i come from a family of professionals. my parents were [educators] and my sister is a [professional] in [country d]. i hold [business degrees and qualifications] in [country d]. ... the mother\u2019s lateness for events the secondary school issue authorities on the secondary school issue with respect to the power of the court to order private schooling and the cost of same as a parenting order when the parents don\u2019t consent to private schooling, no relevant authorities have been found to support such power of the court. with respect to the power of the court to make an order that the mother contribute to private school fees - not that this remains in issue given the father's amended position[2] - counsel refers his honour to: 1. love v henderson [1995] famca 160, (1996) flc 92-653, per kay j, particularly: \u201cit is common, and indeed this case represents the normal situation, for the court to require a party to meet the costs of transporting the child to or from access. in this case, the mother is responsible for the air fares to bring the children to melbourne. in one sense, that is a child support consideration, because s 117 specifically makes reference to the high costs involved in enabling a parent to have access to a child. it would not be unreasonable, in my view, not outside power, for the court to impose other conditions on access, which would of their nature involve economic expenditure, or the provision of goods and services which are capable of being acquired by economic expenditure, so that, for instance if one party owned a beach house, if the custodial parent owned a beach house, the court could order that parent to make the house available for an access period for the non-custodial parent.\u201d ... (and) [ellipses in original] \u201cunder s 64, in proceedings in relation to the access to a child, i may make such order as i consider proper and i must regard the welfare of the child as the paramount consideration. in my view this is the dominant section. it gives me almost unbridled powers to make orders which will promote the welfare of the child. where the legislation does not otherwise allow for the provision of financial support to an access parent, in my view, i can come back to the broad powers contained ins 64 to find the necessary power ...\u201d 2. stewart & stewart [2017] famcafc 67 per bryant cj, aldridge & kent jj, particularly: [l7] \u201chowever, a fundamental difficulty with this contention is, as will shortly be demonstrated, that at no point in the proceedings below did the mother seek or advance orders having the effect that the mother would solely bear this liability eliminating any recourse by the mother to seek contribution from the father via the child support agency.\u201d ... (and) [l9] \u201cwhilst without the benefit of full argument on a point not specifically raised by any grounds of the appeal we do not express a concluded view upon it, our preliminary view as expressed during the hearing is that it is difficult to see how orders for the mother to be solely responsible for private school fees could be characterised as a \"child maintenance order ... against, or in favour of [the father]\" within the meaning of s 66e(l).\u201d tation not in original] 7] there is no legal presumption that favours a child\u2019s primary carer choosing the relevant school that the child attends: re g, children\u2019s schooling (re g), low & chapman. consequently, there is no onus of proof cast on either party in the determination of the application. [108] the day-to-day reality of where a child does reside predominantly with one parent is, however, of relevance. in general, it will commonly be in a child\u2019s best interests to attend school which is close to his or her predominant place of residence: bilz & breugelman, re g. however, to state a general principle in that form necessarily invites attention to the anterior questions: what is the child\u2019s predominant place of residence? why is it in a child\u2019s best interests concerning attendance at a school which, although close to one residence, is distant from the other? [109] the parents\u2019 interests in securing an arrangement that is convenient for them is a matter that is appropriate to take into account: eden & eden-proust. this is because, while the interests of the child are required to be the paramount consideration, s 60ca does not provide that those interests are the sole consideration: ams v aif, eden & eden-proust. it follows that some regard should be had to the relative inconvenience to each of the parents with respect to matters such as any necessary transport arrangements: eden & eden-proust. [110] for example, in low & chapman, monahan j observed that to enrol a child at a school which was located at a place mid-point between the parties\u2019 residences was perhaps \u2018an obvious option\u2019 where the parties live some distance apart. i did not understand his honour to be suggesting any more than that such an option may be an obvious point for consideration alongside any other suitable options. [111] while it will ordinarily be of importance to consider the effect on the resident parent, this does not mean that the convenience of the non-resident parent is ignored: bilz & breugelman. again, it may be added that the distinction between a resident and non-resident parent becomes diluted where the parties have agreed upon a week about parenting arrangement, particularly one that has been on foot and to which the parties have adhered to for some years. [112] the views of the children may be a relevant but usually not a determinative consideration: s 60cc(3)(a) bilz & breugelman, re g. the child\u2019s views on schooling may be of lesser weight if the child is of a young age: stevens & mclaren. [113] the process of evaluating competing school proposals should not entail an assessment of the relative merits of the schools preferred by the parties, at least in circumstances where those schools are prima facie satisfactory: bilz & breugelman. the location of the school to the children\u2019s residence remains an important factor: re g. [114] the court may be assisted in the resolution of a schooling dispute by the opinions of an expert: stevens & mclaren. by s 60cd(2) the court may \u2018inform itself of views expressed by a child\u2019 by a number of means, including a report given to the court by a family consultant under s 62g(2) or, subject to the rules of court, \u2018by such other means as the court thinks appropriate\u2019: bondelmonte. [115] competing views have been expressed as to the relevance of the parties\u2019 agreement as to how schooling should be implemented. in eden & eden-proust, thackray j indicated that the existence of an agreement between parties would be an important factor. in re g, the parties\u2019 prior agreement on the issue was held not to carry much weight. 8] the day-to-day reality of where a child does reside predominantly with one parent is, however, of relevance. in general, it will commonly be in a child\u2019s best interests to attend school which is close to his or her predominant place of residence: bilz & breugelman, re g. however, to state a general principle in that form necessarily invites attention to the anterior questions: what is the child\u2019s predominant place of residence? why is it in a child\u2019s best interests concerning attendance at a school which, although close to one residence, is distant from the other?

the father: absolutely. yes. ms o\u2019connell: my client has held those passports. i understand you would like to travel with the children, and my client, of course, travels with the children to [country d]. her proposal is she holds both the passports, that she wants to hold both of them, so she can keep them up to date regularly. okay? the father: mmm. ms o\u2019connell: now, you say you don\u2019t agree to that, as i understand it. you want to hold one of them. is that right? the father: that\u2019s correct. ms o\u2019connell: yes. and why can\u2019t they just simply remain held by the mother? the father: okay. our legal situation that has been going on for four-plus years \u2013 i thought and i think the majority of the people in this room thought it was going to be culminating at the end of today. clearly, that is not going to be the case. sadly, i see my ex-wife as a flight risk, and i do not want my children just to be disappearing at some point - - - ms o\u2019connell: okay? the father: - - - and therefore one passport with me will prevent one child from travelling. i am never going to prevent my kids from travelling with their mother, but i will be able to sleep at night knowing that they can\u2019t just up and leave. ms o\u2019connell: and i put it to you you\u2019ve said nothing in her affidavit about her being a flight risk, have you? the father: no. but, ms o\u2019connell, the discussions of \u2013 like i said earlier, i \u2013 we all expected this to be done and dusted today, and it\u2019s not going to be. ms o\u2019connell: no. no. no, you can\u2019t talk about discussions outside of court. okay. i\u2019m just saying to you there\u2019s nothing in this material that you\u2019ve filed that she\u2019s a flight risk, is there? the father: no. ms o\u2019connell: no. and you\u2019ve said before that she owns property here in melbourne? the father: she owns a property, yes. ms o\u2019connell: yes. okay. and she has got a good job here too? the father: i believe she has a great job. i would love to know what she earns. ms o\u2019connell: yes. okay. all right. and in the event there were any necessity in the future for the children to have a [country d] passport for travel, you wouldn\u2019t be opposed to signing for that, would you? the father: i would not allow my children to have a [country d] passport. they have an australian passport. australian passport enables the children to travel more extensively internationally than a [country d] passport. why would they need a [country d] passport? ms o\u2019connell: okay. and why would you oppose it, can i ask? the father: it\u2019s unnecessary. ms o\u2019connell: yes. any other reason? the father: i don\u2019t believe [country d] is a signatory to the hague convention and the children could travel out of australia on a [country d] passport and vanish. only australian passports?

relationship break down? 13. ...(the \u201ctouchstone\u201d finding) is the seminal test to which the various \u201ccircumstances\u201d prescribed in s 4aa(2) are all directed. importantly, a court\u2019s discussion and consideration of particular circumstances found to be relevant in any one case should not be seen as giving rise to binding principles of law or as substituting for the words of the statute: sinclair v whittaker [2013] famcafc 129 at [94], and by definition, the actions of a party or parties which are said to be unequivocally indicative of and consistent only with, the cessation of the de facto relationship will vary from case to case. as the full court emphasised in sinclair v whittaker, every relationship is different. and as a marriage relies upon the continued existence of the consortium vitae, so too a de facto relationship relies upon the parties continuing to live as a couple on a genuine domestic basis as required by s4aa. each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point at one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test. 29. a de facto relationship will have broken down when, having regard to all the circumstances, the parties no longer \u201chave a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis\u201d. such a conclusion is not precluded by the presence of an ongoing relationship of some sort. that is not the inquiry. the question is whether a de facto relationship exists or has broken down. 30. in the context of a human relationship, \u201cbreakdown\u201d refers to the \u201cend\u201d or \u201cbreakup\u201d of what had been an enduring emotional bond... the lack of specificity in evidence and/or submissions about either the parties\u2019 actual declarations (viz there was no copy of the actual form) or the effect of such declarations upon the parties\u2019 competing evidence about the breakdown of the relationship, and (b) the inability to afford the parties proper procedural fairness to argue the application (or otherwise) of the \u201cthe elias principle\u201d. the inability to afford the parties

suicidality and is hospitalised: mother continues to facilitate a relationship between the father and x: further coercive behaviour: ...such a miserable fuck. i have done everything i possibly can to

best interests findings in this case: the question for [mr jennett] is whether a life-long history of emotional dysregulation and fractious relationships can be turned around. it has always been my professional opinion that the father did not, in fact, require psychiatric intervention but that process was followed because of certain requirements laid down by either the legal profession or the family/circuit court. the treatment plan has been, for some time, a general counselling program to assist the father to deal with the ongoing family law issues that he was embroiled in. has had relatively minor issues in the past with alcohol and [illicit substances]. since 2020, [mr jennett]\u2019s symptoms have significantly improved, and, on assessment on 6 december [2022] [mr jennett] did not appear depressed, and he reported to have a much reduced alcohol intake with no periods of intoxication. he is in stable employment and has not been in any trouble with the police since mid-2021. [mr jennett]\u2019s improvement is likely the result of having attended drug and alcohol counselling, engaging in dv psychoeducation, regular psychotherapy, compliance with his prescribed medication and a significant reduction in his alcohol intake. with ongoing regular therapy and mental health review and continued minimal use of alcohol (if abstinence is not possible), it is likely that [mr jennett]\u2019s prognosis is good. [mr jennett]\u2019s commitment to being a father to his daughter is a protective factor. while [mr jennett] demonstrates certain personality vulnerabilities (fear of abandonment, impulsive destructive behaviours when upset, emotional dysregulation, suicidal behaviour), most likely due to the trauma experienced during his childhood, he does not meet criteria for the diagnosis of a personality disorder or a trauma-related disorder such as post-traumatic stress disorder. moreover, with psychotherapy and psychoeducation, he seems to have developed skills to recognise and modify and/or manage these vulnerabilities. in [mr jennett]\u2019s case, his parenting capacity is most likely to be affected if he has a relapse of his alcohol use disorder. as such, he needs to continue to limit his alcohol use as he is doing currently, and should attend alcoholics anonymous or some similar support group on a regular basis. conclusion & orders: associate: dated: 5 may 2023 dated: 5 may 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "928.txt", "size": 30407, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 30686, "document_id": "928"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "928_chunk_0"}}

the mother filed on 12 july 2021 in which she sought, among other things, the discharge of the final parenting orders that i made on 15 october 2020. in that application the mother sought, among other things, orders for sole parental responsibility of the children x born in 2012 (\u2018x\u2019) and y born in 2014 (\u2018y\u2019), that x and y live with her, and for any future time between the father and the children to be supervised. 2 as part of that application the mother raised a range of extremely serious allegations against the father including physical abuse of the children. she had made at or around the time she filed the application in this court, reports to both the victoria police and the department of families, fairness and housing (\u2018dffh\u2019). when the matter came before me for first return, the parties agreed to attend upon ms q (\u2018ms q\u2019) for a short form family report which has now been produced to me. as a result of that report, the father now brings an application (supported by the icl) to have the children live with him and for the mother's time with the children to be supervised. background 3 this is a matter which i have a great deal of familiarity. the orders i made on 15 october 2020 were made after a trial on parenting and property issues. at that time following that trial i made final orders that the children live with the mother and spend time with the father, ultimately working up to an arrangement where they spent every alternate tuesday night with the father and then alternate weekends from friday through to monday. the orders i made were made after i made findings in relation to the risk posed by the father to the children. i also made those orders balancing the other considerations that i am required to balance under section 60cc of the family law act 1975 act (\u2018act\u2019). 4 detailed reasons were issued underpinning my findings. i made findings, relevant for the purpose of this application, about the mother at paragraphs [88] and [89] of my reasons for judgment delivered on 15 october 2020, including findings that the mother had embellished the evidence before me to support her application in respect of the children. i also made findings that the mother was not likely to or would not support a relationship between the children and the father. at paragraph [93] of my reasons i referred to the section 11f report of the family consultant, and at paragraphs [95] to [96] of my decision i summarised the family report. paragraphs [93] to [96] of my decision provide as follows: 93. the parties attended for a child inclusive conference on 19 july 2019. the 11f report was prepared a matter of months after the respondent returned from country g and after the respondent claims that the children made concerning disclosures to her. notwithstanding this, consultant ms n recorded the following observation between the children and the applicant: \u2018both children reported they wanted to see their father. they said they missed their paternal grandmother and their cousins.\u2019 \u2018on observation, the children ran to their father jumped into his arms and gave him hugs. the father became emotional and the children asked him why he was crying. he gained control of his emotions and told them he missed them and was pleased to see them. he then interacted with them in a familiar and comfortable fashion, they showed him pictures and played sports. the interaction did not seem forced and they all seemed to become more relaxed as the time progressed. the paternal grandmother also spent time with the children and their reactions to her were similar. they ran and hugged her and interacted with her with ease.' 94. on the basis of those observations, consultant ms n recommended that the children commence spending supervised time with the applicant and that professional supervision occur. the family report 95. i have already referred in some detail to the content of the family report. in addition to the matters that i have referred to above, it is important to record that consultant ms m observed that the children had a loving and positive relationship with their father. so much can be seen from the following extracts: x expressing joy when speaking about her father and stating that she loves him to \u2018infinity\u2019, and wanting to spend more time with him, albeit not overnight because she would miss her mother (paragraph 81 of the family report), y also stating that he loved his father to \u2018infinity\u2019 and wanted to spend more time with him, his nana and his cousins, albeit not overnight because he would miss his mum (paragraph 90 of the family report), both children greeting the applicant by \u2018running up to him and giving him a hug\u2019 (paragraph 95 of the family report), x completing a painting which she made for her father which said \u2018i love you dad\u2019 (paragraph 97 of the family report), the observation of consultant ms m that \u2018the children were seen to have a positive relationship with their father and showed no signs of fear or distress around him and they appeared comfortable pushing the boundaries. mr bickford also presented with appropriate parenting skills to manage their behaviour in a positive manner and was not punitive\u2019 (paragraph 99 of the family report). 96. it must be observed that the tenor of these reports is overwhelmingly positive for the applicant. the picture painted by both report writers is diametrically different to what the respondent reports about the children. the short form family report 5 i have since been provided with the most recent family report of ms q dated 12 september 2021. at paragraph [41] of the report ms q outlined her observations of the mother and the mother\u2019s husband who appeared cheerful and optimistic, and at paragraph [42], ms q noted the somewhat incongruent behaviour of the mother and her partner with the serious matters that were raised in respect to the children. the mother's unwillingness to discuss the recent allegations of violence she had made, at paragraph [43] of that report are also noted. 6 ms q\u2019s observations of the children with their father and her record of the interview with the children is of great significance. paragraphs [60] to [75] of ms q's report provide as follows: 60. the children arrived with their mother for their interviews and observation session. for the majority of their time together, they played a card game called \u201cfrustration,\" which they felt was appropriate given the current pandemic. ms bickford interacted with the children in a childfocused manner, and it was good communication between the children and their mother, which was predominantly focused on the game at hand. while ms bickford demonstrated a high emotional attunement with the children, it was noticeable that x continually interacted with the writer, indicating that she may have felt not including the writer in their interactions as a social faux. 61. x initially impressed as anxious and scared during her interview. when x was asked about the purpose of her interview, she provided a long narrative of her understanding of her parents' conflict from her mother's perspective. she cited information regarding the \u201clies\u201d her father had allegedly written in his affidavit material, conversations which reportedly occurred in court, emphasising that \u201cmr bickford lied to the judge\u201d, \u201cmum says that she has proof and photographs\u201d, \u201cmr bickford wants me and my brother to live with him\u201d, and \u201cmum won in court\u201d. understandably, x was considerably confused regarding who had actually said what in court, confirming that she was not there and that this was relayed to her by her mother. x confirmed, \"mum wants us to know all of the things that dad says in court.\u201d 62. for clarity, when x was asked to name family members, she explained that she called mr b \"dad\" and that mr bickford \"mr bickford\" [sic], however, she called mr bickford \"dad\" when she spent time with him because he likes her and her brother to call him \"dad.\u201d 63. in discussing the conflict between her parents, x reported that her mother had told her \u201cmr bickford was really mean to her\u201d when they were together and that he had thrown keys at her \u201cabout four years ago\u201d. x stated, \u201cmum said mr bickford is not a safe person.\u201d 64. x reported that her parents had gone to court and that she and her brother were to spend time with her father every tuesday and every second weekend, reporting that on weekends they generally spent this time in city u. overall, x reported that she enjoyed spending time in city u with her father and \u201cms s,\u201d and she enjoyed spending time with her paternal family and her cousins. 65. in discussing the purpose of her interview, x explained, \"mum wants us to tell you the bad things about mr bickford.\" when she was asked why she thought her mother did not want her to tell the good things about mr bickford, she stated, \u201cmum doesn\u2019t like mr bickford very much.\u201d 66. when x was asked what bad things her mother wanted her to report about mr bickford, x stated, \"all of the lying, all of the hurting and all of the yelling.\" she reported that during the last visit with her father that y did not want to brush his teeth, and he was \"rude to dad.\u201d she claimed that mr bickford had grabbed y and made him brush his teeth and claiming that this was child abuse and that her mother took photographs, and they made a statement to victoria police. according to x, the next day, she and her brother had fun with their father at the waterpark in city u. 67. when x was asked how she would feel about spending time with her father, she indicated that she was nervous and scared and stated, \"i don't want to see him, i'm scared.\u201d when x was asked the source of her fear, she explained that she was anxious that her mother did not want her to see her father. she further confirmed that she was less anxious and scared spending time with her father when she was collected from school. furthermore, the writer asked if she would be less anxious and scared about seeing her father if her mother was required to leave the premises. x confirmed this. 68. before the children were interviewed further, x was returned to the room with her mother and ms bickford was asked to leave before mr bickford arrived. after this time, the children were interviewed together. 69. when y was asked why he believed he was being interviewed today, both he and x attempted to explain to the writer the details of the dramatic court scene which reportedly took place earlier that month (11th august 2021). the children talked over each other as they attempted to explain \u201cmr bickford\u2019s lies,\u201d that their father was trying to take them from their mother, and they were confused whether or not he wished to remove v from their mother too. x told her brother, \"mum said mr bickford wanted to separate us from v,\" which led the children to conclude the maybe their father did not want v to live with him also. 70. the children debated about what the 'the judge' had said or what other lawyers had said, and they agreed that \u201cmum had won in court and now we don\u2019t have to see mr bickford.\" the children confirmed that they had been provided with a detailed account of the most recent court hearing by their mother and that this was notably important and dramatic. 71. when the writer innocently asked why their parents had to go to court, the children jointly explained that this was because \"mr bickford lies\" and because of \"child abuse.\" when y was asked to describe what had happened at his father's home, he stated that he did not want to brush his teeth, and his father picked him up and threw him around the room. y started spinning around the room and dramatically acted out his father spinning him around and bashing his head on a bathroom sink. both the children were laughing, and x stated, \u201cno he didn\u2019t\u201d. y confirmed that he had a bruise and a cut under his arm from his t-shirt. he confirmed that the following night he brushed his teeth when he was told to. y stated, \u201ci don\u2019t want to see mr bickford ever again.\u201d 72. the writer indicated that she was going to call their father into the building, whom she understood was nearby. in discussing this with the children. y became excited and wanted to know where his father was when what time he would be coming. x indicated that she was no longer scared or anxious about seeing her father and indicated that since her mother had left that she was now excited to see her father. x confirmed that she was more anxious and scared about her mother being upset about her seeing her father rather than being anxious and scared about actually seeing her father. 73. when mr bickford entered the room, the children enjoyed an emotional reunion. within two (2) minutes of mr bickford entering the room, y looked at the writer and, in the presence of his father, stated, \u201ci\u2019ve changed my mind, i do want to see dad, i want to live with both mum and dad the same.\u201d 74. while mr bickford attempted to engage in games and activities for the children, this was unsuccessful as the children spent their time climbing over their father and providing him with multiple hugs and kisses, which continually disrupted any activity they attempted. the children did not appear to be uncomfortable or scared by their father in any way. they competed for his physical attention, stated that they loved and missed him and y, in particular, continually climbed on his father's shoulders using him as a climbing frame. 75. the writer experienced difficulties separating the children from their father at the end of this observation session as they continually wish to run back to their father to have their ninth and tenth hug. the children continually asked their father when they would be seeing him next, and y stated that he wanted to leave with him that afternoon. when the children had successfully separated from their father, and he was walking out the door, the children spotted his partner, ms s, through the glass door and immediately ran out to greet her, also providing her with multiple hugs and kisses. unfortunately, this elongated the children\u2019s departure from their father even longer, and the process of attempting to separate the children from him needed to be repeated. at various times during this observation session, both mr bickford and the children were in tears. 7 i note the uncanny similarity between ms q\u2019s observations of the father with the children and the observations made by the section 11f report writer prior to the trial. 8 paragraphs [83] to [91] of ms q's report then provide as follows: 83. mr bickford claims that ms bickford has brought vexatious claims against him due to the previous history of this dating back to almost three (3) years. paragraph 89 of judge blake's judgement dated 15th october 2020 indicated his belief that ms bickford did not have the capacity or willingness to support the children's relationship with mr bickford. unfortunately, this appears to have continued post-final orders. 84. this assessment has also reinforced that despite judge blake making orders that the children are to be encouraged to refer to mr bickford \u201cdad,\" both mr and ms bickford maintain that the children continue to refer to mr bickford as mr bickford within their home, which is confirmed by the children. 85. unfortunately, the children\u2019s interviews have revealed that they have continued to be excessively exposed to their mother\u2019s wholly negative views of their father. it was notable that both children reported that they had been exposed to their mother\u2019s accounts of the most recent interim hearing, which was obviously confusing for them. it was especially concerning that ms bickford has clearly informed that the children regarding their father had \"lied to the judge\" and that their mother had \"won in court.\u201d this tends to suggest that ms bickford\u2019s attempts to influence the children to her views and wishes overrides her concern for their exposure to adult concepts and stressors. 86. the children\u2019s exposure to their mother\u2019s views and wishes is beginning to have a considerable emotional impact upon the children. during her interview, x identified that she felt scared and anxious about spending time with her father when her mother was in the building. this fear and anxiety clearly overrode her reported fear over her father's violence against her and her brother, for once her mother was out of the building, x (and y) demonstrated an affectionate and loving relationship towards their father. similarly, y informed that writer that he did not want to see his father again until he was reunited with him. he then reported that he wanted to spend the same amount of time with each parent. 87. despite the significant risk of harm ms bickford has reported in relation to the children, the children clearly enjoyed a loving and affectionate relationship with him. as stated above, during this preliminary assessment, the writer experienced difficulties separating the children from their father, and y specifically requested to leave with this father that afternoon. the children\u2019s behaviour towards their father did not raise any safety concerns for the children within his care. 88. the court may need to determine whether mr bickford poses such a significant risk to the children that the children\u2019s time with their father requires ongoing supervision or whether the final orders made by judge blake are reinstated. 89. notwithstanding the above, this assessment also suggests that ms bickford has no capacity to promote the children's relationship with their father and therefore, it is highly likely that the children may once again be encouraged to report possible exaggerated accounts of violence within their father's care to professionals, which in itself exposes the children to emotional and psychological harm. 90. it is mr bickford\u2019s position that the children will be continually exposed to their mother\u2019s views and wishes and encouraged to exaggerate or fabricate incidents of violence against him until such time as the children begin to believe these falsehoods and ultimately, their relationship with him is severed. unfortunately, this assessment tends to support this view as, notwithstanding the allegations surrounding mr bickford\u2019s possible assault of y, the children\u2019s interviews appeared to be more focused on the views and wishes of their mother in the drama surrounding the most recent court proceeding. 91. it is therefore suggested that in the event the court determines that the children are not placed at significant risk within their father\u2019s care, that consideration should be given to the children living primarily with their father and spending time with their mother in order to protect them from the ongoing exposure to their mother\u2019s negative views, and additional investigative and legal processes. the application 9 the application before me by the father is an application made in an interim hearing and the principles of goode v goode [2006] famca 1346 apply. i cannot make findings of fact, and, unsurprisingly, in a matter as contentious as this, there is little agreed facts between the parties. 10 i am required to determine this matter having regard to the factors set out in section 60cc of the act, and also having regard to the paramount consideration of making orders in the best interest of the children. the principal considerations set out in section 60cc(2) are the principal factors engaged in this case, and, in particular, an appropriate assessment of the extent of any harm posed to the children by either parent. here, when the material before the court is looked at, the family report writer's observations are in stark contrast to the mother's serious allegations against the father. 11 it is clear from ms q\u2019s observations that these children have no fear of their father, that they love him and that it is difficult for them to separate from him. it is apparent from ms q's report that the children embellished the story of the incident that occurred in the bathroom with the father. these matters and the other comments made by ms q point very strongly against there being any serious risk posed by the father to these children. 12 the mother has made serious allegations of abuse and violence. i have weighed them carefully. ordinarily, in a case like this they would be given very significant weight. however that is not the case here today, given the content of ms q's report, given the children's observed recent interactions with their father, given my previous findings about the mother's embellishment of her evidence and given the mother's late submission that time with the father should now be reinstated. 13 the mother's reports to the dffh and the police need to be addressed. ms q gave little weight to the dffh report that was before her, and so do i, given the extensive interaction that ms q has now had with the children. the status of any report that the mother made about the father to the police is unclear. it may be that serious allegations are contained there, but, equally, i cannot wait for those. indeed, i have been given direct evidence now about the threat, if there is any, from the father to the children, given i have the report of ms q. 14 counsel for the mother submitted eloquently that she ought not be punished for acting protectively. i accept that is a matter i need to weigh, but the evidence tends to suggest that the mother has done much more than simply act protectively. ms q\u2019s report discloses that the mother - and i note she denies this - has discussed the state of proceedings with the children. the mother and her husband appear to have gathered evidence by way of secret recordings at least of the family consultant, and potentially others, in order to bolster her case. i pause to observe that on one view, that would look to amount to potentially a breach of the act, and potentially a breach of other legislation such as the surveillance devices act 1999. i am not asked to do anything about those matters today, but it seems to me they are extremely serious allegations. in the circumstances, the mother has done more than act protectively. the manner in which she has conducted herself both before me at trial, and apparently since then, discloses an agenda whereby she seems stop at nothing to get the result that she wants. her conduct since trial tends to support, in that sense, the observations i made about her at trial. 15 it is not a decision to be made lightly to remove children from their primary carer, and i accept, as the mother\u2019s counsel says, that removing the children from their friends and family may well have some impact on them. it is, indeed, a very significant step to remove children in an interim hearing. 16 in the ordinary course i would be very reluctant to do so. here, however, i have concluded, given the content of the family report from ms q, that this is one of those rare cases where orders should be made immediately placing the children in the care of their father. the emotional, psychological and welfare risks to the children appears too great, given the apparent conduct of the mother that emerges from the evidence. the risk to the children's emotional wellbeing and mental health is very significant. quite apart from the matters outlined in ms q\u2019s report, i observe from long involvement with this matter that this will be the third occasion that the children have been before a family consultant, and that they have also been exposed to further police and also to dhhs involvement. there is a real chance not only of emotional harm inflicted by the mother, but emotional harm inflicted from what can only be described as systems abuse, and the mother seems apparently unconcerned about the damage that may result. 17 the mother\u2019s counsel said that the mother had taken on board the comments of ms q and my comments earlier today prior to making these orders. that seems to me too little, too late. i made it very clear in my judgment what i thought about her conduct. to come here today and say that she now regards herself as being on notice, in my view, does not adequately address the seriousness of the conduct with which i am confronted and the impacts on the children. i will list the matter for trial on 1 to 3 june 2022 and make the usual trial directions. 18 finally, the father\u2019s counsel sought that i make an order that the short form family report be permitted to be placed before the magistrate\u2019s court in the intervention order proceedings. i decline to make that order (for the reasons that i discussed with mr ambrose). what i will do is ensure that a written record of these ex tempore reasons is published and given to the parties. insofar as the magistrate\u2019s court proceedings are concerned, i note that the mother\u2019s counsel indicated that the mother was prepared as part of the orders she sought, and which i have not acceded to, to withdraw the intervention order proceedings against the father in light of ms q\u2019s report. in my view, that is something that should happen now and ought to obviate the need for the father\u2019s counsel to require any family report. associate: dated: 28 october 2021", "metadata": {"filename": "93.txt", "size": 34014, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1,

evidence of family violence, the appellant had called no evidence to suggest that the violence had made her contributions more onerous. this submission overlooks the obvious point that the court can infer from appropriate evidence that there was a nexus between the conduct and the relevant contributions. findings of fact[14] real property bought and sold by the parties the various family

parties\u2019 home and called the police. she hid in the home until the police arrived. while the police were there, the husband returned to the property. the police asked him to leave, and he did. the wife was concerned that he would return after the police left, as he had previously told her that he was not scared of the police and she believed him. mr h and the other two children, who were present at home on the night, were frightened, and mr h said to the mother that she should go and stay with her mother and that they would be ok. the wife made the decision to leave the home and spent

(8) the mother and father and their servants and agents are restrained from: by way of background: you\u2019re nothing but a fucking deadbeat. you\u2019re a serious fucking drop kick. too focused on your piece-of-shit car. don\u2019t come back to this house. i will make an arrangement when the children aren\u2019t here to come get your shit. you come here and i will call the police, so fuck off. 10 minutes later the mother sent a further text message that provided: most of your shit is at the front door. your hanging clothes, you can pick up tomorrow at lunchtime when i\u2019m home, and i will take my keys back at the same time. you step foot onto my house and i will have you arrested. mother: i\u2019ve had them for the last two weeks, so yes, you are taking them friday. father: cry me a river. you spat the little cherubs out. no rest, eh. the father was taken to another exchange: mother: i sincerely apologise for ruining your life. i really am. can\u2019t go back and change that. we have two children now, so can you please just focus on that. father: no. you just want time off. they\u2019re hard work. you don\u2019t give a fuck about the kids and any relationship they have with their dad. you use them as a pawn. you threatened to cut access twice these evening. you dropped them off with me to fuck off and go get your fuck on with \u2013 on whether with old mate here or old mate in [city f] or wherever you\u2019ve duped poor idiot. i\u2019m not an idiot. stop trying to pull the wool over my eyes, you f. why is that? is it too fucking hard to pick them up when you pick him up? what shoes did he have to walk out in? so now because of your pure incompetence i have a crying child wanting his [g shoes]. that\u2019s it. you\u2019re no longer allowed to pick them up from day care. fucking hopeless. one fucking job and you can\u2019t even do that. i want my kids back and i will do whatever it takes to get them back and if i ever see you touch the kids i will bash you. mr o\u2019brien: so you agree that you sent that message, do you, sir? father: ---in response to your client\u2019s email \u2013 text. i see. i see?--- mr obrien: sir, do you recall saying: fuck that dog \u2013 father: in respect of [mr h]? mr o\u2019brien: fuck that dog idiot. must have a brain injury to put up with you. father: that\u2019s pretty savage. sounds like something i might say, yes. i don\u2019t know. i don\u2019t remember it exactly, but yes. mr cohen: the father never granted you permission to move - - -? mother: ---no. mr cohen: - - - did he? mother: ---no, he did not. i believe that he has such a hatred for me that given the opportunity, he will harm those kids, and i don\u2019t want my kids being a statistic and have them thrown off the [o bridge], so, you know, i want to protect my kids and do everything i can to make sure that they\u2019re safe, and i don\u2019t think they\u2019re safe with him at all. i\u2019m sorry. (transcript 8 nov\u2019 2022, p.290). ms carter: you were asked by mr cohen about the father\u2019s behaviour towards the children a bit earlier this afternoon, and it was suggested to you that in terms of [mr otero]\u2019s conduct towards the children, there has been no allegations or suggestions made by you that he has been abusive towards the children other than that event in late 2020, is that right? mother: ---correct. ms carter: and other than the father\u2019s conduct which you saw in court in august and the information that you\u2019ve read in the family report, there has been nothing between august and today that would suggest to you that the father is at risk of physical harm to the children? mother: ---not physical harm, no. after the observation, the cce said to [mr otero] that the experience must have been difficult. [mr otero] called the cce an \u201coxygen thief\u201d and told her that it was another example of her \u201cfucking incompetence.\u201d he said that there was no benefit to the observation and there is no accountability. he stated that he did not know \u201cwhat you (the cce) expected to achieve by deliberately upsetting the children.\u201d he said that if he did not participate it is on him, but did the cce understand that the children drove three hours to attend the appointment and [y] gets car sick after an hour and a half in the car. the cce concluded the assessment with [mr otero] at this time. whilst it is clear, in the independent children\u2019s lawyer\u2019s submission, that the father\u2019s conduct in the interviews and in court was offensive and disrespectful, the father\u2019s behaviour also needs to be considered in the following context: the father\u2019s actions did not take place in front of the children, (2) the father has not seen children in 2 years, (3) there has not been compliance with past orders providing for time between the children and the father, (4) the mother relocated interstate with the children without notice to the father, (5) the father gave evidence to the effect that that he has been extremely stressed as a result of these proceedings and parenting dispute. whilst this does not excuse the father\u2019s behaviour, it provides some context for such behaviour when it might otherwise be given greater emphasis when examined in isolation. the father\u2019s time with the children be conditional upon his compliance with the following: that within 14 days the father shall attend upon his current mental health provider. the father shall do all things reasonably necessary to obtain a written report/letter from the abovementioned mental health provider as to whether the father requires further treatment and if so, the frequency of same and confirmation that the father is compliant with any treatment he made be undergoing with that mental health provider. on receipt of the report/letter referred to in order 6(b) above, the father shall provide to the mother or her legal representative a copy of the report. the father shall continue to be compliant with any treatment that is recommended by the nominated mental health provider. in the event the father is not compliant pursuant to order 6(b) above, the father\u2019s time shall be suspended until such time that he furnishes evidence of compliance with any treatment that is recommended by the nominated mental health provider. that within 14 days the father shall attend upon his current mental health provider.

[ms p], you\u2019ve seen in the father\u2019s orders that he seeks that the children engage with a particular service in [city b] called [c family centre] for family therapy, and you\u2019re aware that children are currently undertaking some counselling with a counsellor. the evidence appears to be that they\u2019ve only had a couple of sessions with the counsellor and, thus far, the counselling has been unsuccessful. do you think it might be beneficial for there to be a new counsellor engaged specifically to provide family therapy, rather than trying to utilise the existing counsellors that seem only had a couple of sessions? ms p: ---it certainly could be beneficial. it would depend \u2013 therapy can \u2013 a big portion of therapy can depend on the rapport with the therapist as well, but engaging someone that is dealing with the whole family from the beginning could be beneficial, because it\u2019s a new \u2013 new insight, and i\u2019m assuming that they would have instruction, or the orders provided to them so that they would have an understanding of what the purpose is. judge myers: so is what you\u2019re saying looking at something with fresh eyes \u2013 being a new counsellor or being a new family therapist rather than engaging with the old? looking at it holistically with everybody afresh could be a better outcome, or potentially a better outcome. ms p: ---yes. it could be. yes. p]: i think that\u2019s why the proposal for a \u2013 sorry, a new intervention, a new therapist is there because it\u2019s a \u2013 as i was saying, it\u2019s a fresh view of the matter. you start from the beginning with everybody involved, because, as i said, i can only speak on how i would run the intervention to give you an idea, you know. it is something that i would meet with all parties separately initially, so [mr otero], [ms kasun], and then the children, to get an understanding of where everybody was at and then i would formulate my treatment plan. i think changing to a new therapist, gives that \u2013 that this is someone that\u2019s agreed rather than something that [ms kasun] has chosen for the children, would be my understanding of why it may work better for [mr otero] to suggest that rather than the current therapist. mr cohen: and how many sessions would that \u2013 in terms of practicality, how many sessions would happen and how often would they be and who would they be with? [ms p]: ---well, as i said, initially i would meet with everybody, and then if i was doing an intervention with the children i would imagine that you would be expecting some level of change in about six to eight sessions, not necessarily a complete removal of all that they\u2019re experiencing, but if you were doing an intervention, you would be expecting some change between six and eight sessions. mr cohen: but, in terms of the father, the father could do those sessions by zoom or teams or something, by avl? [ms p]: ---certainly. yes, the \u2013 i mean, the benefit of the pandemic and the research behind the interventions that psychologists have done over zoom versus face-to-face is that, you know, they\u2019re still effective sessions with adults, so they certainly could happen for [mr otero] over a \u2013 over a video conference. mr o\u2019brien: so, you\u2019re aware of the event that the mother asserts occurred at the day care centre, correct? [ms p]: ---yes. mr o\u2019brien: if the children had witnessed that, that would be something which would be classified, presumably, as a traumatic event for them to witness, wouldn\u2019t it?\u2014 [ms p]: -yes. mr o\u2019brien: even if the children hadn\u2019t witnessed the mother being punched, but had witnessed the father laying lands on the mother during an argument about the children, that would have also been traumatic for them to witness, correct?--- [ms p]: that\u2019s correct. mr o\u2019brien: and if the youngest child recalls, rightly or wrongly, but recalls being hit by an open door when his father was reversing the car and knocked over, that would be something quite significant to a young child of that age, wouldn\u2019t it? [ms p]: ---yes. mr o\u2019brien: and that would engender negative feelings towards the parent who they perceived was the cause of that, wouldn\u2019t it? [ms p]: ---that\u2019s likely, yes. mr o\u2019brien: and it would cause perhaps a fear response in respect of that parent, wouldn\u2019t it? [ms p]: ---it could, yes. mr o\u2019brien: and it could certainly be something that really does shape their views in these proceedings of the father in a negative way, couldn\u2019t it? [ms p]: ---yes, yes. mr o\u2019brien: and the children, since that event, with the exception of your office, haven\u2019t spent any time with him, have they? [ms p]: ---no physical time, yes. no. mr o\u2019brien: so, it\u2019s likely that introducing the children to the father is problematic due to this event that they have experienced, isn\u2019t it? [ms p]: ---yes. ....the children each presented as strongly aligned with [ms kasun] and rejecting of a relationship with [mr otero], with both children stating that they did not want to spend time with him. given the history of care and the length of time since the children have spent time with [mr otero], the children\u2019s primary relationship would be with [ms kasun]. given the children\u2019s age and likely development stage combined with the length of time since they have spent time with [mr otero], it is recommended that limited weight be given to their views. the

whilst the welfare (or best interests) of the child are, by statute, the \u201cparamount\u201d consideration in the exercise of jurisdiction such as was invoked here, they are not the sole consideration. in this respect, the position in this country is different from that in canada. it more closely conforms to the language of the convention on the rights of the child. statutory instructions as to the paramountcy that is to be accorded to the child\u2019s welfare or best interests are to be understood as they apply to a child living in australian society, normally in relationship with both parents and other members of its family. whilst the legislation considered in this case, and later statutory reforms, give the highest priority to the child\u2019s welfare and best interests, that consideration does not expel every other relevant interest from receiving its due weight. in part, this is because (as the english courts recognised long ago) the enjoyment by parents of their freedoms necessarily impinges on the happiness of the child. but, in part, it is also because legislation such as fla 1975 and fca 1975 is enacted to take effect within a society of a particular character whose members enjoy a high measure of personal freedom, diminished only to the extent that the law obliges. whatever might be the legal characterisation of the right the mother may possess to move freely, it must be subordinated by her parenting obligations under the family law act. the best interests of the children are paramount. the legislation says as much in express terms. that within 14 days the father shall attend upon his current mental health provider. (b) the father shall do all things reasonably necessary to obtain a written report/letter from the abovementioned mental health provider as to whether the father requires further treatment including anger management counselling and if so, the frequency of same and confirmation that the father is compliant with any treatment he made be undergoing with that mental health provider. the father shall provide the said mental health practitioner a copy of these orders, reasons for decision and a copy of the family reports dated 6 october 2022 and 4 march 2022. the report/letter shall acknowledge that the author has been provided with and read these orders, reasons for decision and the said family reports.

[mr otero] said that this was not a child focused decision. he stated that there are hundreds of pages of documents and no one has bothered to speak to the children. [mr otero] said that there is very little accountability to the children\u2019s well-being. sydney and city b, where the parents live, are too far apart to make equal time or substantial and significant time reasonably practical, (b) the parent\u2019s current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time is so poor that such an arrangement is not reasonably practical, and (c) the impact that an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time would have on the children (given their level of resistance to spending time with the father) would be detrimental such that an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time would not be reasonably practical. the parent\u2019s current and future capacity to communicate with each other and resolve difficulties that might arise in implementing an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time is so poor that such an arrangement is not reasonably practical, and (c) the impact that an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time would have on the children (given their level of resistance to spending time with the father) would be detrimental such that an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time would not be reasonably practical. the impact that an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time would have on the children (given their level of resistance to spending time with the father) would be detrimental such that an arrangement of equal time or substantial and significant time would not be reasonably practical. associate: dated: 8 may 2023 dated: 8 may 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "932.txt", "size": 113634, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 114765, "document_id": "932"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "932_chunk_0"}}

net total assets $ where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) flc 92-816 the full court said at 85,262: \u201c11.6 for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out.\u201d (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654: where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654: \u201cin my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband\u2019s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly.\u201d (c) in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644: \u201cas a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. conduct of the kind referred to in para. (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under sec 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of sec 79.\u201d in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 at 76,644: where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. ... her honour seems to be saying that the mere fact that a party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation, will result in that expenditure being added back \u201cin the usual way\u201d as a premature distribution of assets with nothing more. if that is what her honour is saying, in our view, she is being unduly simplistic. in our opinion, it was a necessary requirement for her honour to examine and make some assessment of the reasonableness or otherwise of the expenditure. the husband\u2019s evidence in his trial affidavit at paragraphs 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 66, 67, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, (b) his oral evidence pertaining to importing a container from country af in relation to paragraph 66(b) of his trial affidavit, (c) his oral evidence relating to spending not more than $500 per week on food, fuel and travel and being part of his \u201cliving expenses\u201d referred to in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit, and, (d) his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit. his oral evidence pertaining to importing a container from country af in relation to paragraph 66(b) of his trial affidavit, (c) his oral evidence relating to spending not more than $500 per week on food, fuel and travel and being part of his \u201cliving expenses\u201d referred to in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit, and, (d) his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit. his oral evidence relating to spending not more than $500 per week on food, fuel and travel and being part of his \u201cliving expenses\u201d referred to in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit, and, (d) his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit. his oral evidence that the nab bank statements in annexure 12 to his trial affidavit relate to his expenditures toward the business and on living expenses as described by him in paragraph 66 of his trial affidavit. mortgage loan repayments for the former property at town u owned by the parties: a total of about $32,629. in this context, the court observes that the former property at town u was the only property with a mortgage loan outstanding from about september 2018 until june 2021, and there are references to income received (the court would infer rental income) and noted as credits in annexure 12 (eg, \u201ctown u\u201d on 1 june 2021), (b) payments to the business k pty ltd: a total of about $65,770, (c) payments to overseas creditors in relation to the above business, including importing expenses for this business: a total of about $73,034.

father the interview for depression revealed that [mr ismat] has likely been suffering from depression at various stages in his life since his teenage years. his current mood has also been adversely affected by his current predicament. at present, he is suffering from symptoms such as low self\u00ad esteem, hopelessness, sadness, loss of pleasure, irritability, poor decision-making, sleep problems, and loneliness. [mr ismat] grew up as a christian in [country j] and described the difficulties his family endured during the [country j] war, and subsequent united nations (un) sanctions, the 2003 invasion of [country j], and with the persecution of christians in post-war [country j]. [mr ismat] described symptoms that meant he likely suffered from his first bout of depression during his middle teens, not long after the cessation of the war. he seemed to recover after about two years and then suffered another bout of depression when [country j] was invaded, which coincided with the death of his father in 2003. once again, he seemed to recover from the depression, but became depressed again in the context of the economic hardship, religious persecution, and he constant threat of violence in post-war [country j]. [mr ismat] immigrated to the [country q] in 2012 and his mood improved. he was married in 2015 and moved to australia the same year. his mood began to deteriorate in late 2017 due to ongoing financial problems and difficulties within his marriage. at the time of the incident that led to current charges, [mr ismat] met the dsm v criteria for a major depressive episode, in the severe category. (italics added) the interview for depression revealed that [mr ismat] has likely suffered from generalised anxiety disorder since his teenage years. he is suffering from symptoms such as having difficulties relaxing, fear of the worst happening, nervousness, and fear. he developed anxiety in the context of growing up in an unstable, war-torn environment, where his and his family's safety was never certain. due to this he learned that he needed to be constantly on guard to assess for possible threats. at the time of the incident that led to current charges, [mr ismat] met the dsm v criteria for generalised anxiety disorder. (italics added) at the time of assessment, [mr ismat] was suffering from major depressive disorder and generalised anxiety disorder. while he also met the dsm v criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder. he is suffering from the following symptoms: intrusive thoughts and memories, making efforts to avoid the distressing thoughts and memories, negative beliefs about himself, and hypervigilance. [mr ismat] has likely met the full criteria for post-traumatic stress disorder since the invasion of [country j] in 2003. during the invasion, he was living in a very unsafe environment, with troops engaged in battled on the ground, aerial bombardment from coalition forces and regular bombings by insurgents. after the main fighting ended, the insurgents continued to battle coalition forces and he found [country j] to be rather lawless, with he and his family regularly threatened because they were christian. (italics added) at the time of the incident, [mr ismat] met dsm v criteria for the following: f32.20 - major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, f41.10 - generalised anxiety disorder, f43.10 - post-traumatic stress disorder. the [work] took place in the evenings and on weekends and his wife, [ms attia], began accusing him of cheating on her, which resulted in regular arguments. the arguments began to become stressful for him and, combined with the financial pressures, had a negative impact on his mood. for the first few months of 2018, [mr ismat]'s mood deteriorated further, and he began to become anxious and worried. he then developed the irrational belief that his wife was asking him about his fidelity because she was guilty about something she had done, so began to feel she must be cheating on him. this led to further arguments. by march 2017, the arguments had become quite regular and [mr ismat]'s anxiety and mood problems had worsened considerably. during an argument with [ms attia] , on april 2nd 2018, he committed the offences for which he now faces court. (italics added) on the evening of the incident, on april 2nd, 2018, there was another heated argument between [mr ismat] and his wife, with each accusing the other of infidelity. he described that, for a short time, he became angry and irrational, believing that - just as he had done in [country j] to battle the bullies who threatened him - the only way to dissuade his wife from further accusations was to scare her. upon deciding in this irrational course of action, [mr ismat] slapped his wife with an open hand and then picked up a knife to scare her. he stated, \"i love my wife and family and would never deliberately hurt her. i just wanted her to stop\". he added, \"i feel so much sorrow and remorse for what i did. i need help to make sure this never happens again.\" it would seem that due to depression, anxiety, and ptsd, [mr ismat] reverted back to a tactic that he had successfully used in [country j] to dissuade bullies from threatening him and his family. (italics added) at the time of committing the offences, [mr ismat] met the dsm v criteria for: f32.20 - major depressive disorder, single episode, severe, f41.10 - generalised anxiety disorder, f43.10 - post-traumatic stress disorder. [mr ismat]'s offences were related to a combination of his dsm v listed mental health issues that had developed while he was living in [country j]. he had somewhat recovered over the past few years, but had relapsed in the context of overwork, relationship problems, and financial difficulties. the mental health led to him engaging in behaviour that is out of context to the environment which it took place. i therefore believe that the most appropriate way of dealing with this man would be the recommended treatment plan set out in annex a. (italics added) ismat] entered into treatment of his own accord. he seems to be showing good insight into how his past trauma is affected the way he attempted to defuse the argument with his wife. he now realises that he should have simply walked away when he became angry. since the incident, [mr ismat] has also begun seeing his gp for support. the fact that he seemed to recover quite well from his ptsd until recent stressors bodes well for treatment, as it means that the triggers for his conditions are likely situational rather than predisposed. therefore, if he continues treatment with the same positive attitude, there is every reason to predict that his mood will continue to improve, his level of anxiety will reduce, and that he will learn manage his stress and hypervigilance better. when [mr ismat]'s mental health has improved, he will be more resilient in the face of future stressors and therefore much less likely to react in the way that he did. ismat] is a 40-year-old woman (sic man) with a solid work history and a long history of being a loving, caring husband and father. he developed mental health problems during his 35 years living in strife-torn [country j]. he had nearly overcome these issues, but unfortunately, over the few months leading up to the altercation with his wife, his mental health had relapsed. on the evening of the incident he was having a heated argument with his wife and retreated to behaviours that helped him survive in [country j], essentially using intimidation to in the face of the perceived threat his wife posed. the way he reacted seems to be out-of-character for the environment he was in. [mr ismat] is now receiving the care he needs to address his issues and i strongly believe [mr ismat] represents no threat to the community for the following reasons: he shows no signs of antisocial personality disorder. he has no forensic history. he has a solid work history. his history of being a loving, caring husband and father. at the time of his current crime, he was significantly impaired by his mental health. he is now in treatment and if he stays in treatment for the recommended time, it is very unlikely, given the insight he currently shows, he will ever repeat his mistakes. he seems to be genuinely remorseful for his actions toward his wife. he is motivated to continue with counselling and begin making positive changes. if [mr ismat] continues on his current path, he is on track to achieve his goals of improving his mental health, repairing his marriage, and setting a good example for his children. treatment progress [mr ismat] has remained in treatment since mid-2018. initially, the aim of the therapy was to improve mood, manage anxiety, and reduce hypervigilance and stress, which was successful. treatment then progressed towards using more advanced cognitive tools aimed at helping [mr ismat] to question long-held negative belief structures and reduce related thoughts and behaviours, such as the beliefs like \u201cthe world is a dangerous place\u201d or \u201ci need to combat anger with anger to be effective\u201d, etc. once again, therapy was successful. [mr ismat] learned strategies to better manage his mental health issues and by late 2019 he no longer met dsm v criteria for any mental health condition. he was also engaged in regular positive activities, had better sleep habits, was more social, re-established friendships and was more engaged with his social support networks. additionally, [mr ismat] also found he was much better at managing day to day stress and was no longer becoming angry. additional treatment in addition to his ongoing individual treatment, [mr ismat] completed several group programs including keeping kids in mind, keeping children safe, triple p positive parenting, and defuse men managing emotions. in completing these programs, [mr ismat] has covered topics including preventing childhood neglect, building self-esteem in children, the impact of domestic violence on children's development, managing anger, and supporting his partner. prognosis [mr ismat]'s mental health has improved and is no longer an issue. he has now developed strategies that will ensure he is able to manage his emotions much better in the future should he encounter stressful periods in his life. additionally, he has completed several programs that should ensure he possesses the skills to provide a positive environment for his children's development. (italics added) trial affidavit of the mother oral evidence of the father oral evidence of the mother dr o ismat] has attended all scheduled sessions and displayed a high level of motivation to engage. in the sessions that [mr ismat] attended, he spoke about and consolidated the learnings from the parenting, anger management and post separation courses he attended. we have also discussed strategies for how he can maintain his mental health. he has completed the following courses keeping children safe (13 weeks) commenced in september 2018 conducted by [z family centre] defuse men managing emotions completed in december 2019 \u2013 [s family centre] triple p certificate completed date 22nd november 2018 \u2013 [ab centre] keeping kinds in mind - dated march 2020 [ac centre]. [mr ismat] said that he has worked on his anger management in the defuse men managing emotions course. he felt he had been able to discuss issues in respect of his anger with other participants and also to be open to mutually supportive and challenging environment in the group. [mr ismat] acknowledged that he had been violent in his previous relationship and has developed an awareness of the triggers which caused stress in his family life. he identified a number of stressors including financial issues, jealously and lack of personal accountability. he referred to the insight he had had into taking responsibility for his anger and anger management strategies. we discussed in our sessions the importance of self-care and its connection with emotional and psychological wellbeing. we also canvassed the impact of violence, forms of power and control, equality in intimate relationships and taking responsibility for the part played in the violence cycle. he also discussed appropriate strategies for managing anger and his implementation of those strategies in his current relationships. these included responding rather than reacting, taking more time, being more mindful, respectfulness, listening and observing. [mr ismat] stated that he manages his anger differently and much more maturely in his current relationship. ismat] presented as not having any current mental health pathology. he was administered the dass and he scored in the normal range for depression, anxiety and stress. he reported that he is currently not medicated except for blood pressure and cholesterol medication. his demeanour was optimistic and his narrative positive. it is important for [mr ismat] to monitor the environmental stressors in his life as there is likely to be a correlation between increased stress and any relapse in his symptoms. the extent to which [mr ismat] will be able to maintain his current state of mental health will be contingent on a number of factors. they include his self care and attending to lifestyle issues such as sleep, diet, exercise and good work habits. it is important that he continues to remain under the monitoring of his g.p. [mr ismat] also has a number of support networks. they include caring relationships with his partner, his mother and brother with whom he lives and his sister who has been supervising the visits. [mr ismat] also stated that he has also been emotionally buoyed by the progress he has made through the court to advance his time with his children. he spoke optimistically about his relationships with his children and the quality of their interactions with each other. [mr ismat] has indicated that he plans to secure work in the near future. [mr ismat] may wish to consider ongoing monitoring on a monthly basis with a psychologist. there is a correlation between the state of a parent's mental health and their parenting capacity. it is therefore essential that [mr ismat] continues to monitor the status of his mental health and takes necessary interventions if there is a relapse in his emotional wellbeing. oral evidence of dr o would it \u2013 the things i\u2019ve related to you earlier, would that have changed the way you had approached your interviews \u2013 initial interviews with [mr ismat]?---well, i may \u2013 i may have asked him, perhaps, in \u2013 in \u2013 with \u2013 for more detail of \u2013 of what was happening for him at the time. i am aware that \u2013 that, you know, at the time, he had diagnosis that were quite co-morbid and complex which would have made him extremely emotionally and psychologically vulnerable. all right. now, you concluded, on the basis of the information you had available to you, which included the dass questionnaire, your observations of [mr ismat] and what he self-reported to you, that at the time that you prepared the report, at the time that you had been seeing him, he didn\u2019t have any outward presentations of a mental health issue. have i understood that correctly?---that\u2019s right. ... are the questions that relate to risks that flow from domestic violence in a relationship and risks that flow from mental health \u2013 are they connected, are they separate, or can they be either? ---well, i think they can be both, and, you know, often emotional dysregulation which leads to family violence can be \u2013 have very much at its \u2013 at its source, stress \u2013 excuse me, mental health concerns, post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety. often emotional dysregulation is a \u2013 is a symptom of that, and if there\u2019s an improvement in mental health, that can also often a correlation with an improvement in emotional regulation, and therefore, the likelihood of aggression, violence. so if i understand your answer, the absence of mental health issues is an indicator of less risk of emotional dysregulation or anger management issues, of violence \u2013 is that correct to say?---oh, i think there is a very strong correlation. yes, yes. all right. but is it also the case that there can be issues of emotional dysregulation, anger management issues, risks of violence, even if there aren\u2019t mental health problems, in the sense of a formally-diagnosable mental health conditions?---yes, yes. ... so for example, a person\u2019s insight into their reactions and their behaviours, and the impact that has on others \u2013 it\u2019s not necessarily something that relates to a mental health diagnosis. it can be a question of just lack of insight?---well, yes. sometimes, also to do with cultural factors, and, well, absolutely, and that\u2019s where courses such as anger management courses can be helpful to people who maybe lack insight and \u2013 into the impact of their behaviour. ... and at the beginning of the questions that were asked by the mother\u2019s counsel of you this afternoon, you were taken to, towards the bottom of that second page of your report, the bit that said: ismat] also stated that he had been emotionally buoyed by the progress he had made, through the court, to having time with his children. and you were asked about how significant that was and you said that was one factor about his mental health at the time that you had been seeing him and prepared the report. what were the other factors?---well, the other factors were that he had good lifestyle choices, that he had support of \u2013 of his family and, certainly for a time, a partner. you know, he talked about sleep, diet. he also talked about, perhaps, the possibility of finding employment. so i \u2013 and that he \u2013 he had attended courses as \u2013 as requested. so they \u2013 they were the \u2013 what i saw as protective factors on his part. ... when [mr ismat] told you that he had struggled with symptoms of mental health issues, did he particularise what symptoms he had struggled with?---well, he talked about \u2013 he talked about depression. he talked about feeling sad, angry. he talked about the feel of behavioural psycho-physical symptoms that \u2013 that would have been \u2013 i would have considered were anxiety reactions. he didn\u2019t talk a lot about what i would have thought might have been post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms, but the three are often very closely interacted \u2013 interacting. he talked a lot about depression, really, in his \u2013 in his reports to me. did he particularise what symptoms he experienced relating to depression?---sadness, anger, flatness of mood were what were \u2013 i recall him talking about. the family report look, it \u2013 i\u2019ve certainly recommended no time at all, in cases where fathers have been clearly involved in criminal activities, things like that, where i really think it would be better for the children not to see the parents. i don\u2019t think \u2013 i don\u2019t think that is the case here. and would there be a particular course, or some courses, in relation to parenting skills that you would recommend that he would do?---well, the \u2013 the pressure points in parenting usually come in managing misbehaviour, and the ones i would usually recommend for this age would either by the triple p or the 1-2-3 magic, because they both help parents to understand and deal with more difficult behaviour. i think what has been shown, and certainly what i observed, is that [mr ismat] can play with the children. there \u2013 there doesn\u2019t seem to be a \u2013 a problem there. but where he\u2019s untested, of course, is \u2013 is all the \u2013 around about bed time when children are tired, things like that. that\u2019s when children are challenging. and the two courses that you\u2019ve mentioned, the triple p parenting and the 1-2-3 magic courses, are they very similar? do they cover the same ground or ?---there \u2013 there\u2019s slightly different emphasis, yes. they\u2019re slightly different?---the \u2013 the triple p is very much behavioural. the 1-2-3 magic does try to bring in the idea of emotion coaching, which is \u2013 is a useful technique and try to get in before the difficult behaviour starts. so they\u2019re both good in their way. [mr ismat] had, again, almost five years ago completed the triple p parenting course? right. right. right. so perhaps the start now would be the 1-2-3 magic course?---2 magic, yes, is a \u2013 is a good one. but is your progression ultimately \u2013 or recommendation about progression ultimately still only at four hours each alternate weekend, which is what seems to be suggested ? right. yes. --- at paragraph 39?---yes. it\u2019s very difficult always with \u2013 with hours. i certainly felt that remaining at the four hours unsupervised was probably what [ms attia] could tolerate. but as the children grow \u2013 grow older they would possibly start asking for more time, and that might be something that [ms attia] could consider. i\u2019m not necessarily saying that it should stick at four hours forever, if that\u2019s the question. and you may or may not be able to comment on this. but are there increased risks by virtue of longer periods of time, children spending \u2013 or, these particular children spending longer periods of time with their father than shorter periods of time? because one view might be, if the father is a risk to them spending overnight time, then he\u2019s a risk spending four hours as well?---well, the sorts of things i mentioned previously, that children often become tired at night, fractious, more difficult to handle, and if someone doesn\u2019t have good control of \u2013 good emotional self-regulation, then these are the times when often things go awry. so they \u2013 that \u2013 yes, so i \u2013 i firmly believe that there is a much greater risk to \u2013 when overnight time occurs. or lengthy periods, because someone might be able to manage themselves well for a few hours. they can\u2019t necessarily manage themselves well for 48 hours. okay?---i think, at the time of the update, i was under the distinct impression that this had been down to [mr ismat], that the \u2013 that the time had not progressed. and as i say, after reading the affidavit, perhaps that is not the case. i don\u2019t know. but it would \u2013 if he had managed to adhere to all of the orders and time had gone through regularly, then i would probably recommend that ultimately some overnight time be considered, if all \u2013 all went well. yes. his honour: and can i just ask on this topic, the change of your view from possible overnight time in your first report to four hours, unsupervised, in your second report. the mother\u2019s anxiety was that not a factor or ? it \u2013 yes. it was \u2013 is that also one of the factors that you took into ?---you\u2019re \u2013 you\u2019re right. that was a factor. and the fact that the mother was still very anxious, so that that anxiety didn\u2019t seem to have lessened in the ensuring period was also a factor. mr butters: so in respect of the mother\u2019s anxiety, if her evidence is she hasn\u2019t at least, in the more recent ..... last two years, sought any therapy assistance for that anxiety, is there anything you could recommend going forward, or a service the mother could engage with, to assist with that anxiety in managing the children spending more relation time with the father? ---sure. i usually recommend the keeping contact service through [z family centre] in cases where people may struggle to follow orders. and in terms of his potential violence or violent nature the father presents with, would it lower your assessment of risk if there\u2019s no evidence of the father being violent to anyone, it appears, from the date of separation until today\u2019s date?---yes, it may. it largely would \u2013 there tends to be a pattern of violence only in intimate personal relationships, so if there have been subsequent intimate personal relationship which were free of violence, that \u2013 but i \u2013 i don\u2019t know whether we can know that. and if there was or appears to be some limited evidence of one of the father\u2019s subsequent relationships that there was no evidence that that relationship was characterised by violence, would that reduce that assessment of risk?---it may. it may. in terms of \u201cmay\u201d, what would you need to see? is there any factors you would see that would actually reduce that risk? i know it\u2019s difficult question, sorry? yes.---well, clearly, the capacity to conduct further intimate relationships without violence would \u2013 would lend some reassurance that the children, for example, wouldn\u2019t be exposed to \u2013 to further violence. and, in terms of the concern about the father undermining the mother\u2019s parenting \u2013 and accept from me the father said under oath that \u2013 or gave evidence which we summarise as he accepts and understands the importance of the mother\u2019s role, coupled with the fact he doesn\u2019t seek orders either for equal share of parental authority or to displace her as primary carer, does that give you some satisfaction that he\u2019s less likely to undermine that role?---yes. and, in terms of that satisfaction of not undermining the role, would that \u2013 if the court finds that there\u2019s no unacceptable risk at present \u2013 that the time can expand to overnight?---yes. and if you\u2019re add in to the mix \u2013 if i ask you to assume that the father, having been accused of cheating on the mother, had brandished the knife at her and intentionally, at that time, wanted to scare the mother, does that make any difference or does that assist?---i guess we all do things when we\u2019re very aroused \u2013 and i \u2013 i understand that there is a diagnosis of ptsd, which means that, really \u2013 basically means that someone\u2019s arousal levels are already high and easily become higher \u2013 that we all do things when we\u2019re aroused that we might regret. however, this is of a level of seriousness that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s concerning. whether it was \u2013 whether it was to, as you say \u2013 brandishing a knife is \u2013 is always going to be seriously concerning, yes. now, in paragraph 76 of your first report, in the last sentence you discuss overnight time possibly \u2013 you say it may be considered after a further six months of daytime contact. are you able to give an indication of what factors might lead to that being possible or not possible? ---well, the sorts of things that i would usually be looking for are very positive supervision reports, that the children are happy both to go, and positively even more importantly, when they come home that their behaviour isn\u2019t unduly disturbed, their sleeping, their eating, whatever, is not unduly disturbed. they\u2019re the sorts of things that i would look at before recommending increasing time or \u2013 or perhaps moving to overnight time. relevant legal principles the best interests of the child section 60cc considerations subsection (2a): the benefit to the child of having

[ms daffney] then kneed me in the leg. ... i took [x] to the car and buckled him in when [ms daffney] started ripping at my shirt. [ms daffney] tried to take [x] out of the car so i locked the door. i then unlocked the driver\u2019s side door, got in the car and went to my mother\u2019s. affidavit of the mother ... from february 2022, [x] began year two at a new school, [r school]. i did not inform [mr fairfield] of the change. despite this, i have seen [mr fairfield] driving his car past [x]\u2019s new school, and i see [mr fairfield] driving along the main road to the school at pick-up and drop-off. i am unsure how [mr fairfield] discovered [x] was attending his new school. i am constantly frightened that [mr fairfield] will go to [x]\u2019s school and take [x] away and i fear [mr fairfield] will follow us to discover our address. ... i have attempted to assist [x]\u2019s academic progress by reading with him and doing mathematics activities daily. however, he struggles with focus and attention and would rather play video games. i have attended parenting classes specific to [x]\u2019s age and special needs. i continue to read literature as i am determined to understand better how to support his learning and development. [mr fairfield] has never accompanied [x] to his paediatrician appointments and has little to no knowledge of his special needs. ... i do not want [mr fairfield] to be a part of our lives because i am afraid of him and how memories of his conduct and the possibility of future violent behaviour will affect the children. [mr fairfield]\u2019s behaviour has had a catastrophic effect on [d], from which i fear she will never recover. [mr fairfield]\u2019s conduct toward [d] has also significantly impacted [x]\u2019s life. [x] has sensed [d]\u2019s distress, and this negatively affects him. ... i am concerned that [mr fairfield] poses a serious risk to [x], given his propensity for physical violence and aggression, heavy drinking, risk-taking behaviours such as drunk driving, his inability to respect boundaries, and because he has been charged with sexually abusing and assaulting [x]\u2019s older sister. ... to my knowledge, [mr fairfield] does not have his own home and lives with his mother, sister, and brother in his mother\u2019s house at [suburb l]. if [x] were to stay overnight, there would be nowhere for him to sleep. [mr fairfield] and i do not have adequate communication to support equal shared parental responsibility, and we have never co-operated in caring for [x] on an ongoing basis. other than when [x] was a newborn baby, [mr fairfield] has been largely disinterested in his well-being and has had minimal involvement in his care. [mr fairfield] is unfamiliar with [x]\u2019s special needs and has never taken him to a doctor\u2019s appointment. furthermore, as detailed previously, [mr fairfield] is subject to an avo that restrains him from being within 100 metres of where [d] lives and, therefore, cannot approach our home. i am seeking sole parental responsibility for [x] and for him to continue living with me. i believe that this would be in [x]\u2019s best interests as his odd and adhd necessitate a stable routine and home environment. further, [mr fairfield] is unaware of [x]\u2019s special needs and any health issues beyond his dermatitis and has never demonstrated a capacity to maintain [x]\u2019s long-term well-being. i believe [mr fairfield] poses a danger to [x] given his heavy drinking, aggression, inability to understand and address [x]\u2019s needs, and his sexual abuse of [x]\u2019s older sister [d]. as such, i believe it is in [x]\u2019s best interests to have no contact with his father, as this is the only way to mitigate the risk of physical harm, sexual abuse and psychological harm. has made measured progress since starting kindergarten. during the weeks of remote learning there was pleasing evidence of his participation in the home learning tasks. [x] displays highly anxious behaviour which results in unsettled and defiant behaviour in class, although, usually improved throughout the day. he is reluctant to participate in learning activities and requires significant teacher support for most learning tasks. [x] is developing his social skills and strategies to assist him in dealing with a variety of social situations. he is learning to work cooperatively with others. [x] needs to be reminded to look after his belongings.by putting them back in his school bag. oral evidence of the father oral evidence of the mother affidavit and oral evidence of paternal grandmother the single expert report ... ... [ms daffney] said she felt she was \u201cwalking on eggshells\u201d as she never knew what mood [mr fairfield] would be in, or when he would \u201cexplode\u201d. she said that when they did argue, he would \u201cjust walk out\u201d rather than take steps to attempt to resolve any disagreements. however, she noted that he tended to \u201cwalk away, but after he\u2019d already blown up\u201d. according to [ms daffney], [mr fairfield] would \u201csometimes blow up at the kids as well\u201d. she said that [g] has described a time that [mr fairfield] picked him up from the car and threw them on the lounge (this is referred to in [g]\u2019s police statement, dated 12/03/2020). ... ... [ms daffney] alleged that when [mr fairfield] was [x]\u2019s primary carer, she would sometimes return home from work to find that [x] had faeces in his nappy and had not been changed all day. she said that when [mr fairfield] left the family home, she had to toilet train [x], which she thought [mr fairfield] should have done as [x]\u2019s primary carer. [ms daffney] said she was working almost every day at that point. ... [ms daffney] said that she noticed that [x] had behavioural issues when he was at day care. he was reportedly biting and doing \u201cnaughty little things\u201d. however, [ms daffney] attributed this to \u201cthe terrible twos\u201d. when he started kindergarten in 2020, however, she noticed that he had learning difficulties. [ms daffney] said that [mr fairfield] had left the family and she had more responsibility for [x]\u2019s care, whereas [mr fairfield] had previously spent more time with him. she said that she noticed it took [x] a long time to do certain tasks, he cried often, his \u201cwhinging would turn into a nightmare\u201d. she said she struggled to understand \u201cwhy it was so hard for him to do a simple thing\u201d. [ms daffney] said that she took [x] to a paediatrician and has sought support through the school. she said that [x] had a counsellor who attended his school, but during the covid lockdown this changed, and she is not sure whether this is still occurring. i asked who organised this and [ms daffney] did not know. ... according to [ms daffney], [x] has been diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd) and oppositional defiant disorder (odd), but she has not been provided with documentation confirming this. ... the subpoenaed notes from [dr f], consultant paediatrician, contain two reports (dated 11/08/2020 and 10/11/2020) which do not confirm any diagnoses for [x]. at the second appointment, on 10/11/2020, [dr f] prescribed medication for adhd, although he indicated the need for ongoing assessment in relation to adhd. at the third appointment on 5/01/2021, [dr f] noted that [x] had not been taking medication as prescribed, he had started wearing nappies to manage bedwetting, which was not recommended, and neither [ms daffney] nor [x]\u2019s teachers had completed the adhd assessment questionnaires. the remainder of the notes available refer to medication changes and note limited observed changes in [x]\u2019s behaviour. the [q school] notes contain a report by a speech pathologist, dated 27/07/2020, which indicates that [x] would benefit from some speech pathology support, but the overriding issue appeared to be anxiety. the [q school] records refer consistently to challenging behaviours by [x] in kindergarten, along with queries regarding anxiety, asd, and defiance. [ms daffney] described [x] as a \u201clost little child\u201d, becoming teary when reflecting on his range of difficulties. she noted that he has tried numerous medications to manage adhd over the past two years, but nothing has been effective. she said that he has high anxiety. ... [ms daffney] spoke positively about being a parent. she said she loves spending time with her children. she described her role as a parent as to guide and nurture her children. [ms daffney] described [d] and [g] positively. she said [d] loves dancing and working in her new job. she said [d] can be \u201ca bit of a drama queen at times, but she does have a very lovely heart, she\u2019s very considerate\u201d. she noted that despite all she has been through, she can still laugh and \u201csee the better side of the world\u201d. she described [g] as quiet on first meeting, but once he is comfortable, he is funny. she described him as thoughtful and loving, and focused on his family. [ms daffney]\u2019s description of [x] was less positive. she noted that he is \u201cquite independent\u201d, that he likes to laugh and cuddle with his family sometimes, but paused and said: \u201ci don\u2019t know how to take him at times. i don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on his head sometimes\u201d. she then spoke about the difficulties she has managing his behaviour, and reflected on him being \u201cscared of the smallest things\u201d. he reportedly wets the bed at times. my impression was that [ms daffney] feels overwhelmed at present with managing [x]\u2019s behaviour and she agreed with this assessment. it appears that [ms daffney]\u2019s focus on [x]\u2019s challenging behaviour is currently precluding her from enjoying her relationship and time with him. [ms daffney] said that she has a good bond with each of her children, although each bond is slightly different. she thinks she spends equal time with each of the children and reassures them that she loves them equally. she noted that her bond with [d] is possibly stronger than with the boys, but attributed this to [d] being older, and them having had more time together because of her age. [ms daffney] reported no involvement with dcj and she has not participated in any parenting programs. ... [ms daffney] outlined appropriate routines for the children. she noted that she has worked hard on routines with her mother and sister so that the children understand the routine and are prepared for the day. [ms daffney] said that when [mr fairfield] lived with the family, she would often have the children in bed before he got home, but that he came home late from work and woke them, so he would have to resettle them. [ms daffney] said that the children do not use devices on school days, but they can watch television after dinner. they also have dessert at times, although she said that she has had to make changes to the dessert to manage [x]\u2019s behaviour. previously, the children could have chocolate or chips, along with apple juice, cordial or coke zero. now, they can have fruit and water, although [ms daffney] tries to limit [x]\u2019s liquid intake after dinner so he does not wet the bed. she noted that she is trying to limit his sugar and sweets in the evenings due to his adhd, however, her description of his previous evening sugar intake is of concern given his young age and the associated health impacts, regardless of his mental health functioning. [ms daffney] said the boys go to bed around 9pm and [d] is normally in bed at 10pm. [ms daffney] expressed her concern that if [mr fairfield] were to have time with [x], he would negatively impact the routine she has implemented with [x]. [ms daffney] said that [mr fairfield] is important in [x]\u2019s life, as he \u201cneeds a father-figure in his life\u201d, but she is concerned that the negative impacts on [x] of having time with his father would outweigh any positive effects. [ms daffney] believes that [x] having time with his father would negatively impact [d] in particular, although she suggested that both [d] and [g] would probably ignore the fact that [x] was seeing his father. she noted that neither [d] nor [g] mention [mr fairfield], and neither does [x]. however, she added: \u201ci guess i don\u2019t ask him how he\u2019s feeling\u201d. [ms daffney] acknowledged that it is \u201cnot fair\u201d that [x] has no contact with his extended paternal family, but she added that they have not contacted her to seek time with [x]. she said if they did ask to see [x], she would have to think about this and how to manage it given that she could not take [d] and [g]. she said [x] has not asked about his extended family members, since saying that he did not want to see his paternal grandmother because she is \u201cscary\u201d. [ms daffney] said she would not trust [mr fairfield]\u2019s mother to spend unsupervised time with [x] as she worries she would take him to see [mr fairfield]. ... ... [mr fairfield] said his primary strength as a parent is that he was \u201calways there for the kids\u201d in terms of practical needs, but also offering emotional support. in terms of weaknesses, he spoke about his inability to provide financial and material stability. ... he said he typically removed privileges as discipline, or sent them to their room. [mr fairfield] said [x] was sent to his room more often than [g], but that both boys \u201cwere pretty good most of the time\u201d. he acknowledged giving [x] \u201ca light tap\u201d when he broke an expensive television, which reflected his own upbringing. [mr fairfield] acknowledged that the children had no routine when he was living with the family. he said that there was conflict between him and [ms daffney] in relation to \u201cwhich parent was going to tell the kids they had to go to bed\u201d. he added: \u201ci think we both weren\u2019t capable of yelling at the kids to go to bed\u201d. ... [mr fairfield] said that if [x] was spending time with him on weekends, they would spend time socialising and engaging in fun activities. he noted that he has not seen [x] in two years, so he would likely \u201cspoil\u201d him. he suggested an appropriate bedtime for [x] is 9:30-10pm on a weekend. ... ... [mr fairfield] suggested that [ms daffney] is a good mother overall and he has no significant concerns about her parenting. [mr fairfield] believes that [x] is being negatively impacted by his lack of contact with him, but was not sure how. ... ... ... [g] recalled positive and negative aspects of [mr fairfield], describing him as a \u201ckind of fun and sometimes yelling dad\u201d. ... summary: my impression from the interviews with the children is that there is no set routine for the children at home, that [d] assumes a parental role in relation to her younger brothers, and that [ms daffney] is currently overwhelmed and struggling to cope. overall, the bulk of information from my assessment, observations, review of documentation and collateral information suggests that [ms daffney] in fact has struggled for a long time to manage her behaviour and becomes dysregulated, resulting in verbally and physically aggressive outbursts towards the children. it appears that [mr fairfield] engaged in similarly verbally and physically aggressive conduct towards the children, although he also offered some protection and fun. ... ... ms ae (of [e mental health service]) said she is currently attempting to arrange ongoing support for [x] with a paediatrician and a child mental health service, although she had limited information about these referrals. she said she is waiting for [ms daffney] to provide signed consent to commence this process. she is also hoping to refer [ms daffney] to counselling for dv and a support group for parents of children with adhd. [ms ae] advised that her service has had no child protection concerns regarding the family. my impression, however, is that the service\u2019s engagement has been limited and likely ineffective given that [x] is a child with complex needs who is unlikely to make meaningful progress in individual sessions without parental involvement alongside a multidisciplinary treating team. a) the benefits of children having relationships with their parents is largely dependent on those parents being able to offer a meaningful and rewarding relationship to their children. this includes parents being able to prioritise their children\u2019s needs, and to support their children\u2019s developing sense of self and sense of belonging. broadly speaking, the more loving, protective adults a child has in their life, the greater their chances of developing a stable, positive sense of self, and long-term psychological health. [ms daffney] is currently overwhelmed and under-supported and she is struggling with self-regulation. ... [ms daffney] has struggled to manage [x]\u2019s challenging behaviours. despite this, [ms daffney] is [x]\u2019s primary caregiver and while i hold concerns about her parenting capacity, these are not at a level that currently outweighs the benefits of [x] having a relationship with his mother. there would be significant risks to [x] of a disruption to his relationship with his mother, particularly in terms of his psychological functioning and sense of self. it appears that [mr fairfield] has also demonstrated dysregulation in the past as a parent. the allegations of abuse of [d] suggest that [mr fairfield] has failed to prioritise [d]\u2019s needs above his own, and this raises concern that he may do the same in his relationship with [x]. while [mr fairfield] spoke appropriately about [x] and it is clear that he misses his son, i hold concern that the risks of [mr fairfield] having a relationship with [x] currently outweigh the benefits. if [x] were to have time with his father, this would create significant instability in the family home, particularly in relation to (a) [ms daffney]\u2019s capacity to manage that time and any associated behavioural changes in [x] and (b) the potential impact on [x]\u2019s relationship with his siblings. ... ... d) my views regarding the abuse allegations have been outlined in the body of this report. it is my impression that [mr fairfield] likely did sexually abuse [d]. i have conducted a risk assessment detailed above and note that while [mr fairfield] falls within a low-risk category for sexual recidivism, this does not factor in the risk of psychological harm that may be caused to the children if [x] were to have contact with his father. i am particularly concerned about the impact on the sibling relationships if [x] were to be spending time with his father. while [mr fairfield]\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of [d] is a relevant factor in this matter, it is not the sole factor that i place weight on in my determination that time with his father is currently not in [x]\u2019s best interests. e) ... i suspect that [x] would like to have a relationship with his father based solely on the information from [d] [g] and [d]. however, for this to occur, [x] and the family will require significant support and this is likely to be a long-term consideration. f) ... [x]\u2019s needs appear to be met by [d] and the other adults in the household as well as by his mother. d) my views regarding the abuse allegations have been outlined in the body of this report. it is my impression that [mr fairfield] likely did sexually abuse [d]. i have conducted a risk assessment detailed above and note that while [mr fairfield] falls within a low-risk category for sexual recidivism, this does not factor in the risk of psychological harm that may be caused to the children if [x] were to have contact with his father. i am particularly concerned about the impact on the sibling relationships if [x] were to be spending time with his father. while [mr fairfield]\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of [d] is a relevant factor in this matter, it is not the sole factor that i place weight on in my determination that time with his father is currently not in [x]\u2019s best interests. e) ... i suspect that [x] would like to have a relationship with his father based solely on the information from [d] [g] and [d]. however, for this to occur, [x] and the family will require significant support and this is likely to be a long-term consideration. f) ...

[x]\u2019s needs appear to be met by [d] and the other adults in the household as well as by his mother. the sibling relationship is of particular importance in this matter. both [g] and [x] view [mr fairfield] as their father. [d] has viewed him as a father-figure. both [mr fairfield] and [ms daffney] have been inconsistent in their parenting capacity, and it is likely that [d] [d]has offered significant stability to [x] since his birth, and to [g] as well. it is my view that the sibling relationship should be prioritised in this matter in order to support the children\u2019s positive emotional connection with each other, which will provide them with a sense of belonging and associated positive psychological impacts. ... g) [x] has complex needs and while all children require stability and consistency, this is even more important for [x]. a change in his circumstances including separation from his mother would exacerbate his current challenging behaviours and decrease his psychological functioning. a change that included spending time with his father would have significant negative short- and medium-term negative impacts given that his mother does not currently present as able to manage his behaviours. if [x] were to have time with his father, it is expected that his challenging behaviours would become heightened for a period while he experienced a repeated attachment stress in relation to both of his parents. his mother would require a high level of competence in dealing with [x]\u2019s behaviours to support him to cope with such stress. [ms daffney] does not have this capacity at present and given [x]\u2019s vulnerabilities, it is not in his best interests to expose him to such increased instability at present. furthermore, a change of his circumstances to include time with his father would likely impact both [g] and [d], and place additional demands on [ms daffney]\u2019s limited resources, as well as potentially negatively impacting the relationship between [x] and his siblings. again, this would require a high level of competency from [ms daffney] to manage any ruptures to the sibling relationship, and she does not currently have this capacity. h) [x] has complex needs that remain unsupported, despite his schools highlighting the need for appropriate therapeutic support since he commenced kindergarten in 2020. [mr fairfield] has not been exposed to the extent of [x]\u2019s challenging behaviours and so has limited insight into his needs. [ms daffney] presents with limited capacity to obtain and maintain appropriate support for x. she has not accessed the support offered by the school. she presents as ineffectual in managing this issue and would benefit from casework support in this regard. ideally, dcj would become involved with the family and link them into appropriate supports. i will make recommendations regarding this below. there are no specific cultural considerations in this matter, the more pressing issue is [x]\u2019s psychological functioning and high needs. j) ... [ms daffney] is currently overwhelmed and unable to meet [x]\u2019s needs. her sense of overwhelm appears to be negatively impacting her view of [x] broadly speaking, and as such, she is currently demonstrating a negative attitude towards parenting and the responsibilities of parenthood, particularly as they relate to [x]. k) i hold concerns about (a) the parents\u2019 capacity to communicate respectfully with each other, (b) their capacity to manage their own conduct towards each other and protect the children from this, and (c) the behavioural impacts that spending time with his father would have on [x], and [ms daffney]\u2019s capacity to meet the increased demands this would place on her. regardless of how well [mr fairfield] were to manage his time with [x], [x] would likely experience strong emotions in response to seeing his father, and his current behavioural difficulties mean that he has limited resources to manage himself. he would likely demonstrate an increase in dysregulated behaviour in response to either positive or negative emotions. this would impact not only [ms daffney], but also [d] and [g], and i suspect would destabilise the family to a point that all three children would be at risk of psychological harm. my impression is that both parents struggle with appropriate self- regulation, which impacts their parenting capacity. m) [x] has significant emotional, developmental and mental health issues that require addressing. as yet, these have not been appropriately assessed and diagnosed. there are queries in relation to adhd, asd, odd, anxiety, and potentially a developmental or cognitive delay.

[ms daffney] proposes that [x] spends no time with [mr fairfield]. giving consideration to (a) both parents\u2019 dysregulation and periods of limited parenting capacity, (b) [mr fairfield]\u2019s alleged sexual abuse of [d], which i consider likely occurred, and (c) the destabilisation that time with his father would create for [x] and his mother and maternal siblings, it is my view at this point that [ms daffney]\u2019s proposal is more likely in [x]\u2019s best interests. ... his honour: right. but if you assume that if you take out of the equation \u2013 in terms of your reasoning you take out of the equationing that the father, in your words, was likely to have sexually touched [d], if you take that out, do your recommendations remain the same? they would, because even if i take out my position or my \u2013 my suspicion that the father likely sexually abused [d], i\u2019m left with the understanding that [d] believes that he sexually abused her and that the mother also has that position, so the psychological impacts are the same even if the risk issues are reduced. so in terms of as far as you can predict, what sort of behaviours would you be concerned about for [x] if his honour were to make orders like the ones that the father seeks?---i think that the process of transitioning between two homes, both of which i hold concerns about the capacity for stable routine, would be problematic for [x]. [x] is a child who really needs a high level of stability and consistency and i think that \u2013 between those homes i don\u2019t have confidence that the parents would be able to essentially be on the same page in terms of management strategies, emotional support strategies, supporting [x] to engage in emotional self-regulation himself, and that that would create significant confusion for [x] which would then lead to behavioural, you know, outbursts, meltdowns, tantrums, that \u2013 an increase in that oppositional behaviour that both his mother and the school were reporting. and i think that at the moment, acknowledging that [ms daffney] has said she has made some improvements in terms of her capacity to engage in positive management strategies, i\u2019m concerned that with the high level of emotion that would come there that those \u2013 that her capacity would reduce, and that\u2019s the household word. [x] would be spending the majority of her time in both of the proposals \u2013 sorry \u2013 of his time in both of the proposals.....for both children as well i think that if they were missing [mr fairfield], which i suspect that they are, that that would lead to increased distress for them... and, again, those behavioural \u2013 the behavioural expression of those emotional experiences i think is something that [ms daffney] would find quite difficult to deal with. and in terms of those potential behavioural changes in [x] and/or [d]and [g], are those sorts of behavioural difficulties the type of thing that\u2019s likely to sort of blow up and then resolve very quickly, or are they things that are unlikely to be problematic over an extended period of time?---i think that the nature of the behaviours that we\u2019re looking at are things that are likely to be extended, particularly with [x]\u2019s particular vulnerabilities, the fact that he, to my understanding, is still not engaged \u2013 still doesn\u2019t have a comprehensive diagnosis and treatment plan. it doesn\u2019t sound that there\u2019s a solid support team around him as yet, so we\u2019re looking at sort of vulnerabilities on top of vulnerabilities. and it\u2019s the same again for [d] and whether she has got a history of self-harming behaviour. yes? i\u2019m concerned about a resurgence in that, particularly while she has not engaged in counselling, and i\u2019m concerned about her capacity \u2013 not her capacity, but her willingness to re-engage in counselling, despite a recognition that she would benefit from that, so i think that without access to appropriate supports and even with access to appropriate supports these are behaviours that could potentially persist for quite some time. ---it does exacerbate my concern. as i was speaking before in terms of the differences then between the homes, if we take an assumption that [ms daffney] is engaged in a process of attempting to learn appropriate management strategies and routines and apply greater consistency and stability in her home for [x], if these things are not then matched in the home with the father, that creates, i think, significant instability for [x], as i was saying before. but if the father is not willing to engage in a process around that, then that exacerbates those concerns that i hold.....but at the same time my report has been available i think the concerns in my report have been quite clear, and it\u2019s of some concern to me that he\u2019s now saying that he hasn\u2019t taken any steps to understand some of the difficulties that [x] is presenting with. and what is \u2013 when you said you could talk generally as to adhd, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, can you explain what your understanding is of that condition?---so it is a condition that typically emerges in children. it\u2019s quite common to see that emerge at the point that a child commences kindergarten and those early years of school as the demands on the child are increased, so it creates disruptions in terms of a child\u2019s capacity to focus, to pay attention, and so that is across a whole range of areas. so children with adhd will have difficulty in focussing in the classroom environment, in the home environment. they may have some areas that they\u2019re able to focus on particular areas of interest, but not the same way that children without adhd are able to sit and focus on something that really interests them. so there\u2019s the issue in terms of that, the concentration and focus, and then there are also issues in terms of hyperactive behaviour. so children might present as quite fidgety, moving quickly from one thing to the next. we see the same thing in terms of their conversation. they sort of jump about, you know, the things that don\u2019t seem quite connected, but their \u2013 their brains are moving quite quickly and they move between different topics of discussion the same way that they will move around, you know, within a room. ... and odd, oppositional defiance disorder, do you know anything of that condition?---oppositional defiance disorder is one that we commonly see in conjunction with adhd, so there can be crossover. part of that is just due to similarity in some of the presentations. the children with oppositional defiance disorder will have difficulty in following instructions, they can be quite aggressive and engage in behavioural outbursts and, again, these are conditions that are behaviours that are seen across a different \u2013 different context, so not only in the home, not only at school, but across different contexts. yes?---there is quite a bit of crossover in terms of the behavioural symptoms that we see for adhd, odd, as well as anxiety and trauma, so it can be quite difficult to get a conclusive diagnosis between those conditions, which is why it\u2019s really important to have somebody with a high level of expertise conducting the assessment. and in terms of what you\u2019ve just raised there about possibly [x] missing his father as contributing to those behaviours, notwithstanding that, does it remain the case that on the balance of what we should be doing in [x]\u2019s best interests, him missing his father needs to be put aside in preference for stabilising him?---unfortunately it does in this case because we\u2019re talking about quite a complex psychological process for a child, and i don\u2019t have confidence that either of the parents have got the capacity to manage some of the nuances required around supporting [x] at this point in time. and do you agree with me that there\u2019s a complicating factor there in terms of the parents having very limited ability to co-parent, which would just exacerbate their own deficits in that area? yes, that\u2019s right. his honour: well, just on that point, if you assume the child did say that to the father three years ago, \u201ci want to go with you,\u201d considering all the material that you\u2019ve had before you, would the fact that the child didn\u2019t go with the father at that time or hasn\u2019t seen him for three years, explain all his behavioural issues that you\u2019re aware the \u2013 or explain the extent of the behavioural issues that you understand he has experienced both at home and in the school environment over the last three years?---no, it would not. yes?---it\u2019s certainly a possible contributor and it\u2019s something that i was aware of at the time of preparing my report and that i believe i referenced in my report. i believe and i accept that [x] likely does miss his dad and that that is possibly contributing, but i don\u2019t believe it explains the extent of the difficulties for [x]. and if this behaviour of [x] which has continued now for three years is to continue in the future, what effect could that have on his welfare?---as i said before, i think that his behaviour is likely having significant impacts on his academic, his social, psychological and behavioural functioning. it will impact his ability to engage at school, to learn, to keep up academically with his peers. also, behaviourally in terms of his peers. children who engage in a range of externalising behaviour such as [x] is, or is reported to be, can find it difficult to make friends, and that was certainly the information that i was provided by the school at the time that i spoke with them that he has difficulty connecting with his friends. there are associated psychological impacts from that in terms of low self-worth, you know, for a child who\u2019s not keeping up academically and socially. you know, he needs quite a bit of support in terms of learning to effectively manage his emotions as well as his behaviours, and without receiving that support he\u2019s likely to continue engaging in these behaviours which could have a whole range of negative outcomes for him. ---i contemplated the issue of supervised time and where that would work, where that would fit. i think that this \u2013 there are similar concerns for me in terms of the psychological impacts for \u2013 for [x] as well as for [d] and [g] and the instability that that would create within the home and within the sibling relationship which i think needs to be prioritised, acknowledging of course that [x] does not have contact with [h]. i also think that the issue around supervised time is not necessarily a viable long-term option and that there are costs associated with it that i would be quite difficult for the family to meet on a long-term basis. so yes, i think that supervised time would \u2013 would manage some issues but certainly not all of them and not to the point that it would remove my concern about the other risks that would arise. but it may well be, based on the evidence of [x]\u2019s behavioural interactions, that he will open up with his father and be content \u2013 more content with life, mightn\u2019t it?---in my report i raise concerns about both parents\u2019 parenting capacity and the ability of both parents to meet the complex needs that [x] presents with. in a best case scenario where a parent is able to attune to their child, to recognise their child\u2019s emotional needs, to be able to provide emotional coaching and some coregulation and teach those self-regulation skills, then yes, that would lead to a reduction in the psychological and behavioural symptoms that a child might be exhibiting. i don\u2019t have confidence in either parents\u2019 ability to be able to do that for [x]. yes, but if the father\u2019s time is limited to some quality day time doing some activities, for instance, they used to take [x] fishing. do you understand that?---i do. things might \u2013 that could well be very beneficial to [x], couldn\u2019t it?---i think that [x] would very much enjoy that, but i think that he would have difficulty then managing that experience, then saying goodbye to his father understanding that he might not see his father again for some time, coming home and having a brother and sister who are upset with the implications of that, and having a mother who is not able to necessarily deal with the complexities of the psychological needs of three children that that arises. there could be an order made though by the court requiring some continuing therapeutic intervention, couldn\u2019t there be?---there absolutely could be, but there are no services that are available currently that will provide such an intervention free of charge or for minimal cost. relevant legal principles the best interests of the child section 60cc considerations subsection (2a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents: a primary consideration subsection (2b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. there is a significant risk that the father would be unable to adequately manage the child\u2019s behavioural difficulties including oppositional behaviour. there is a significant risk that the father would use excessive physical discipline and/or verbal abuse including yelling in managing the child\u2019s behavioural difficulties. the child exhibits symptoms and challenging behaviour consistent with attention deficit hyperactive disorder (adhd), oppositional defiance disorder (odd) and anxiety. these symptoms have been exhibited by the child, inter alia, in the home environment of the mother. the father has no understanding of these disorders including their associated symptoms, with the court observing that he has not been exposed to the child\u2019s challenging behaviours and so has limited insight into his needs, (whilst the court recognises that it is possible that the father could, in due course, educate himself in relation to these matters). the child experiences inter alia bed-wetting, and sleep issues. the father exhibited dysregulated and adverse behaviour during the parties\u2019 relationship, for example, by yelling at the child when the child misbehaved, and biting d, then a child of 12 years, (albeit after d had slapped the father during a wrestling game) and the father has as yet taken no steps to personally address and rehabilitate himself in these respects. the single expert report writer had stated that the father struggled with appropriate self-regulation which impacted his parenting capacity. there is a significant risk that the mother would be unable to adequately manage parenting the child on the child\u2019s return to her household from having spent time with the father. the mother\u2019s present capacity to manage the child\u2019s behaviours (who has special and high needs) is presently significantly limited by reason of, inter alia, her own dysregulated behaviour when caring for the child (the single expert report writer had stated that the mother struggled with appropriate self-regulation which impacted her parenting capacity), her present lack of education in relation to parenting skills for a child displaying symptoms of adhd and odd, her failure to fully access school support and health professional support for the child\u2019s special needs, the parenting demands placed upon her by d\u2019s own needs, and the mother\u2019s needs to financially support her family. the mother has struggled post separation in adequately parenting the child by reason of the child\u2019s special and high needs. in this context, the court notes that over about the past six months the mother has acquired some skills in disciplining the child (e.g. not yelling or arguing with the child, and giving the child options in the context of misbehaviour and complying with household rules) but such acquisition of skills and related health professional support is presently far from complete. the single expert report writer had stated that the child has significant emotional, developmental and mental health issues that require addressing, and as yet these have not been appropriately assessed and diagnosed. she stated that there are queries in relation to adhd, asd, odd, anxiety, and potentially a developmental or cognitive delay. she stated that the child requires immediate referral to a paediatrician for diagnostic clarification and a treatment plan, which may include medication, psychological intervention, parenting intervention for the mother, and holistic family intervention. as explained by the single expert report writer, if the child were to have time with the father, on his return to the mother\u2019s household it is expected that his challenging behaviours would become heightened for a period while he experienced a repeated attachment stress in relation to both of his parents. the single expert report writer had stated that the child would likely experience strong emotions in response to seeing the father, and his current behavioural difficulties mean that he has limited resources to manage himself, he would likely demonstrate an increase in dysregulated behaviour in response to either positive or negative emotions. the mother would require a higher level of competence in dealing with the child\u2019s heightened behaviours to support him to cope with such stress including strong emotions, however, the mother\u2019s parenting capacity at present is inadequate in this regard. in these circumstances there is a significant risk the child would experience emotional harm together with adverse emotional impacts upon d and g, with resultant destabilisation of the mother\u2019s family unit. the child and g view the father as their father. d has viewed the father as a father figure. there is a significant risk that d, believing as she does that the father inappropriately sexually touched her, and observing that she has previously assisted the mother in meeting the needs of the child (and g), would experience adverse emotional reactions in relation to the child spending time with the father. such adverse reactions may adversely affect the child\u2019s relationship with d, and may adversely affect d assisting the mother in meeting the needs of the child (and g). and further, g may well react adversely to the child spending time with the father and the child\u2019s relationship with g could thereby be adversely affected. with such outcomes, additional demands would be placed on the mother\u2019s present limited parenting capacity (e.g. such demands as the need to manage any ruptures to the child\u2019s relationship with g and d) which she would be unable to meet, with resultant negative impacts upon the child\u2019s emotional state. by reason of the above matters, should the child spend time with the father, the child\u2019s present stability and consistency would be adversely affected with the significant risk of an exacerbation of his current challenging behaviours and decrease in his psychological functioning. in the face of the complexities of this family, father and mother and household, you\u2019ve suggested that \u2013 well, it has been suggested to you that there could be some therapy, some counselling, and you\u2019ve given evidence just a few minutes ago that it would be unaffordable. but what sort of therapy would be needed in order to address the complex issues that face this family in the mother\u2019s household?---in order for [x] to be able to spend time with his father and for there not to be the \u2013 not \u2013 for the risks that i\u2019ve articulated to not come to fruition, or to be able to be managed appropriately, we would be talking about a fairly intensive family therapeutic support process whereby [x]\u2019s vulnerabilities were able to be identified, that there would be some diagnostic clarity in terms of what the actual issues are, and that would help in terms of identifying the issue that was previously explored in terms of is medication appropriate or not. that would then give us a guideline in terms of what is needed to help [x] just currently be able to deal on a day to day basis, to offer some guidance for his mother to be able to support him around that. and then once that process \u2013 once things had stabilised as much as they could in relation to that process, then it would be looking at either jointly or after a period of time looking at therapeutic support for [d] and [g] as well to explore their relationship with [mr fairfield] to be able to offer them an opportunity to identify what their hopes and wishes are for a relationship with him. there would be a process whereby [ms daffney] would also engage in a therapeutic process to be able to understand her children\u2019s complex psychological needs, to be able to manage with the competing different needs that each of the children may present with at different points. there would likely be some joint work that would occur between [ms daffney] and the three children because one of the primary goals would be around stabilising those relationships before [mr fairfield] could then be brought back into the picture. so if everything went along swimmingly, everyone was able to engage, things went well, the relationship between [ms daffney] and the children was stable and strong and she was able to deal with all of the things that life throws \u2013 throws up in the course of daily living, then consideration will be brought to bringing [mr fairfield] into that process. now, he would also have needed to undergone a process himself beforehand of understanding the children\u2019s needs in terms of the vulnerabilities that [x] particularly presents with and what response is needed in relation to those, but also understanding the psychological impacts for [x], for [d] and for [g] around the separation process, the allegations, the previous criminal proceedings, [d]\u2019s current belief that he sexually abused her and how he\u2019s able to respond to that in a way that\u2019s helpful for her. if he was able to do that, then we would look at bringing everybody together and starting a therapeutic process of reconnection which might involve the children having sessions with him where they could discuss that, where they could look at things they might need to be able to strengthen the relationship and feel safe within that relationship. and i will note that [d] and [g] both spoke to me about points of not feeling safe with [mr fairfield], so there \u2013 there are significant complex considerations i would be \u2013 we would be talking about weekly therapeutic sessions in some variation of individual/group. we would be talking about a number of clinicians needing to be involved, and that could take a process of years to be able to do that in a safe and structured, supported way. and that\u2019s just not realistic, is it? not currently unfortunately.

[a limitation as to the period the property is to be listed, or a mechanism for the sale price to be reduced to be agreed]. 5.3. upon the sale the brothers are to distribute 50 per cent of the net sale proceeds to the wife, excluding cgt for which the husband will remain liable. wife proposes a different basis for settlement: putting aside, for a moment, the issue of the sale, there would appear to be distinct advantages to your client and [mr d] in transferring the [town e] property to our client pursuant to consent orders - i.e. the avoidance of sale costs, cgt and capitalising on what your client appears to regard as an inflated valuation. as such, we would propose a settlement whereby: your client transfer to our client the balance of the net sale proceeds of [suburb j] held in trust, together with the balance of the cba account [...]61 (already agreed). your client and [mr d] cause the transfer of property and in so doing: 2.1 your client attend to discharging his half share of the joint cba mortgage, 2.2 our client pay [mr d] $325,000, from which he would effect the discharge of his half-share of the joint cba mortgage, 2.3 your client pay [mr d] $200,000 on whatever terms the brothers believe are suitable in the circumstances. ... we are instructed our client remains willing for your client to acquire the [town l] property for $1.05 million and we understand his brother is agreeable to this also but the $200,000 payment to your client remains our client\u2019s obligation... we are instructed to give your client until 4.00pm friday 1 july 2022 to decide whether she wishes to purchase the property at the price of $1,050,000. if not the property will then be placed on the market for sale at a price of $1,099,000. should this occur our client will instruct the agent to excluded [sic] the wife for the purposes of the agent\u2019s commission such that there will be no commission payable in the event the property is sold to the wife. our client is content to accept your client\u2019s proposal subject to: the transfer occurring pursuant to orders as follows: 1.1 the husband and [mr d] transfer their interest in the property to our client and discharge the mortgage secured over it, and ich is again effectively a repetition of the wife\u2019s earlier proposal in the letter of 27 june) 1.2 our client pay [mr d] $525,000. my interpretation of the consent order: the husband submits his only obligation with respect to the mortgage pursuant to order 5 was to remove the encumbrance. in other words, he is not obligated to meet the $140,885.88 share of loans which it secured. this is more than mere semantics because a \u201cmortgage\u201d is defined in section 3 of the real property act as \u201cany charge on land (other than a covenant charge) created merely for securing the payment of a debt\u201d. the husband does not dispute a registered mortgagee will insist on the settlement of a debt secured by a mortgage before releasing the security and the husband does not submit that the security could have been released without the loans having been settled. but in the context of the factual matrix in this case the husband submits that consistent with the heads of agreement and the exchange of correspondence that the obligation for the settlement of the husband\u2019s share of the loans fell to the wife. the husband and his brother were the only persons with legal authority to do what was required to legally discharge the mortgage, i.e. the charge on the land. the orders are silent as to who is responsible for the settlement of the loans to cba, but in light of the heads of agreement and consistent with section 3 of the real property act 1900 (nsw) the only reasonable conclusion to be drawn is that the wife was to meet the husband\u2019s share of that, namely $140,885.88. d in that regard he refers to a specific \u201cvendor destination line\u201d in the conveyancing transaction relating to the town e property.) a party who has entered into a written contract under a serious mistake about its contents in relation to a fundamental term will be entitled in equity to an order rescinding the contract if the other party is aware that circumstances exist which indicate that the first party is entering the contract under some serious mistake or misapprehension about either the content or subject matter of that term and deliberately sets out to ensure that the first party does not become aware of the existence of his mistake or misapprehension. conclusion & orders: associate: dated: 10 may 2023 dated: 10 may 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "938.txt", "size": 9318, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 9411, "document_id": "938"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "938_chunk_0"}}

give the children the benefit of a meaningful relationship with each of their parents.[1] these children are not at risk from either of their parents, in the sense set out in the legislation.[2] risk to these children arises from their parents\u2019 inability to communicate effectively at times, and the lack of trust between them. 8 the children need their parents to work together in their interests. the parents need assistance to achieve that. it is clear from the observations of the report writer that the children have a close relationship with each of their parents.[3] there is nothing in the evidence that supports it being in the children\u2019s interests for time with the father to not exceed one night each week during school terms, as the mother proposes. nor is there anything to suggest that the children could not manage spending half the school holidays with each of their parents, once y is a little older. 9 the father seeks that the endpoint of time arrangements be an equal time arrangement. such arrangements work best, as the report writer noted, when parties are able to be flexible and cooperative with each other. i would add when each parent trusts the others\u2019 parenting capacity and decision making ability. the parents do not have that kind of relationship at the present time. it is clear on the evidence that neither trusts the other. 10 these children have diverse and rich cultural backgrounds from their mother\u2019s country b background, to their father\u2019s anglo-australian background.[4] they are growing up as bilingual children, which i accept is in their best interests. this will promote their connection to both their families of origin, and enable them to communicate with their extended maternal family. 11 the mother has no issue with the father taking the children to church services from time to time. religion is not a major issue for either party. 12 the father has suggested that the children lead an isolated life with their mother, without a great deal of social contact. this hearing began on the first day of new south wales emerging from a lockdown of some 16 weeks. prior to that there have been restrictions at different times since march 2020. it is difficult to assess the father\u2019s concerns within that context. it would appear that in the mother\u2019s care, the children are engaged in a range of activities: they play in the park with friends, and their dog, x participates in sports, they know people within their local community. x attends a local public school, and y a local pre-school. they have been invited to friends\u2019 birthday parties, and had friends to play at home. there is no evidence upon which i could find that the children are socially isolated when with the mother. 13 the mother\u2019s attitude towards learning and education is perhaps more rigid than the father. she and her parents were observed by the report writer to focus on meeting the children\u2019s needs: \u201cat times this seems to involve a somewhat intense focus on aspects of their day-to-day care and routines\u201d. this accords with the mother\u2019s oral evidence. 14 the parties each have different attitudes towards the responsibilities and duties of parenthood. the mother is critical of the father\u2019s parenting capacity. in her view the father is able to play with them, but she is not confident that he is able to attend to other needs such as engaging in homework, teaching the children, and managing their day to day lives. as the report writer noted children learn many things through play, including sharing. it is valuable for a child\u2019s development. there is nothing in the evidence that the supports the father\u2019s incapacity to meet the children\u2019s needs. he has done so in the time he has spent with them. 15 it is clear from the material that the mother is particular about hygiene and cleanliness. an example of this is that, prior to x\u2019s birth, she purchased a washing machine to use solely for x\u2019s clothing. she used a different washing machine for all the other household washing. on her evidence she continues to wash the children\u2019s clothing in a separate machine. 16 the father does not share the mother\u2019s views about those matters. this difference with respect to matters of cleanliness and hygiene has been a source of conflict between them. this has included matters such as the return of swimming costumes mixed with other clothing. there is nothing adverse for the children in either of the parties\u2019 approaches. their approaches are simply different, and reflect their different backgrounds and outlooks. the parents need to respect the different approaches of the other. these are matters that go more to trust between the parents, than to issues of parental competency. 17 i accept that the different views of the parties have caused friction between them. the referral of the parties to the keeping in contact programme is in part to address issues, and to assist their communication. 18 i do not accept that an equal time arrangement for the children is sustainable given the parties\u2019 relationship, and attitude to each other. the children need to be able to develop a secure relationship with their father through regular overnight time with him. i accept that this should happen in a graduated manner, particularly taking into account y\u2019s developmental needs and ability to sustain separation form his primary carer. he will start school in 2023. 19 the children are used to a routine of seeing their father each week. the orders i propose making build on that arrangement until block periods of 4 nights each fortnight commence in term 2 2023. this is to give y an opportunity to settle into school before longer, fortnightly periods commence. blocks of time mean that both the children and the parents do not need to manage too many changeovers. this minimises the possibility of homework, and things they need for school, being left in the other home. it is intended to minimise the potential for the children to be exposed to conflict between their parents. the extent to which either parent has engaged in family violence, and the extent to which that would impact the parent\u2019s ability to share parental responsibility 20 the parties have engaged in poor behaviour with each other. this have had disputes over, for example, the use of a blanket. when the children were little and co-sleeping, the mother used a particular blanket as a buffer to stop the child falling out of the bed, or being rolled on by an adult. on an occasion the father was leaving the bed to sleep elsewhere, he tried to take the blanket. the mother did not agree. this dispute led to pushing and shoving between the parents over the blanket, and ended with the mother being pushed against a wall by the father. this was done with sufficient force to cause a crack in the wall. this was unacceptable behaviour. 21 as was clear from their evidence, each parent regards the other as being at fault on this occasion. i find that each participated in the dispute. i note that it occurred at night, when the father was leaving the bed to sleep on the couch. the children were in bed with the parties. he wanted to take the blanket to use on the couch. neither party were prepared to give way, which led to a tug of war. each agreed there was no shortage of bedding that could be used. each regarded the other as at fault. neither were prepared to concede their role in the dispute, nor displayed insight into their conduct. 22 i do not find that the mother was subjected to family violence by the father. i find that both parents engaged in argumentative and disrespectful behaviour. the mother was clear that she is not frightened of the father. there have been no incidents of any type of family violence following separation. 23 both parents need to have regard to their behaviour, and the inappropriateness of it. fortunately it has not been repeated between them following separation. 24 the mother raises a concern that as the children grow older, they may have disagreements with the father which could lead to him responding in a physical manner towards them. the father has previously slapped the mother during the course of an argument. his evidence is that she slapped him back harder. the mother denies doing that. i do not find this incident significant for the father\u2019s care of the children. theirs was not a relationship marred by family violence.[5] their disputes are more about their incapacity to agree and deal calmly with each other. this causes verbal disputes to escalate, with neither prepared to give ground. 25 in my view, both parents would be assisted by participating in a program that assists their communication with each other, and developing an understanding and respect for the strengths of the other as a parent. the report writer considered anger management courses as not terribly effective, and that a men\u2019s behavioural change course would be unlikely to accept the father based on his conduct. she regarded a programme such as keeping contact as appropriate. 26 there has been some recent improvement in the parties\u2019 capacity to communicate, and make arrangements to vary orders between them. the use of an app such as myfamilywizard or 2homes has been identified by the report writer as perhaps benefiting the parties. it would be helpful that they have a calendar they can utilise for the children, so that each is aware of appointments scheduled for things like speech therapy and other matters. 27 it would also be helpful for these children not to be exposed to dispute between their parents, and the potential for conflict. i accept that once both children are at school, the potential for disputation between them increases, as the children\u2019s lives become more complicated. there is the movement of a number of items between parents\u2019 households, with which the children may need assistance. one would expect for these children that would include things like musical instruments, sporting equipment, homework, consent forms for excursions, and school projects. 28 the use of school to collect and return children can provide children with an important buffer in moving from one household to another. they do not have to instantly manage the shift between households with different rules and expectations. they do not need to deal with tension between their parents, the two most important people in their lives. i find this would be of assistance to x and y, particularly once y commences at school. at the present time, the mother delivers y to the father outside x\u2019s school from day care. it would be helpful for the father to collect both children from their school and day care, and return them to school and day care. it allows the children to settle into time with each of them, and be confident that their parent can manage those situations for them. 29 the mother is clearly a competent and caring parent. she does, however, have a lack of regard for the father\u2019s capacity as a parent. it would be helpful if she can appreciate the benefits that the children have from their relationship with their father. the father needs to grow in his understanding and respect of the mother\u2019s views on parenting. increasing respect for each other is likely to minimise conflict. 30 the parties\u2019 dispute over celebrating x\u2019s birthday exemplifies some of these matters. the father wanted to swap afternoons, so the children were with him from after school to 7pm on her birthday. the mother did not regard this as giving her time with the children on x\u2019s birthday, although they were waking up in her home. she proposed dividing the afternoon time, as she did not regard the morning before school as significant. the father proposed that he collect them from the mother at 5pm, and have them overnight as a compromise. in cross examination the mother was clearly upset by the father\u2019s proposal, referring to it as \u201cunfair\u201d. when asked unfair to whom, she was clear: unfair to her. this was not about what the children might prefer, or what might work for them. i accept that this is indicative of her view that the father\u2019s role in the children\u2019s lives is not as significant as hers. 31 as the report writer has noted, conflict is the factor that will cause problems for these children. neither party seem to have addressed or really considered that as being an issue. time with the children and their father culminating in four nights each fortnight, will ensure their security in their relationship with their father. it also has the benefit of not challenging the mother to such an extent that she cannot fully support their relationship with the father. 32 orders that provide for time to gradually increase to two nights, then to three nights, culminating in four nights and half school holidays i find are in the interests of these children. as y settles into school, an arrangement that moves to one longer weekend with the father rather than a back and forth should minimise the potential for conflict between these parents. what, if any, restraints should exist on overseas travel for the children to china 33 country b is not a signatory to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction (\u201chague convention\u201d). the father has raised a concern that were she to travel to country b she may not return the children, without providing a security. he also regards this as being a greater risk when the children are younger. the mother argues that she has made her life in australia, has studied in australia since she was 19, owns has an interest in three properties in australia, and has no intention of returning to live in country b. she became an australian citizen in 2010. on her unchallenged evidence this required her to relinquish her country b citizenship, so that she requires a visa for travel to country b. 34 the maternal grandparents have permanent residency status in australia, which they obtained in 2011. the maternal grandfather has returned to country b in 2021 to care for his elderly and unwell mother. the mother would like the children to take the children for holidays to country b, as she did during the marriage. she anticipates doing that in the june school holidays. she wants the children to see their grandmother, whose age and health does not permit travel to australia. engagement with their extended family is important for the children. they should be able to do so in country b. 35 i accept that the wife is committed to residing in australia. she is supported in this by her parents. she has made a settled life here, including investing in property. she is prepared to put up $100,000 as security for the return of the children to australia. the husband agreed during the course of the hearing that was an adequate amount, rather than the $200,000 initially contended. the husband additionally sought a restraint on travel prior to 2023. i do not regard that as necessary to ensure the children\u2019s return to australia, and do not propose restraining travel. there may be health issues in the mother\u2019s family that require travel earlier than that, and i do not propose inhibiting that. parental responsibility 36 as is clear from the findings with respect to family violence, i do not regard the allegations made by the mother as a basis for disturbing the presumption that there should be an order for equal shared parental responsibility. the orders will provide for significant and substantial time between the children and their father. 37 the parties are both educated people. the mother is dubious that the father is invested in the children\u2019s education, as she sees him as only playing with the children rather than involving himself in more formal aspects of x\u2019s education. play for children the age of these children is very important. the children learn important skills of sharing, negotiation, problem solving, and other matters. that the father has not promoted educational activities as much as the mother, does not mean he is not interested in their education. i find that he is. both parents have involved themselves in x\u2019s reading homework for school. both parents support x learning to play an instrument, and encourage her to practise. 38 the example of potential conflict over, for example, tutoring prior to selective high school examinations was raised. firstly, that is not an issue of parental responsibility. secondly, parents need to resolve which activities children engage in when it occurs during time the children spend with each of their parents. if it is not agreed, extra-curricular activities can happen only when with the parent promoting the activity, or not at all. having heard the evidence of both parents, i do not doubt that they are both committed to their children receiving a good education, and having access to a range of opportunities through extra-curricular activities. 39 the mother raised in her orders, although there is scant evidence about it, an issue of treatment for a \u201clazy eye\u201d for y. on medical advice they have used an eye patch to assist him. it is unclear on the evidence to what extent the problem is resolved. the mother is concerned that the father may seek a surgical option for treatment, which she does not presently favour. 40 the evidence supports that both parents seek medical assistance for the children, and act reasonably with respect to advice given. as was raised with the parties during submissions, orders requiring the parties to take the children to the same medical practice would assist. they can both build a relationship with the gp, as can the children. the children have one complete medical history, which can be useful for them. if necessary, the parents can seek a referral to a suitable paediatrician to provide advice as may be required. 41 both parties have engaged with the children\u2019s health and development. it is extraordinary that the parties\u2019 communication was so poor y was seen by two different speech therapists. this is a problem for the parents to work on, so they improve their communication. both of them give evidence that they are prepared to work on these issues. a programme such as keeping contact, suggested by the report writer, will assist the parties. such services also provide referrals to mediation, which may help where disputes occur. whilst the parents have some difficulties in reaching agreements at the present time, they are working towards improving that. i do not find there is a basis for ordering sole parental responsibility to the mother, and instead propose ordering equal shared parental responsibility for the children. conclusion 42 as is clear from these reasons, i find that both parents have a great deal to offer their children. the orders are intended to assist the parties improve their communication, and to minimise the potential for the children to be exposed to conflict between them. this will allow the children the best opportunity to develop a meaningful relationship with each of their parents. associate: dated: 29 october 2021 [1] family law act 1975 (cth) s60cc(2)(a).

given to changing the current shared care arrangements to reduce the time that [x] is away from either parent, such as [x] living with his mother every monday and tuesday night, and [x] living with his father every wednesday and thursday night, and with each of his parent\u2019s alternate weekends.[1] hat is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents\u2019 proposals embraced in competing applications involve again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children\u2019s best interests.[5] background the parties had very different narratives about the nature of their relationship. however both acknowledged that [x] is a happy little boy who loves spending time with each of them, which suggests both have been able to protect him from their conflicted relationship and current proceedings. ..... both acknowledge that [x], who has never experienced his parents living together, as a couple, is a happy little boy who is oblivious, up to now, of any discord between his parents.[8] unless both parties shift from their polarised views of each other and become genuinely committed to mutually supporting, fostering and facilitating [x]\u2019s relationship with the other parent, (which will require improved communication between them, focussed on ensuring consistent care routines across the households, including night time toileting practices), then [x]\u2019s current transitional distress may well develop into maladaptive behaviours that can only be viewed as detrimental to his emotional wellbeing in the long term.[10] while the parents had [earlier] presented as child-focussed and appeared willing to resolve their issues, this is clearly not the case now, and there was no indication that the parties could successfully co-parent due to their animosity towards and/or abuse of each other.[13] i have only recently come to terms with the sexual assaults. i also took the step of reporting them to the police, which i had come to feel i needed to do, despite feeling humiliated and exposed.[16] the evidence & issues the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term unacceptable risk. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.[23] the parties the parties\u2019 present circumstances issues surrounding the mother\u2019s mental health and substance abuse x and pork consumption x\u2019s attire it is my belief that the mother deliberately dressed [x] in girl\u2019s clothing and accessories, subverting the child\u2019s identity and gender to try and get a negative reaction from me. i believe that the manipulation of [x] in this way is confusing and harmful to him.[33] pre-school issues given your low iq, i tried to make it very simple, but after my two emails, you still did not get it... everything that comes out of your mouth is a lie. if you were a bit clever...when one goes to uni at 40+ with illustrious alcohol dependency career, one loses the ability of mind to critically read, analyse and understand ideas. to which the mother replied with you will not be seeing x until we have come to an agreement. this stance is justified by her assertion \u2013 i am x\u2019s primary carer.[34] hacking issues and restraining order events leading up to the interim hearing of may 2022 the family report e father] presented as singularly focussed on criticisms of the mother\u2019s parenting of [x], with these criticisms informing his belief that he is the better parent and that [x] is at risk in the mother\u2019s care. at no point the father was the father able to identify anything positive about the mother, despite being given opportunities to do so.[38] mpressed as [being] weary and emotionally overwrought, which she attributed to having been subjected to unremitting belittling and denigration by the father, both during the relationship and post separation.[39] this accorded with my own impression of her. ..i think my recommendations still stand, you know, when i listen to what has been happening thus far, in a sense of having [x] in the same time with each parent, say, monday-tuesday with mum, wednesday and thursday with dad. fixed days every week. he\u2019s not too long away from either parent. and then alternate weekends. and that allows the parents to do specific things on the nights that they always have the child during term. this is my recipe for parallel parenting, i might say. yes? and there\u2019s no real need to communicate a lot. handovers are all at school, because he\u2019s now seven, so he will be at school. so that minimises and face-to-face contact. both parents will need to make sure that they keep in touch with the school, so that there\u2019s any \u2013 so that they\u2019re aware of what is going to be happening on the days that they have the child. well, the school can be enjoined to do that ? exactly, yes. and say, \u201clook, two reports. two sets of newsletters\u201d? yes, which they would be doing now, i would imagine, anyway. i would imagine. no one has told me? because i think, as i said before \u2013 i think both of them complement each other in a sense of who they are as people. and i think if they could just offer that side of \u2013 see, high conflict doesn\u2019t only affect [x]. it affects their parenting abilities as well. so they\u2019re diminished as parents whilst they\u2019re in this conflict. so [x] is actually losing \u2013 double fault \u2013 the effect on him, but also the effect on each of his parents who, i have to say, after separating in 2014 \u2013 they have been in unremitting conflict since then. that has to take its toll on an adult\u2019s psyche and ability \u2013 in their mental health, their wellbeing \u2013 everything \u2013 and their ability to parent. so this conflict is not just about the impact on [x]. it\u2019s about the impact on these parents and their ability to be parents. it\u2019s diminishing, the longer they stay in this system, and the longer they don\u2019t settle down with an arrangement that\u2019s viable for [x], and to let go of all this past conflict, because i can\u2019t imagine what [x]\u2019s life is like now. to sum, are you saying it\u2019s in na\u00efve to think through this process, one party is going to land the knockout blow on the other? no. they would have done that well and truly by now, if that had been the case. this is \u2013 there\u2019s no end in sight in regard to this conflict. usually, conflict resolves about 12 months \u2013 high conflict resolves after about 12 months after separation, where there\u2019s a sort of settling down and \u2013 but this hasn\u2019t happened in this one. it has escalated. listening to what has happened, it has actually escalated. and whether that\u2019s covid underpinning that \u2013 we can all blame covid for everything, but the fact that it\u2019s still present and we\u2019re still in this system \u2013 i had thought that this was the second day of the trial, but i\u2019ve been told it\u2019s the fifth day of trial. we\u2019re in a system where there\u2019s no winners, really.[40] there was a strong sense that [x] could not understand why his father wanted him to live with him more than he lived with his mother when he felt that he loved both parents equally. when questioned about the current parenting arrangements [x] said they were \u201ckinda okay\u201d before adding spontaneously, \u201cthe thing is...i\u2019d really like for my mum to live in the same house as my dad...when i was born they did live in the same house but the truth is they don\u2019t like each other now\u201d. [x] was clearly conflicted by the realisation that his parents do not like each other, and his awareness in this regard suggests that he has been exposed to conflict between his parents, and/or denigration by one or other of his parents. this was confirmed when [x] reported, \u201cmy dad says mean things about my mum...sometimes he says i can\u2019t do stuff at his house\u201d. [x] described \u201ckinda\u201d missing his mother when with his father and after a long pause, he added that he \u201ckinda\u201d missed his father when he was with his mother. however, [x] spontaneously disclosed at this point, upon reflection, \u201ci might love my mum a tad bit stronger than my dad\u201d. there was no sense that [x] had been influenced or coached in his responses but rather that he was trying to measure his sense of emotional loss when with one or other parent. [x]\u2019s expressed emotional bias for his mother over his father is commensurate with his young age and ongoing emotional reliance on his mother. when comparing living with each parent, [x] said that he has \u201cfun times\u201d with both parents, although he added, \u2018sometimes i get bored in the car\u2019. he said he has been smacked by both parents, adding, \u201cmum hits me when i\u2019m naughty and dad jokes he hits me by hitting me softly on my bum\u201d. he then described having \u201ca very big bed at dad\u2019s...i sleep there all by myself\u201d and that \u201csometimes\u201d he sleeps with his mother adding, \u201cthe first night of each week i sleep with mum before when i get handed (sic) over at school\u201d, which is consistent with the mother\u2019s report that [x] is still struggling to separate from her when he knows he will not be seeing her for six days. when asked what three wishes he would choose, [x] reiterated his wish for his mother to live with his father, adding, \u201cand to have infinity wishes and for everyone i know to have super powers\u201d. the overall impression of [x] is that he enjoys his time with each of his parents but his emotional needs are being met more by his mother than by his father.[41] the father was attentive and interactive with [x] in this setting, introducing educative themes, such as encouraging [x] to count in [language d] and translating english words into [language d]. at one point, [x] climbed on his father\u2019s shoulders, which made his father laugh before they then began talking about [sports] ... there was a sense of indulgent playfulness between father and son, with ball games and shared memories and experiences...[42] each parent blames the other for being \u201cimpossible\u201d to communicate with, with neither seeming to realise the detrimental effect on [x] of the poor relations between them. both parents are likely to feel under siege and defensive and less inclined to communicate with the other about [x], much to [x]\u2019s detriment as he needs consistency and stability in both households if he is to maintain a healthy developmental trajectory.[43] unless both parties shift from their polarised views of each other and become genuinely committed to mutually supporting, fostering and facilitating [x]\u2019s relationship with the other parent, (which will require improved communication between them, focussed on ensuring consistent care routines across the households, including night time toileting practices), then [x]\u2019s current transitional distress may well develop into maladaptive behaviours that can only be viewed as detrimental to his emotional wellbeing in the long term. [x]\u2019s reference to his need to sleep with his mother at the beginning of the week before he transitioned to his father on tuesday, is consistent with the mother\u2019s report that [x] struggles to separate from her when he knows he will not be seeing her for six days. whilst this report does not support a shift from shared care of [x] to the father\u2019s proposal for primary carer and sole parental responsibility for [x], the current shared care arrangements appear to be placing undue stress on [x]. accordingly, consideration could be given to changing the shared care arrangements so that [x] is not away from either parent for six days, such as [x] living with each parent for two fixed days/nights each week, along with alternate weekends during the school term, which is in effect, a 50:50 shared care arrangement, which was the father\u2019s original proposal. whilst these arrangements increase the number of transitions for [x], with the bulk of handovers at school, and with the understanding that he will be not be away from either parent for more than two sleeps, (apart from weekends) it is anticipated that his separation anxiety will not be as acute, as seems currently to be the case. with the fixed days the parents\u2019 will be able to arrange activities for [x] that do not require the other parent to continue in their time. however, extracurricular activities on the weekends will require an agreement between the parties so that [x] is able to attend that specific activity each weekend, rather than miss out if one parent has not agreed to the activity.[44] legal

parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both

family member to be fearful. aving a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child\u2019s best interests.[47] ...it is not as if, as soon as communication difficulties between the parties, or other difficulties between them are identified, the discretion ought not be exercised... rather, the matter is one of balancing all relevant factors...[57] in my view, i must be careful not to adopt an unduly utopian standard for the parties\u2019 communication skills or expect them to adhere to a standard, which is clearly untenable, given that they separated in difficult and acrimonious circumstances, as many couples do, particularly those that seek the court\u2019s assistance to resolve their parenting disputes. whilst parental responsibility is vaguely defined, some insight into what is needed from a parent can be seen in s 65dac(3) which provides that if both parents have that responsibility, they are taken to be required to consult about parenting issues and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision. it will again be remembered that the focus of the objects and principles in this act is on joint parenting.[61] s a broad concept as described in s 61b and that task covers many things. parents are expected jointly to endeavour to promote their children\u2019s development by ensuring they have the greatest potential in adulthood whilst at the same time enjoying the security of childhood they deserve.[62] decisions about international travel are difficult to make because no-one can foretell the future and the decision i have to make here amounts to a leap of faith. the court determines

order was also made under section 68l appointing an independent children\u2019s lawyer to represent the interests of the children in the proceedings and ultimately, mr holmes was allocated that role through legal aid nsw. stated he felt much calmer about not going to dad\u2019s housed [sic] \u2013 he said he has not had to hide. he stated that he sometimes hides at dad\u2019s house when he has been drinking as he yells and gets angry. [y] stated that his dad drinks and drives, but he calls it, his juice but will never share any. the other significant issue for [mr farrer] has been his alcohol misuse. he acknowledged that for a number of years he had been consuming too much alcohol, and at one point he was drinking excessively every day. he described clear withdrawal symptoms, experiencing shaking and sweats as well as increased tolerance. he stated that initially he would drink with clients at work when he was working in [the building industry]. he stated that he has now cut down and does not drink monday to thursday, but will still consume up to 10 or 12 standard drinks each day over the weekend. farrer]was adamant that excessive alcohol consumption has not been and is not currently an issue for him. he advised that [mr farrer] raised it as an issue during the relationship and as a result, he felt \u201cpressured\u201d to attend the gp and say it was an issue. ...he acknowledged he submitted fraudulent cdt test result but was resolute that it was not because he had been consuming alcohol but because he found it \u201cridiculous\u201d that he had to pay $90 per month to \u201csatisfy\u201d [ms farrer]\u2019s false allegations. [mr farrer] then said that him having to undertake cdt testing was \u201ca crock of shit\u201d and that [mr farrer] has been \u201clying for two years\u201d. ...reported that he was concerned that [ms farrer] was possibly using \u2018ice\u2019 as she is friends with a person who uses it, she had lost weight and presented as very angry. he acknowledged that he has never observed [ms farrer] take illicit drugs. during his cross examination the father was asked about the assertion he made to ms k about the mother using ice, and when referred to the mother\u2019s evidence in paragraph 69 of her trial affidavit he conceded that the reasons given by the mother for losing weight \u2013 the stress she experienced toward the end of their cohabiting relationship due to financial pressure and the father\u2019s behaviour toward her and excessive alcohol consumption \u2013 could well be the cause of the mother\u2019s rapid weight loss. the father\u2019s attempt to assert to the family consultant a suspicion that the mother was using ice was, when all the evidence is weighed, entirely disingenuous, if not deliberately dishonest. it seems that [mr farrer] also consumed alcohol on father\u2019s day, with the children present, despite the court order prohibiting him from doing so. [mr farrer] downplayed this, stating that it was one drink, which may indicate [mr farrer]\u2019s lack of respect for court orders or his utter frustration with the situation and inability to regulate his actions and emotions. the father conceded that on father\u2019s day 2020, the occasion being referred to, he had consumed a couple of alcoholic drinks while the children were with him and when it was put to him that at the relevant time there was a court order restraining him from consuming alcohol while the children were in his care, he responded, \u201cthere might\u2019ve been.\u201d he then conceded that he had knowingly disobeyed that order, though when asked, \u201cdo you consider that you are justified in having a beer with your father?\u201d, he responded, \u201cyes.\u201d when asked if he understood why the mother was concerned about his willingness to follow court orders he replied, \u201cyes\u201d, but he only considered that the mother was \u201csomewhat\u201d justified in having a concern. a mental health assessment has not been done as yet, it is being completed through my work and are backlogged, however given my job requires the work [undertaken] i believe i am aware of mental health and their part in day to day life. during his cross examination by the mother\u2019s counsel, the father was taken to that part of his trial affidavit, and the fact that he had not undertaken a mental health assessment, despite the recommendation in the family report from 28 january 2021 \u2013 one year and 9 months prior \u2013 and it was then put to him that he considered any such mental health assessment to be \u201ca waste of time\u201d, to which the father replied, \u201ccorrect.\u201d he conceded during his cross examination that at the time of the final hearing he was still taking the antidepressant medication that he had been prescribed in 2018. the evidence of the family consultant \u2013 ms k ] [x] said she has no relationship with her father, and she refers to him as \u2018[mr farrer]. she said that she could not remember a time when they had a positive relationship, which she attributed to her father not being available to her as he was either working, drinking alcohol or sleeping... [x]advised that she has no relationship with \u2018[ms r]\u2019 as she has never met her. [68] [x] said that when she did spend time with [mr farrer], that \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019 frequently blamed her mother for \u201cmanipulating\u201d the children but [x] insisted that she has never heard her mother speak negatively about \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019. [x] said that she has never felt unsafe with her mother as with \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019, particularly when he reportedly \u201cyelled\u201d at her when she said that she wanted to return to her mother or when he took her mobile phone. [x] alleged that \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019 often blamed her when her mother called the police on him. [69] [x] said that she does not want to see \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019 but she would like to collect her belongings from \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019s house\u2019 (bed, toys, desk and coin collection), when \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019 is not present. she was adamant that she is not open to any form of counselling or family therapy to address the issues with her relationship with \u2018[mr farrer]\u2019 but that she is happy to continue to attend \u2018[ms ax]\u2019 (ms ax).

[mr farrer] is adamant that this is not an issue, repeating numerous times throughout the interview that he has done nothing wrong. if [mr farrer]\u2019s allegations are valid, this is concerning as [mr farrer] has not acknowledged the issue, which indicates his lack of insight into how his reported alcohol misuse is impacting the parental conflict and more importantly his relationship with the children. if it were found that [mr farrer] does have alcohol misuse issues, for this situation to improve [mr farrer] would need to accept any difficulties he is experiencing and meaningfully engage in support for this. this would be important for the children to know and understand, because [x] and [y] are firmly of the belief that the father is an alcoholic and they may require specific therapeutic support in respect of this. ... it seems that [x]\u2019s relationship with [mr farrer] is fractured. if [ms farrer] and [x]\u2019s accounts are accurate then [x]\u2019s rejection of the father may be justified and required to protect her mental health. however, without the aid of some therapeutic support, to explore the issues within their relationship and assist [mr farrer] to acknowledge his part in the deterioration, this rejection could possibly lead to long-term mental health issues for [x]. from what the family consultant witnessed in [y] and [z]\u2019s observation with [mr farrer], it would seem that [y] and [mr farrer]\u2019s relationship is at risk of deteriorating. if this was to occur this too could lead to [y] experiencing some long-term mental health difficulties, which could impact other aspects of his educational, social and behavioural development. it may be appropriate for the entire family, including partners (given the alleged issues in the children\u2019s relationships with [ms r]) if determined appropriate by a family therapist, to participate in the family therapy, to address the various relationship dynamics and issues arising within the family. for this to have the opportunity to be successful it would require both parents being fully in support of it occurring, encouraging the children\u2019s participation, being honest regarding their behaviours and employing any strategies and feedback provided. farrer]\u2019s alleged alcohol misuse has been a concern for [ms farrer], [x] and [y] for some time, with [x] and [y] being very clear about the upset it causes them during the cic. it is worrying that, [mr farrer] went to the trouble of forging four cdt results between august and october 2020. this indicates either that [mr farrer]\u2019s alcohol misuse is an ongoing issue that he has either refused or struggles to address or that [mr farrer] has difficulty in regulating his emotions and actions to enable him to do what is required of him, due to being angered by having to \u201csatisfy\u201d [ms farrer] by undertaking these cdt tests...unfortunately, due to [mr farrer]\u2019s actions, it is not possible accept [sic] that alcohol is not a significant issue for him. it seems that [mr farrer] also consumed alcohol on father\u2019s day, with the children present, despite the court order prohibiting him from doing so. [mr farrer] downplayed this, stating that it was one drink, which may indicate [mr farrer]\u2019s lack of respect for court orders or his utter frustration with the situation and inability to regulate his actions and emotions. however, it may also indicate that [mr farrer] engages in such problematic use of alcohol that he is unable to abstain, even when he has court ordered restraints in place. ...the children\u2019s emotional and physical safety are at risk due to a possible exposure to their father driving under the influence of alcohol, [mr farrer] allegedly easily becoming angered and frustrated and being unable to demonstrate a consistent interest in undertaking activities or parenting tasks, due to being intoxicated or hung over. ] if the parents are unable to work towards improving their co-parenting relationship, and every decision to be made regarding the children causes further parental conflict, it may be that the court needs to consider granting sole parental responsibility to one parent, which is likely to be [ms farrer], as she has been and continues to be, the children\u2019s primary carer. [95] ideally, it would be hoped that family therapy, in conjunction with individual therapeutic support, may assist in positively progressing the various relationships along with the parents\u2019 capacity to reach agreement. if this was the case, the parents, with the aid of the family therapist, may be able to decide upon a plan to progress to children\u2019s time to alternate weekends and block periods during school holidays. this situation would be more easily achieved it [mr farrer] could provide evidence that he is refraining from consuming alcohol with the children present, particularly since this is a concern for the children. however, given the lack of progress in the family situation since the cic assessment in december 2019, there is a significant chance that the family therapy will not be successful, the co-parenting relationship will not improve and that [x] and [y]\u2019s (and possibly in time [z]\u2019s) relationship with [mr farrer] will continue to deteriorate. if the situation continues as it is, the family consultant does not think it would be positive for the children to recommence overnight time on alternate weekends and for block periods during school holidays as per [mr farrer]\u2019s proposal. particularly given that both [z] and [y] have reported that they do not want this to occur and the concerns regarding [mr farrer]\u2019s reported alcohol misuse. another option that could be considered is that the children spend no time with [mr farrer]. however, this could have detrimental impact on [y] and [z]\u2019s long-term relationship with [mr farrer] and their emotional well-being in the long-term...fortnightly, day only time and day only time on special occasions seems to be the most suitable option at this stage. however, over the course of time between the preparation of the family report in january 2021 and the final hearing in october 2022 the father did not provide evidence that he had refrained from consuming alcohol with the children present. both y and z began to refuse to spend any time with, or communicate at all, with their father. ] ideally, it would be hoped that family therapy, in conjunction with individual therapeutic support, may assist in positively progressing the various relationships along with the parents\u2019 capacity to reach agreement. if this was the case, the parents, with the aid of the family therapist, may be able to decide upon a plan to progress to children\u2019s time to alternate weekends and block periods during school holidays. this situation would be more easily achieved it [mr farrer] could provide evidence that he is refraining from consuming alcohol with the children present, particularly since this is a concern for the children. however, given the lack of progress in the family situation since the cic assessment in december 2019, there is a significant chance that the family therapy will not be successful, the co-parenting relationship will not improve and that [x] and [y]\u2019s (and possibly in time [z]\u2019s) relationship with [mr farrer] will continue to deteriorate. if the situation continues as it is, the family consultant does not think it would be positive for the children to recommence overnight time on alternate weekends and for block periods during school holidays as per [mr farrer]\u2019s proposal. particularly given that both [z] and [y] have reported that they do not want this to occur and the concerns regarding [mr farrer]\u2019s reported alcohol misuse. another option that could be considered is that the children spend no time with [mr farrer]. however, this could have detrimental impact on [y] and [z]\u2019s long-term relationship with [mr farrer] and their emotional well-being in the long-term...fortnightly, day only time and day only time on special occasions seems to be the most suitable option at this stage. however, over the course of time between the preparation of the family report in january 2021 and the final hearing in october 2022 the father did not provide evidence that he had refrained from consuming alcohol with the children present. both y and z began to refuse to spend any time with, or communicate at all, with their father. however, over the course of time between the preparation of the family report in january 2021 and the final hearing in october 2022 the father did not provide evidence that he had refrained from consuming alcohol with the children present. both y and z began to refuse to spend any time with, or communicate at all, with their father. the law -

[72] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said: ] in that respect, it is both interesting and instructive to refer to what has been said about this issue first by the honourable john fogarty am, and, secondly, by an english author, (the latter qualified as both a psychiatrist and a barrister.) [73] the latter said: ] the latter said: risk assessment in any situation involves, in essence, the asking of the following questions: (1) what harmful outcome is potentially present in this situation? (2) what is the probability of this outcome coming about? (3) what risks are probable in this situation in the short, medium and long term? (4) what are the factors that could increase or decrease the risk that is probable? (5) what measures are available whose deployment could mitigate the risks that are probable? (b. mahendra, 'psychiatric risk assessment in family and child law' (2008) 38 family law 569). ] mr fogarty, writing in the australian journal of family law said this (20 ajfl 249 at 254-5): ... the reality is that all courts deal with issues of \"risk\" and degrees of risk (however described) in various situations and that concept is increasingly used in legislation. risk is difficult to define in a way which is not ultimately circular. but it is an inevitable part of life at all its levels. it is inherently risky to breathe, eat, drink, walk, drive, work, invest and play. the world is full of different risks and consequences and everyone is prone to dangers. we confront varying levels of risk everyday. people frequently face potentially dangerous situations, not many live at home in complete isolation to avoid getting in harms way. most people try to avoid what they perceive to be risk, some willingly take on high risk activities. risk involves two component, the degree of \"likelihood\" of the happening of an event, and the possible consequences (good or bad) if it does [cases and citations omitted]. individuals in their assessment of some risks may focus more on one than the other of these components. but at some point it usually becomes necessary for that person to make a judgment of the risk and whether it can/should be taken. where the risk relates to a third person to whom one owes a responsibility, it is likely in the nature of things that the estimate will be conservative. risks are relative and usually involve trade-offs. crossing the road with oncoming traffic to catch the last connection to the airport involves the risk of being hit by a car or the risk of missing the plane. very much a balancing exercise of facts, experience and intuition, but essentially which risk carries the greater detriment (usually the car). then there is the common experience of a mother watching her child cross a road to go to school. the risk is seen as greater (although it may not be) because the consequences may be death or injury to the child and because the responsibilities of the mother will be seen by her as greater than for herself or another adult .... at times the courts and the legislature have attempted to give an indication of the content or quality of the risk -- otherwise \u201crisk\u201d may mean any risk, however small or unlikely. hence the use of adjectives such as \u201cserious\u201d, \u201cgrave\u201d, \u201creal\u201d, \u201cappreciable\u201d and \u201cunacceptable\u201d. ] i respectfully agree, as i also do with mr fogarty's statement (which also has echoes in the english author's statement earlier quoted) that: ... unacceptable risk in the high court's formulation [in m v m (1988) 166 clr 69] requires two separate steps. is there a risk, and is it unacceptable? the concentration by the high court is upon both the nature and the degree of risk in the particular case. its formulation is all about balance. in some cases a risk is \"acceptable\" when balanced against other factors and other orders. the object of safeguards is to convert an unacceptable situation to an acceptable one where that is feasible and is of \"benefit to the child\". it is, as i suggested earlier, calibrated to its use in individual cases. it is unrelated to the exoneration or otherwise of the alleged abuser, it is all about the bests interests of the child and protection from risk in napier & hepburn, the full court emphasised that it is not for the court to find a solution which will eliminate any chance of serious harm. rather, it is to balance the harm that will follow if the risk is not minimised or removed, as against a normal, healthy relationship between a parent and a child not being permitted to prosper. section 60cc \u2013 the primary considerations section 60cc \u2013 the additional considerations any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as each child\u2019s maturity or

79(4)(e) directs the court\u2019s attention.[12] the existing liabilities of the parties, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, and (c) the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court\u2019s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court\u2019s attention.[12] the rights of the parties, if any, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles and under legislation, in relation to any asserted resources of the parties that may, if it is considered just and equitable to proceed with the property settlement, be taken into account in the court\u2019s consideration of the matters referred to in section 75(2) of the act, to which section 79(4)(e) directs the court\u2019s attention.[12] in many cases where an application is made for a property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife. no less importantly, the express and implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship. that is, any express or implicit assumption that the parties may have made to the effect that existing arrangements of marital property interests were sufficient or appropriate during the continuance of their marital relationship is brought to an end with the ending of the marital relationship. and the assumption that any adjustment to those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4).[14] first, \u201cthe court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities, and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing\u201d,[16] second, \u201cthe court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b), and (c), and determine the contribution-based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties\u201d, [17] (c) third, \u201cthe court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (\u201cthe other factors\u201d) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...\u201d,[18] (d) fourth, \u201cthe court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case\u201d.[19] third, \u201cthe court should identify and assess the relevant matters ... (\u201cthe other factors\u201d) including...the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant...\u201d,[18] (d) fourth, \u201cthe court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case\u201d.[19] fourth, \u201cthe court should ... resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case\u201d.[19] ... indeed, the authorities are consistent in finding that assessing contributions is not an accounting exercise but a holistic one (brandt & brandt [1997] famca 21, (1997) flc 92-758, norbis & norbis (1986) 161 clr 513).[22] ] as is plain from earlier decisions of this court, regard must be had to the use made of contributions of various types so as to compare the contributions made by each of the parties during the course of, and over the length of, their relationship (see, for example, in the marriage of pierce (1998) flc 92-844) but that is an entirely different proposition to, as it were, causally linking contributions with their asserted financial \u201cproduct\u201d or \u201cvalue\u201d. the former recognises that the nature, form and extent of contributions made by each of the parties might differ, the latter suggests that the absence of a causal link counts as no contribution at all. [15] the search for a causal link might be seen to come instinctively to the necessary inquiry and all the more so when regard is had to s 79(4)(a) which refers to financial contributions made \u201c...directly or indirectly...\u201d \u201c...to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property ...\u201d and goes on to also refer to the financial contribution made \u201c...otherwise in relation to any of that last-mentioned property...\u201d the terms of that sub-paragraph might, naturally enough, be seen to suggest a causal link between those contributions and the \u201cfinancial product\u201d which those contributions of that type are said to have produced. that same requirement might also be seen to suggest that relevant contributions of that type can be seen to be quantifiable \u2013 or, at least, conceptualised \u2013 in monetary terms, in contradistinction to contributions made pursuant to s 79(4)(c). [16] while that apparent \u201ccausal connection\u201d might be seen in s 79(4)(a) (and (b)), no such connection is apparent from the terms of s 79(4)(c), contributions of that latter type are not linked by the words of the sub-paragraph to the \u201c...acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property...\u201d or, indeed, to \u201cproperty\u201d at all. this is not a legislative oversight, the 1983 amendments to the act which inserted the current s 79(4)(c) were specifically intended, relevantly, to remove any suggestion that there needed to be a causal link between contributions of that type and any particular asset or property. the explanatory memorandum to the family law act amendment bill 1983 provides, at clause 36, that a specific purpose of the re-casting of s 79(4) was, relevantly, to: ... revise sub-section 79(4) to remove the possibility of an interpretation of the sub-section requiring that there be a nexus between a spouse\u2019s contribution and a specific item of property in section 79 proceedings ...[24] ...the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial, and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by section 79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period.[26] as the chief justice points out, with those principles in mind, the trial judge adopted a broad-brush approach to the parties\u2019 respective expenditure. nowhere error is established by reason alone of that approach, authority eschews \u201coverly pernickety analysis\u201d and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been \u201cwasted\u201d or to amount to a unilateral \u201cpremature distribution of property\u201d and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed.[27] is it just and equitable to make an order altering the interests of the parties in the property? addbacks ] to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are: (a) where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm v jlm [1998] famca 97, (1998) 23 fam lr 396 the full court said (at 410-411): 11.6 for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in in marriage of townsend [1994] famca 144, (1994) 18 fam lr 505 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said (at 509): in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband\u2019s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly. in the circumstances outlined by baker j in in marriage of kowaliw [1981] famca 70, [1981] flc 91-092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. conduct of the kind referred to in para. (a) and (b) above having economic consequences is clearly in my view relevant under sec 75(2)(o) to applications for settlement of property instituted under the provisions of sec 79. [31] as the full court said in browne v green [1999] famca 1483, [1999] flc 92-873 at 86,360: ] we agree with her honour that the principles stated by baker j in kowaliw certainly do not constitute any form of fixed code. they are no more than guidelines for use in the exercise of the discretionary jurisdiction conferred by s 79 of the family law act 1975. nevertheless, they have over the considerable period of time since they were enunciated, become a well accepted guideline in this jurisdiction \u2014 a guideline the use of which assists in the achievement of the important goal of consistency within the jurisdiction.[30] where one party unilaterally distributes to themselves property which no longer exists and which, but for that premature distribution, would be susceptible to section 79 orders, justice and equity may require the court to take account of the dissipated property by adding it back as against the dissipating party (townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569). whether that should occur, or whether the dissipation should be taken into account pursuant to section 75(2)(o), or indeed at all, are all matters requiring the exercise of a trial judge\u2019s discretion (in the marriage of ad and ac townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569, omacini & omacini, cerini & cerini [1998] famca 143).[32] 7] at [50] to [65] of the first reasons under the heading \u201cadd-backs,\u201d the trial judge held that $25,000 withdrawn by the husband from the parties\u2019 bank accounts post-separation should be added back into the pool of assets, and further concluded that $50,000 which the husband had, post-separation, paid to his parents, purportedly in repayment of a loan from them, should also be added back. [138] there is no error committed per se in adjusting the parties\u2019 actual property interests by a calculation involving notionally adding back into the pool sums which have been dissipated by the parties. we reject any suggestion that the decision of bevan & bevan [2013] famcafc 116, (2013) flc 93-545 \u2013 or, more particularly, the decision of the high court in stanford & stanford (2012) 247 clr 108 - is authority for any necessary contrary solution. some statements made by the high court may lead to the conclusion that references to \u201cnotional property\u201d as have been referred to in decisions of this court and at first instance may need to be reconsidered. [139] the decisions referred to seek to remind the court that, however the exercise of discretion might seek to deal with property that is said to be the subject of \u201cadd back\u201d, proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property, and the question posed by s 79(2) as a separate inquiry from any adjustment to property interests by reference to s 79(4) if a consideration of s 79(2) reveals that it is just and equitable to alter existing interests in property.[33] ] we observe that \u201cnotional property\u201d, which is sometimes \u201cadded back\u201d to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute \u201cproperty of the parties to the marriage or either of them\u201d, and thus is not amenable to alteration under section 79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage \u2013 and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that section 79(4) and in particular section 75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property.[34] ] ... the way in which non-existent property is to be treated remains a matter for judicial discretion (see townsend & townsend flc 92-569) ... the provision of an agreed balance sheet providing for the inclusion of notional property would not mandate his honour\u2019s acceptance of it or that he would treat the notional property in the same way as had the parties.[35] 0] ... a court cannot create property for the purposes of alteration. section 79 empowers a court to alter interests of the parties to the proceedings in property. property is defined in section 4 of the act to mean: ... [in] relation to the parties to a marriage or either of them \u2013 means property to which those parties are, or that party is, as the case may be, entitled, whether in possession or reversion. 1] as french cj said in kennon & spry [2008] hca 56, (2008) 238 clr 366 at 390, \u201c\u2018property\u2019 in section 79 is to be read as part of the collocation \u2018property of the parties to the marriage\u2019\u201d. it is to be read widely and conformably with the purposes of the act. gummow and hayne jj said at 397 that \u201cthe term \u2018property\u2019 is not a term of art with one specific and precise meaning\u201d. the purpose of the act as set out in section 79(1) is to alter interests in property to which a party has an interest in possession or reversion.[36] guidelines for adding back to the property available at trial (a) dissipation of property and expenditure other than on legal fees [27] the full court held in omacini and omacini[37] that addbacks fall into \u201cthree clear categories\u201d: where the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and \u201cwaste\u201d or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets.[38] [28] however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever \u201ca party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation\u201d, the full court describing such a proposition as \u201cunduly simplistic\u201d.[39] an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is \u201cthe exception rather than the rule\u201d.[40] [29] the fundamental precept that addbacks are exceptional, reflected in the decisions just referred to, also mirrors what has been said in earlier decisions of the full court that, for example, \u201cthe family court must take the property of a party to the marriage as it finds it\u201d[41] at trial. an important parallel proposition is that the parties do not \u201cgo into a state of suspended economic animation\u201d after separation.[42] thus, reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback. [30] two fundamental premises emerge from omacini and the authorities preceding it. first, \u201cadding back\u201d is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not \u201cexceptional\u201d justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion \u2013 usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is \u201ca course which is, perhaps, technically more correct\u201d than adding back to the list of existing interests in property.[43] (b) expenditure on legal fees [31] to the considerations just discussed must be added the propositions emerging from authority that paid legal fees as a category of addback is imbued with considerations specific to that expenditure. the full court said in chorn: ] in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. [57] if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. [58] if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post\u2011separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post\u2011separation income or acquisitions. ] those passages can be seen as an attempt to establish \u201cguidelines\u201d,[44] undertaken after a detailed examination of earlier authorities,[45] for the treatment of paid legal fees within s 79 proceedings. there can be little doubt that the statements made in that case have been applied by trial judges ever since. [33] the word \u201cguidelines\u201d is used advisedly so as to distinguish the same from \u201cbinding principles of law\u201d.[46] the distinction is important. failure to follow a binding principle of law is an error of law. by contrast, the failure of a trial judge to follow a guideline:[47] ...does not of itself amount to error, for it may appear that the case is one in which it is inappropriate to invoke the guideline or that, notwithstanding the failure to apply it, the decision is the product of sound discretionary judgment. [however] [t]he failure to apply a legitimate guideline to a situation to which it is applicable may ... throw a question mark over the trial judge\u2019s decision and ease the appellant\u2019s burden of showing that it is wrong... ] the guidelines emerging from chorn should be read together and read conformably with the full court authorities upon which they are based. that being so, the delineations there referred to \u2014 \u201cthe funds used existed at separation ... such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them\u201d, or \u201cfunds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours\u201d or received by a party \u201cin his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)\u201d - cannot be seen as determinative of the exercise of discretion but, rather, as informing it. [35] again, the matters just referred to have important ramifications in an appellate context. they may ease the appellant\u2019s burden of showing that \u201calthough the nature of the error may not be discoverable ... a substantial wrong has in fact occurred\u201d,[48] or that the decision is \u201cplainly wrong, [the] decision being no proper exercise of [the] judicial discretion\u201d.[49] equally, they may ease the burden of establishing that irrelevant considerations have been taken into account or that relevant considerations have not been taken into account. [36] paid legal fees occupy a particular position in the consideration of addbacks by reason of s 117(1) of the act, a matter not relevant to any other form of expenditure or dissipation of property the subject of an addback claim. [37] an order failing to addback legal costs is a pre-emptive decision about one party paying the other\u2019s legal costs. the statutorily prescribed default position is that neither party pays all or some of the other party\u2019s costs.[50] [38] if, contrary to the demands of that section, there is to be a payment of costs, the award is dependent upon a finding of justifying circumstances which, in turn, is dependent upon (non-exhaustive) considerations all of which are informed by antecedent events - for example, whether one party has been \u201cwholly unsuccessful\u201d and \u201cthe conduct of the parties to the proceedings\u201d.[51] an award of the costs of trial, if any, is in the usual run of events made after the respective entitlements of the parties to a settlement of property have been assessed and, importantly, any awarded costs are paid from the assessed entitlement to property received by the paying party. [39] as has been said, legitimate guidelines \u201cguide the exercise of a discretion\u201d, they do not replace it.[52] guidelines, must \u201c[preserve], so far as it is possible to do so, the capacity ... to do justice according to the needs of the individual case\u201d.[53] the decision to addback or not addback paid legal fees remains a matter of discretion. but, a finding that it is just and equitable to not addback an amount of legal fees so paid is a finding that it is just and equitable for the other party to contribute to the costs of the first party in that proportion as part of an overall assessment of the justice and equity governing their property division. [40] the considerations just referred to are plainly always important and central to the exercise of that discretion in respect of paid legal fees. [41] the passages from chorn, quoted above, draw a distinction between legal costs met from property that would otherwise be available at trial and legal costs met from funds \u201cgenerated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance)\u201d. the proposition there advanced, that such expenditure \u201cwould generally not be added back\u201d, also needs to be seen as a guideline informing the relevant discretion rather than determining it. a further distinction is suggested in chorn between funds generated in that manner and \u201c[f]unds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement\u201d. [42] the latter suggestion recognises the discretion inherent in the task and also, perhaps, that in the particular circumstances of a case, adding back sums generated post-separation in the different manners suggested might create injustice as much as it might cure it.[54] ... [46] in stanford v stanford,[55] the high court emphasised as fundamental that a consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order begins by \u201cidentifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property\u201d.[56] [47] the essence of a claim for addbacks is that the asserted sum/s should be added to the value of the existing property interests of the parties and, subsequent to the assessment of contributions, credited to the spending party as part of the value of their assessed entitlements. doing so does not offend what was emphasised by the high court. adding back does not seek to create property interests that do not exist. rather, doing so emphasises that satisfying the respective requirements of ss 79(2) and (4) of the act to do justice and equity can require an \u201caccounting\u201d or \u201cbalance sheet\u201d exercise for the purposes of s 79(2) and (4), so as to include the value of the dissipated property or expended sums within the total value of the parties\u2019 existing interests in property, and to credit the value of same against the assessed entitlement of the dissipating or spending party.[57] the property the wife\u2019s westpac choice account ending #...82 - the wife asserts a value of $1,975 and the husband asserts a value of

[my underlining] harling], i appreciate you raising the issue of you relocating to queensland. i want to be clear that i do not consent to [x] moving with you at this point in time, as this impacts our current arrangement that provides me with 50 per cent custody. happy to have further discussions about it to see if we can come to an agreement. thanks. i advised [mr aldrich] on this occasion that [mr e] and i had decided that relocating was our best option, and that i wanted to ensure that any arrangements as to [x\u2019s] living arrangements allowed [x] to continue to spend significant time with [mr aldrich]. hey i really wanted to talk to you again about us moving to qld. we have more details of what we would like to do and i feel like sending a txt will give you a better idea of the details and you can let me know your thoughts etc. we are thinking we would like to spend 6 - 8 months in [town c] with [mr e's] family. the twins are due [...] but most likely will be here early so ideally we would like to be there some time [earlier] so we can settle in. we are definitely not planning on staying there long term, we just feel like that we will have the best support at the start there and will re evaluate. i want you to be able to see [x] whenever you want as much as possible so not sure if that would be a regular time we stick to eg fortnightly or monthly or work around your work schedule, whatever you would be comfortable with. i know my family will be able to support you when she is with you in [city b] and perhaps we can look at getting her casual days at school when she is there? i completely understand and i am well aware that this is not the easiest thing for you to contemplate but i want to make this as easy as possible and i wouldn't be bringing this to you if i didn't think it would be the best thing for us at this time. i really would like it if you would give me your honest feelings and thoughts and that nothing is closed door and that we're open to discussing this based on what you want as-well. the mediation people are going to call you to get some details. i assume it will likely be today but may be tomorrow. there are costs associated with mediation that we will need to work out also. okay thanks. i am curious though what do you wish to achieve from mediation? do you want full custody of her? you have no grounds for stopping us moving, so i'm not sure what you expect the outcome to be? i'm not restricting you seeing her and there is no abuse of any form. my main priority is what's best for [x\u2019s] well being and development. i'm not pursuing full custody as i don't think that's in [x\u2019s] best interests as i think it is vitally important for her to have a relationship with both her parents. should the situation or determination ever occur that i have full custody i would have no hesitation in accepting if that was in her best interest excellent so in you being concerned about what the best option for her would be in regard to her fostering relationships with family and her development than [sic] realistically the best option would be for her to be with me the majority of the time because if she was with you she would spend her entire week in care or in the care of someone else. which will be fine for her 50 per cent of the time maximum. therefore the only thing to figure out for us is the terms of when you want to see her when we move. as i have stated in my emails and in person, you can see her whenever you wish within our 50/50 arrangement if that is less i am happy to accommodate this. you do not have to tell me dates now you can tell me as we go when you would like me to bring her back but [mr e] starts work in early feb so we will be leaving [in] feb. if you feel we need mediation to work out the exact dates you want to see her... moving for employment i don't require your 'consent' as i am still allowing full agreed access to her. you can either start working together as her parents or continue along this unhappy path you are creating for yourself. it's your call. [my underlining] 11. the mother proposed initially that [x] could continue to spend time between [city b] and [town c] on a fortnightly rotating arrangement. when quizzed about the prospect of this from a practicable aspect in considering [x\u2019s] enrolment in schooling next year, the mother explained that she believed the father would have agreed to her residing in her primary care in [town c] due to his past history of being unavailable to care for her at times. the mother also explained that the father works full-time and she considered that he would see that she was better placed to offer primary care to [x] due to her availability. as i know that is not my decision to make, has nothing to do with me but it does effect [x] and that is my concern. without knowing the details of your planned relocation i can see that it will be harder to do with [x] in your care so she can remain here with me while you're relocating and then we can work out the details once you are settled. if it makes you feel more comfortable for you to have her for the first two weeks while we move i am happy with that. i would like to work out the details though for when i would like to see her and that is 2 weeks after we leave and that will be to meet at brisbane airport as previously discussed. interim orders of 17/03/22: spend time that [x] spend time with the mother as agreed between the parties, but failing agreement as follows: (a) for 4 x 3 week periods each year with the mother providing one (1) month's notice to the father of the dates she intends to spend with [x] and the father will do all such acts and things to facilitate the spend time, (b) for up to seven (7) nights in the event that the mother is in the [city b] area with the mother is to collect [x] from the father's residence at the commencement of time and return [x] to the father's residence at the conclusion of such time, and with the mother to give the father at least one month's notice of her intention to travel to [city b] and spend time with [x], (c) any such further time as agreed between the mother and the father. for 4 x 3 week periods each year with the mother providing one (1) month's notice to the father of the dates she intends to spend with [x] and the father will do all such acts and things to facilitate the spend time, (b) for up to seven (7) nights in the event that the mother is in the [city b] area with the mother is to collect [x] from the father's residence at the commencement of time and return [x] to the father's residence at the conclusion of such time, and with the mother to give the father at least one month's notice of her intention to travel to [city b] and spend time with [x], (c) any such further time as agreed between the mother and the father. for up to seven (7) nights in the event that the mother is in the [city b] area with the mother is to collect [x] from the father's residence at the commencement of time and return [x] to the father's residence at the conclusion of such time, and with the mother to give the father at least one month's notice of her intention to travel to [city b] and spend time with [x], (c) any such further time as agreed between the mother and the father. any such further time as agreed between the mother and the father. parties are at loggerheads: father's day 2022 / apprehended violence order: ...visibly distraught, crying, and struggling to speak with police about the incident. ...as ordered by this or another court about contact with children. there was also an additional order that: you must not go within 100 metres of (a) any place where the father or [ms j] live or (b) any place where they work or (c) any of the following places \u2013 [z street, suburb t] which is where the father and ms j were living at the time. interim orders of 13/10/22: interim orders by consent: from 31 october to 21 november 2022, (b) from 19 december 2022 to 9 january 2023, (c) from 6 february 2023 to 21 february 2023 -

[this being the last trip to queensland before the final hearing was to take place], and from 22 may 2023 to 12 june 2023. the law: ...all the duties, powers, responsibilities and authorities which, by law, parents have in relation to children. section 65dac obliges parents who share parental responsibility to consult with each other about major long-term issues and to make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision. ...the way in which the parent who properly has custody of a child may choose in a reasonable manner to order his or her way of life is one of those things which the parent who has not been given custody may well have to bear. as kirby j also points out, that central proposition has been reinforced by curial statements to the effect that, for example: [w]hen one parent has been given custody it is a very strong thing for this court to make an order which will prevent the following of a chosen career by the parent who has custody. and: [t]his line of authority shows that where the custodial parent herself, it was the mother in all those cases, has a genuine and reasonable desire to emigrate then the court should hesitate long before refusing permission to take the children. 45. his honour went on to say: this court, and other courts of australia, are not bound by the decisions of foreign courts on this or any other subject. however, where (as here) australian legislation has substantially followed a precedent in english legislation, it is obviously sensible to take into account the course of judicial authority in that country dealing with the same legislation. so much was acknowledged in ams, where the decision in poel was examined in my reasons with which, on the decisive point, gleeson cj, mchugh and gummow jj agreed. however, as his honour was also anxious to point out, and as is clear from the terms of the act itself, the application of those propositions does not give rise to any presumption or additional onus. rather, they posit the acute issues as to the best interests of the children within legitimate parental expectations and desires consequent upon marriage breakdown and the need to construct lives for parents and children consequent thereto. all applications for parenting orders before the court involve a situation that, axiomatically, is not in the children\u2019s best interests. what is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents\u2019 proposals embraced in competing applications involve, again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children\u2019s best interests. concomitantly, gummow and callinan jj said in u v u: ...the reality is that maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents: obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have been incurred. \u201crelocation cases\u201d are no different from other applications for parenting orders in that respect. like all applications for parenting orders, an application to have the children live with a parent significantly geographically remote from the other parent is to be determined by the children\u2019s best interests. however, the issues in a \u201crelocation case\u201d are, by reason of the proposed geographical separation of parents from their children, often significantly more acute and all the more so in cases of proposed international relocation. and, of course, that same factor will usually render more acute the burden or burdens to be borne by one parent or the other, including restrictions on their freedoms. ...conformably with what had been said by the high court in [ams v. aif] ...only defer to the paramount consideration of a child's best interests where those interests would be so adversely affected as to justify such interference, and then the interference is legitimate only to the extent ... necessary to avoid such adverse effects. ...changes to the child's living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent. best interests findings: section 60cc primary considerations (2) the primary considerations are: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.

(ii) in its original formulation, the rule is directed to application as a preliminary matter. yet, contemporaneously with that formulation the court in rice and asplund determined that the rule could equally be applied at the end of a full custody hearing. the consequences of that determination have received little attention. (iii) at whatever stage of a hearing the rule is applied, its application should remain merely a manifestation of the \u201cbest interests principle\u201d. (iv) discussion in terms that the rule may be applied as a \u201cpreliminary matter\u201d or the primary application be first heard \u201con the merits\u201d may be unhelpful, particularly because of the implication that, if the rule is applied as a preliminary matter, the parenting application is not then dealt with \u201con the merits\u201d. (v) the application of the rule is closely connected with the nature of, and degree of, change sought to the earlier order. (vi) \u201cshorthand\u201d statements of the rule may contribute to its misapplication. (vii) any application of the rule must now measure the evidence against the principles set out in part vii of the act, in particular the objects of the part, the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility and the steps required by the act consequent upon an order made or to be made in that regard. ] ...in my view when the threshold question described in rice and asplund is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination \u201con the merits\u201d. where an application is dismissed at a preliminary stage, it is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of a party to appear or some lack of compliance with form and procedure but rather because, assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an insufficient change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing. though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child\u2019s welfare than to allow the application to continue. it may be, however, that neither the expressions \u201csummary dismissal\u201d or \u201cstriking out\u201d is the best term to describe the procedure when, in a parenting case, the rule in rice and asplund is considered at a preliminary stage. this is because, as we seek to emphasise, at whatever stage the rule in rice and asplund is applied, the court is bound to take into account best interests considerations and also because specific requirements, including legislative requirements, apply. ] in our view, that passage [at [81] in sps & pls] need not be taken as saying that the only way in which the rule in rice and asplund can be applied at a preliminary stage is on the basis that the case of the applicant for parenting orders is taken at its highest. [82] ... the qualitative question of whether a change that has occurred is or is not sufficiently significant to justify a full further hearing of a parenting issue may be one much more difficult to answer in a preliminary hearing involving resolution of only some disputed facts. [83] this observation may be behind the approach that either the case of the applicant for parenting orders is, at a preliminary stage, taken at its highest, or the hearing embarked upon is an enquiry into all matters relating to the best interests of the child or children. [84] on the other hand, there is authority to suggest that these are not the only legitimate procedures.... nevertheless, there are significant changes that occur and which do require a court to reconsider decisions previously made. whether in a particular case a court should be willing to embark upon another hearing concerning the child and parent, or whether to do so would itself be demonstrably contrary to the best interests of the child, is a decision to be made in each particular case. how is that decision to be made? the court must look at: 1) the past circumstances, including the reasons for the decision and the evidence upon which it was based. 2) whether there is a likelihood of orders being varied in a significant way, as a result of a new hearing. 3) if there is such a likelihood, the nature of the likely changes must be weighed against the potential detriment to the child or children caused by the litigation itself. thus, for example, small changes may not have sufficient benefit to compensate for the disruption caused by significant re-litigation. if applied on a preliminary basis, the issue is whether the circumstances as disclosed by the evidence reveal a change of such significance that the best interests of the child require a revisiting of earlier orders. ... we are far from persuaded that the hurdles that have to be overcome to found a successful challenge on the basis of the weight afforded to the evidence have been scaled. it has consistently been held that where no error of fact or law is present, disagreement only on matters of weight cannot alone justify appellate interference.... this analysis leads us to the view that where the principle in rice & asplund is being considered, it will not be appropriate or necessary to discretely address many of the factors in section 60cc of the act in determining where the best interests of the child might lie. in a case where the principle in rice arises for consideration, there are two circumstances which are central to the decision. first, there will already exist a parenting order and, axiomatically, the terms of that order will reflect the best interests of the child or children at the time of its making. second, the fact that an order has been made reflects that disputation between parties to a parenting dispute, such dispute being inherently contrary to the best interests of the child whilst it exists, has been brought to an end by a curial order. those twin circumstances dictate the conclusion that it cannot logically be in the best interests of the child to embark upon further litigation enquiring as to the child\u2019s best interests unless it is first demonstrated that a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred since the parenting order was made. thus, it is entirely understandable, and in our view, not erroneous, for his honour to address the issue of \u201cbest interests\u201d by reference to whether it is in the interests of the child for there to be the further litigation proposed by the mother. indeed, we note that this was how the issue was framed in the mother\u2019s outline of argument presented to his honour at the commencement of the hearing. she said this (at paragraph 3): the central question for consideration by the court was encapsulated by warnick j in the following terms (para 81, at page 310): \u201c... though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought to be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child\u2019s welfare than to allow the application to continue.\u201d ] where the question of whether a sufficient change in circumstances has occurred is to be determined as a matter preliminary to the hearing of the application, it is accepted that the applicant\u2019s evidence should be taken at its highest. [52] it was argued for the mother that his honour erred in finding that she had failed to demonstrate a sufficient change in circumstances to justify re-opening the parenting proceedings. [53] his honour concluded at [100] that the facts did not establish \u201ca new and vital change in the circumstances\u201d, and found that it was \u201cobvious\u201d that amber had been anxious for some time and that anxiety had from time to time manifested itself in her refusing to go to school. he went on to offer what he considered to be the reasons for this, including that she had recently commenced high school. he thus found at [111] that the mother\u2019s evidence did not establish a material change of circumstances in the necessary sense. [54] the bar to appellate intervention where the challenge is to a judge\u2019s fact finding is set high. see edwards v noble (1971) 125 clr 296. [55] in order to succeed in challenging his honour\u2019s finding that there had been no change in circumstances, it is necessary to demonstrate that the finding was not open to his honour on the evidence before him. [56] thus it was argued that, had his honour indeed taken the mother\u2019s evidence at its highest it was not open to him to find that there had been no material change in circumstances. it was further argued that both his honour\u2019s conclusion that the child had always been anxious, and that her present refusal to attend school was a manifestation of a pre-existing condition and was probably due to her attending a new school, were findings unsupported by the evidence. [57] his honour\u2019s finding that the child\u2019s present anxiety and refusal to attend school was unsupported by the evidence. however, it was a conclusion reasonably open to his honour given the accepted increase in her refusing to attend school and anxiety generally with the beginning of a new school regime. it could not be said that the conclusion was not open to his honour. his honour\u2019s findings clearly accept the parties\u2019 position that amber\u2019s anxiety and school refusal had escalated. the issue for his honour was whether these circumstances led to the conclusion that there had been a material change in circumstances. his honour found that they did not. that was a determination open to him and i find no error in his conclusion. this challenge is not made out. ] in any event, while the arguments in support of the contention are framed as challenges to \u201cprinciples\u201d relating to the rule, they are, in essence, challenges to the weight which his honour attached to aspects of the evidence. [84] in my view, the findings made by his honour were entirely open to him on the evidence and it was entirely open to his honour to include the matters to which his honour made reference in reaching a determination that a material change in circumstances was not established. ] in that respect, it has been held recently that: ... plainly a circumstance can only constitute a relevant 'change' if it is a circumstance which was outside or beyond the contemplation or consideration of the parties and the court at the time the original parenting orders were made. put another way, if the current circumstances were within the contemplation of the parties and were considered by the court at the time the original parenting orders were made, there is no basis upon which they can be said to constitute a change which would justify the prospect of continuing litigation with respect to parenting arrangements, given the adverse effect which uncertainty and unpredictability with respect to parenting arrangements can be assumed to have upon the interests of the child concerned...[10] ] in my view his honour made no error as asserted on behalf of the mother. 0] the exercise of those discretions will depend, like all discretionary decisions, on a multiplicity of factors. however, the decisions will include a consideration of the nature and cogency of the evidence as to material change and the nature and extent of the orders sought to be changed. the decisions will also ordinarily involve a consideration of the notorious fact \u2013 accepted as such both by authority and by mr north in his arguments \u2013 that continued litigation and the re-agitation of contested issues about children has the potential to cause significant harm to them. [111] in some cases, those factors, and perhaps others, will persuade a court that further evidence is required before reaching a decision on the rice & asplund question. the obtaining of a family report in an appropriate case might be an example of such further evidence, although it once again needs to be pointed out that family reports do not decide cases, courts do. [112] however, the court\u2019s decision as to the evidence necessary to decide the application of \u201cthe rule in rice & asplund\u201d as a preliminary matter also involves the exercise of discretion. the exercise of that discretion will also have as its central question whether it is \u201cmore powerfully in the child[ren\u2019s] welfare\u201d to permit the obtaining of the further evidence \u2013 and what might be involved for the children in doing so \u2013 than to determine the application of the rule as a preliminary matter without that evidence. that can be seen to have particular importance when the evidence sought is a family report or the interventions of other experts that involve the participation of the children. [113] it should also be pointed out (as it was by this court in miller & harrington), that the relevant discretions must now be exercised within the mandatory principles and other provisions contained within division 12a of the act. in that respect two of the mandatory principles which must be applied by a court by reference to s 69zn of the act bear quotation: the first principle is that the court is to consider the needs of the child concerned and the impact that the conduct of the proceedings may have on the child in determining the conduct of the proceedings. (4) the second principle is that the court is to actively direct, control and manage the conduct of the proceedings. 4] in my view, contrary to the submissions made by mr north, well settled authority is entirely consistent with his honour having the power to apply \u201cthe rule in rice & asplund\u201d as a preliminary matter \u201c... even where the evidence demonstrates a material change since the previous order\u201d. [115] secondly, again contrary to mr north\u2019s submissions, it is in my view not correct to characterise his honour\u2019s actions or decisions as a failure or refusal to exercise jurisdiction in proceedings for parenting orders properly invoked by the mother. the refusal by his honour to contemplate the obtaining of a family report (or, perhaps, other evidence) so as to inform the rule at a preliminary stage was not a failure of judicial process but a discretionary decision performed within a mandatory statutory context and arrived at by reference to the children\u2019s best interests for reasons which his honour gave. [116] it is not established that his honour erred in law, that he failed to take account of relevant considerations, that he took account of irrelevant considerations or committed any other discretionary error. no error in the exercise of his honour\u2019s discretion is pleaded nor can any be seen in his honour\u2019s reasons. i consider any differences between the two phrases as semantic and not substantial. as the authorities make clear, the essential point in the application of the rule in rice and asplund is the balancing of the new circumstances against the undesirability of further litigation involving the child. the nature of that exercise will depend very much upon the nature of the changes relied upon. obviously enough, if there are no changes or if the changes are insignificant or unsubstantial, there will be little to justify reconsideration of the earlier orders. these authorities make clear that a change in circumstances is not itself the answer to the question as to whether the earlier parenting orders should be reconsidered, but that those new matters, in all of the circumstances, must be sufficient to justify or to provide for such a hearing. ] the first thing to note is that although there is no doubt that the rule in rice & asplund is a \u201cmanifestation of the best interests principle\u201d (sps & pls [2008] famcafc 16, (2008) 39 fam lr 295 at [48]), his honour\u2019s task under the rule was to determine whether there had been a significant change in circumstances since the initial order was made such that it would be in the best interests of the children to reopen the litigation. that process involves the weighing of the significance or sufficiency of the changes against the potential detriment to the children caused by the litigation itself. that potential detriment extends to all that would be involved in reopening the litigation, including the exercise of obtaining a family report. ... we should emphasise that the magnitude of the variation of the parenting orders sought to be achieved in the fresh proceedings, necessarily informs the nature of change of circumstances sufficient to justify that re-litigation. here, the mother was seeking a complete reversal of the child\u2019s living arrangements, rather than merely some minor tinkering or slender change to the new zealand orders. therefore, the nature of the change in circumstances needed to be of sufficient gravity to warrant the wholesale re-litigation of the child\u2019s living arrangements. on no view did the mother\u2019s claims come close to demonstrating a sufficient change. taking her case at its highest, it had no reasonable likelihood of success. contravention the circumstances in which a person may be taken to have had, for the purposes of this division, a reasonable excuse for contravening an order under this act affecting children include, but are not limited to, the circumstances set out in subsections (2), (4), (5), (6) and (7). a person (the respondent) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to the extent to which it deals with whom a child is to spend time with in a way that resulted in a person and a child not spending time together as provided for in the order if, a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to spend time together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child), and b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a). a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that not allowing the child and the person to spend time together was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child), and b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a). b) the period during which, because of the contravention, the child and the person did not spend time together was not longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a). ... a person (the respondent) is taken to have had a reasonable excuse for contravening a parenting order to which section 65p applies by acting contrary to section 65p if: a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the action constituting the contravention was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child), and b) the period during which, because of that action, a person in whose favour the order was made was hindered in or prevented from discharging responsibilities under the order was not for longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a). a) the respondent believed on reasonable grounds that the action constituting the contravention was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person (including the respondent or the child), and b) the period during which, because of that action, a person in whose favour the order was made was hindered in or prevented from discharging responsibilities under the order was not for longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a). b) the period during which, because of that action, a person in whose favour the order was made was hindered in or prevented from discharging responsibilities under the order was not for longer than was necessary to protect the health or safety of the person referred to in paragraph (a). ] as earlier seen, s 70nae(1) is to the effect that the circumstances described in the following subsections are not the only circumstances in which reasonable excuse may be found. while it is clear that a set of circumstances quite different in character to those set out in any of the subsections could constitute reasonable excuse, a much more difficult question is whether, if the circumstances seem to fit within the character of those set out in a subsection, that subsection describes the limits within which reasonable excuse may be found. for example, could a respondent who genuinely believed that contravention was necessary to protect a child\u2019s health, but who had no reasonable grounds for that belief, nonetheless be found to have had a reasonable excuse for contravention or, might a person who contravened an order to protect a child\u2019s health be found to have had a reasonable excuse for contravention, notwithstanding that the retention was for longer than was necessary to protect the child\u2019s health. [23] the first example might be addressed by regarding the term \u201creasonable excuse\u201d in s 70nae(1) as being an objective test, albeit one that might include \u201csubjective\u201d aspects. thus, the term \u201creasonable excuse\u201d in subsection (1) would match the term \u201con reasonable grounds\u201d in subsection (5). if this approach was taken, the same result would be achieved whether subsection (5) was expressly relied upon or not. while this conclusion does not mean that subsection (5) must be applied whenever it can \u201cfit\u201d the circumstances, it certainly does not support an opposite conclusion. [24] while subsection (5) describes circumstances in which a reasonable excuse will exist, within its term are qualifications such as \u201creasonable grounds\u201d, \u201c...necessary to protect the health...\u201d and \u201c...not longer than was necessary\u201d, which if not met will exclude some \u201cexcuses\u201d. i incline to the view that where the legislature has specifically installed qualifications on an excuse in a particular set of circumstances, it would not be open to make a finding of excuse where that limit had been exceeded, unless there were some additional circumstances that took the case out of the situation dealt with by the subsection. so, as to the second example given in the preceding paragraph, without such an additional circumstance, it would not be open to find reasonable excuse in respect of a contravention for a period that exceeded that which was necessary to protect a child\u2019s health. ... in my view, the correct approach would have been to at least attempt to measure the mother\u2019s excuse against the terms of s 70nae(5) and to explain why the subsection did not apply, if that was held to be the case.... ... the learned magistrate may well have fallen into error by applying too loose a test of \u201creasonableness\u201d. the question is not simply whether, viewed from some ill-defined concept of fairness or reasonableness, the mother\u2019s actions were excusable. the position with regard to the terms \u201creasonable grounds\u201d and \u201creasonable excuse\u201d in s 70nae is, i think, similar to that of terms of like generality, for example, \u201cany just cause\u201d used elsewhere in the act.... here, the context in which \u201creasonable excuse\u201d applied tellingly included the subsections of s 70nae. it also included that the father was entitled to spend time with the child pursuant to a court order. such an order places serious obligations on persons in the position of the mother in this case. the relevant context also includes authoritive [sic] statements of the court about like cases, of which the following statements in the marriage of gaunt [1978] famca 97, (1978) flc 90-468 are a good example (at 77,398): the essential question is this - can a party who does not agree with a court\u2019s decision about access defy the order and then plead that in preventing access his actions were based on his genuinely held belief that to allow the order to operate would be contrary to the welfare of the child? the question of the child\u2019s welfare is, of course, the paramount consideration for the court in determining the access question in the first place. to allow a party to arrogate to himself a supervening power to make an independent decision on that issue and to rely on that decision to escape from compliance with the court\u2019s order or from the consequences of non-compliance would undermine the purpose and intentions of the act. ... a party\u2019s subjective view of the rights and wrongs of a decision cannot be relied on as \u201cjust cause or excuse\u201d or \u201creasonable cause\u201d... a person is taken for the purposes of this division to have contravened

subsection (1) varying a primary order, the court, in addition to regarding, under section 60ca, the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration, must, if any of the following considerations is relevant, take that consideration into account: the person who contravened the primary order did so after having attended, after having refused or failed to attend, or after having been found to be unsuitable to take any further part in, a post\u2011separation parenting program or a part of such a program, (b) there was no post\u2011separation parenting program that the person who contravened the primary order could attend, (c) because of the behaviour of the person who contravened the primary order, it was not appropriate, in the court\u2019s opinion, for the person to attend a post\u2011separation parenting program, or a part of such a program, (d) the primary order was a compensatory parenting order made under paragraph 70neb(1)(b) or 70nfb(2)(c) after the person had contravened a previous order under this act affecting children. this section does not limit the circumstances in which a court having jurisdiction under this act may vary a primary order. a.

submissions of the father she was scared to go to the mother\u2019s house and scared of the mother\u2019s partner, [mr ag]. she then subsequently disclosed that she had been inappropriately touched by [mr ag] while spending time with the mother. a reasonable excuse in respect of concern as to the welfare of the child is limited to a belief on reasonable grounds that depriving a person of access pursuant to an order was necessary to protect the health and safety of the person. it is not a question as to whether in the view of the custodial parent, or in the view of the custodial parent on reasonable grounds that carrying out of access order might not be in the best interest of the child. the question is whether it is necessary to protect the health or safety of a person, including the child. written submissions by the mother issues in dispute i note there are three parties to this matter, [mr solberg] and [mr ranwick], applicant fathers, and [ms markwell], respondent mother. [b], [born] 2010 is the daughter of the respondent mother and [mr solberg], first applicant father. [d], [born] 2017 is the daughter of the respondent mother and [mr ranwick], the second applicant father. the applicant fathers dispute the threshold in the rule of rice & asplund has be met by the respondent mother. it is stated by the respondent mother the threshold can be met on the following grounds, a) there has been a material change in circumstances to the living arrangements of the respondent mother following forced vacation of the crisis house in [town r] in july 2021 and the ongoing inability to obtain a residence in the [city ab] region to comply with orders of 30 june 2020, b) the current orders of 30 june 2020 do not provide for the children to have a meaningful relationship with their mother and each other, c) the applicant fathers are acting in opposition with s.65dac(1)(b), (2), (3) family law act 1975 (cth), d) s.65n(2)(a)(b) provisions are not met through the current orders e) the current orders do not support the mandatory provisions of s60cc factors, f) the provisions pursuant to 65daa for substantial and significant time cannot be facilitated under the current orders, g) the first applicant father, [mr solberg], separated from [ms w] in or around may 2022 and materially changed [b]'s living arrangements, h) the department of communities & justice (dcj) have indicated in conversations that [d] is at risk of harm in the care of the second applicant father, [mr ranwick], and his partner, [ms an], following spurious allegations the child, [d], was sexually abused whilst in the mother's care, to which dcj have indicated to both parents they are not substantiating, both applicant fathers have shown an unwillingness to foster a meaningful relationship between [b] and [d], despite their claims in the substantive hearing that they would ensure the sibling bond is maintained if the children reside primarily with their respective fathers. the fathers have facilitated [b] and [d] seeing each other twice since january 2022 whilst in their respective fathers' care, the current orders are no longer reflective of the children's actual arrangements. 7. a substantial period of time has lapsed since the final orders. 8. this matter would benefit from being seen as two separate applications. the applicant fathers have disputed this is an ongoing matter and this is factually incorrect. in their case summary outline, filed and served 3 october 2022 (noting the mother was served with 2 case summary outlines, one at 5:11pm and another at 7:11pm), that pursuant to rule 5.02 this matter should be struck out. the fathers' representation file multiple documents which are very much the same in material nature. the mother was served with an affidavit on behalf of the first applicant father, [mr solberg] on 29/09/2022 at 9:18am, (12 pages) and a further affidavit at 4:08pm (14 pages) on the same date. the mother was served with an affidavit on behalf of the second applicant father, [mr ranwick] on 29 september 2022 at 10:56am (7 pages) and a further one at 4:09pm on the same date (9 pages). the affidavits filed by both applicant fathers do not comply with the orders of his honour judge neville of 14 september 2022 in that they were filed out of time and did not comply with his honours orders limited to 6 pages. it is therefore sought that the affidavits be struck out. the material deposed in the affidavit of [mr ranwick] of 29 september 2022 contains disputed facts, of which only probative and direct evidence from dcj can resolve. this evidence is not currently before the court. the material contained in his affidavit is mostly hearsay and therefore inadmissible pursuant to rule 15.13 of the family law rules 2004. the father, [mr ranwick], maintains the belief the mother is in a relationship. this is not the case, the mother is single and lives alone. the mother's solicitor withdrew on 14 september 2022, giving the mother one day notice she was withdrawing. there has been no handover of the matter. the fathers assert there is no material change which will meet the threshold in the rule of rice & asplund. outline of contentions threshold has been met by the following, material change in mother's living circumstances despite canvassing a myriad of options to relocate to the [city ab] district so the orders of 30 june 2020 can be effected, the mother has been unable to procure accommodation. in order to be housed through [city ab] housing, the mother has been advised by [mr ao], senior gateway practitioner of [city ab] housing that she would need to be in [city ab] and therefore homeless in order to be linked in with an emergency accommodation provider for temporary housing. it is not in the children's best interest for the mother to be homeless as this would place the children at risk by virtue of the mother's unstable living arrangements in the [city ab] district. the mother has a stable home and employment in [region ap]. the mother is employed as the [administrative officer] for a [primary industry] company and has long-term employment available to her in the area of her expertise. the mother is residing in [region ap], where she hails from, and has strong support networks, including her biological family. (mrr v gr) the mother has been placed on a waiting list with [city ab] housing however has been advised by the department the waiting list is many years long. the mother has had difficulty in obtaining private rentals due to the cost of rent in the [city ab] district, and is not able to secure employment in the [city ab] district without a place of residence. it is not available to the mother to continue her current employment from the [city ab]. it is not in [b] and [d]'s best interest for the mother to continue to sit on a long waiting list in the hope she may be accommodated with potentially many years lapsing in the intervening period. as it is, 2 years have already lapsed and this has impacted the relationship between the siblings and their mother, and their relationship with one another. the mother has been making frequent trips to [city ab], which is approximately [hundreds of kilometres], to attend open homes and meetings with service providers in attempts to procure accommodation. the mother has kept both fathers informed of her difficulty with obtaining accommodation in the [city ab] district, including surrounding suburbs. following being vacated from the crisis house in [town r], despite dcj writing a support letter in 2021 for the mother and the children to be placed in accommodation in the [town bbb] district, the mother is still on the waiting list. the fathers maintain the mother could live elsewhere in the [approx.] 200km range to [town e], however it is unreasonable the mother should live in a town outside of the [city ab] district as this will still force the separation of the siblings, [b] and [d]. under the current orders, [b] is only to live with her mother and sister if the mother is residing in the [city ab] district. the ongoing impact on the children due to their separation from each other and their mother, who has been their primary attachment figure since birth, is detrimental to their overall wellbeing and also would warrant a child impact report. the last family report was conducted more than 3 years ago. [d] is now 5 and [b] is now 12 and both girls are able to articulate their wants. material change in [mr solberg's] living circumstances the first applicant father, [mr solberg], separated from [ms w] in or around may 2020 and materially changed [b]'s living arrangements. the child, [b] is aged 12 and has been subjected to a sudden material change in her living arrangements where, [b] indicated the same day she vacated [ms w]'s house, where she had lived for approximately 2 years, moved to her father's house and met his new girlfriend. [b] has stated she's very confused at how her dad had a new girlfriend so suddenly. [b] has stated she is uncomfortable with the changes in her father's life. [b] has recently become pubescent and has stated to a teacher at school \"i just want to be with my mum\". the physical needs of [b] have changed and thus goes to the threshold. (see s 68 f family law act 1975. [mr solberg] states in his affidavit that [b] has lived with just him before. he refers to a period in early 2019 when [b] was ordered to live with [mr solberg] pending my return to the [town e] area. i returned to the area within approximately 2 weeks and the orders provided for [mr solberg] to return [b] to my care (18 january 2019). instead, he refused and withheld [b] from seeing her then 18 month old sister and mother for a period of 7 weeks, notwithstanding i was complying with orders and had returned. [mr solberg] has demonstrated his ongoing unilateral decision making in opposition to s65dac family law act 1975, outside of the orders and those of which are not in [b]'s best interest. [mr solberg] has repeatedly demonstrated he will unilaterally decide how the orders should read. it has been observed and experienced by the mother that [mr solberg] has: - withheld [b] in september 2021 from spending time with her sister and me, despite there being orders in place, and relying on covid, knowing the court's position with relation to covid and the need for orders to be complied with (no party had covid, [mr solberg] was relying on the [city ab] lockdowns). covid, as an excuse relied upon by [mr solberg] to circumvent [b] spending time with her mother and sister, did not prevent him from seeking orders in april 2020 that [b] spend time with him, notwithstanding covid, - unilaterally interpreting the orders with relation to [b]'s school enrolment being his decision, - unilaterally deciding not to engage [b] in the recommended counselling following her disclosing being sexually abused by a female student, which was investigated by her school, and saying to [b] \"it's no big deal what happened, just get over it\". the department of communities & justice (dcj) ([ms aq]) have indicated to me today that they are preparing a section 248 notice because of concerns about misinformation by [mr ranwick] and the level of harm that appears to be facilitated by him and his partner, [ms an], following spurious unsubstantiated allegations the child, [d], was sexually abused whilst in the mother's care. dcj have confirmed by telephone conversation that allegations made by [mr ranwick]\u2019s partner, [ms an], of [d] being sexually abused in the mother\u2019s care, have not and will not be substantiated. it has been stated to the mother that [mr ranwick] and [ms an] are not happy that sexual abuse hasn't been substantiated and it is argued that unsubstantiated child sex abuse \"does not suit their narrative\". it is understood that [mr ranwick] and [ms an] have made a complaint to dcj regarding the investigation of the allegations brought by [ms an] and the practise of the caseworkers, [ms aq] and [ms ar]. it is understood that after a review of the complaint, [ms aq] and [ms ar]'s investigation has been found to be thorough. it is envisaged this will be clarified in the s 248 paper being completed by dcj legal team. it was indicated to the mother by [ms aq] on 29 september and reiterated today that dcj would consult their internal legal team for further advice with relation to providing their evidence to the court at a later date. it would be prudent for this material to be before the court when it is fully reviewed. steps have been taken by the father [mr ranwick] that are in excess of professional recommendation, despite there being no substantiation of sexual abuse, [mr ranwick] has booked [d] in to see a sexual abuse counsellor on 19 october 2022. dcj has stated to me today in a telephone conversation that [d] does not have a referral for such sex assault counselling and it will not proceed. [mr ranwick] asserted to the mother in a message on 28 september 2022 at 10:32am that \u2018as per recommendation from joint child protection team\u2019 [d] has been on a wait list. a copy of this message is sought to be tendered. of the understanding that dcj weren\u2019t substantiating sexual assault, the mother contacted dcj on 29 september 2022 to seek clarification. the mother was advised that information stated in [mr ranwick]\u2019s correspondence was a \u201cblatant lie\u201d and dcj had suggested that there is benefit in [mr ranwick] and [ms an] engage with their own counselling. if [d] is presented by [mr ranwick] and [ms an] to a sexual abuse counsellor for something that dcj has not and will not recommend and the preception [sic] of such a fixed view is not in [d]\u2019s best interests. it is submitted that children of [d]\u2019s age are highly suggestable, and that repeated questioning can focus attention on the issue about which the child is questioned. in circumstances where dcj and police have not substantiated sexual abuse, [mr ranwick] and [ms an] engaging [d], and seemingly somewhat eagerly, with a sexual assault counsellor exposes d to risk of significant psychological harm. it is further submitted that given dcj and police didn\u2019t substantiate sexual assault, it is entirely plausible for the court to consider [mr ranwick] is seeking to engage [d] in sexual assault counselling motivated solely by his desire to seek evidence of false allegations, particularly where he has engaged on what can be described as a tirade of complaints in an attempt to ensure sexual abuse is substantiated. [d] is currently in the care of her mother in accordance with the orders. she is settled and happy and her environment is familiar. she has a kindergarten she can attend which is situated approximately 100m from our home and she can commence grade prep at the local primary school in 2023, which is across the laneway from our backyard. the school available to the children is a prep - year 12 (p-12) inclusive school, which the sisters can attend together. it is strongly submitted that if [d] returns to [mr ranwick]\u2019s primary care, there is a very real risk she will be exposed to further ongoing harm. the only way this can be ameliorated is by [d] remaining in the primary care of her mother. the child, [d], who is aged 5, spent 6 months without spending substantial or significant time with her mother and sister (she spent a total of 26 hours in 6 months) due to the applicant father, [mr ranwick], unilaterally withholding [d] without reasonable grounds, including police and dcj telling the father on 8 july (the day before he was due to hand [d] over) that they were not substantiating the alleged sexual abuse brought by [ms an], that [d] was not at risk in the mother's care and that they did not direct him to withhold [d]. discussions had with dcj have indicated to the mother that on 8 july, dcj and police did not instruct that [mr ranwick] not hand [d] over the following day. the advice provided to the father on 6 july 2022 was superseded with the advice on 8 july that [d] was safe in my care and could be brought over for contact the following day. it is submitted there is a very real risk the father, [mr ranwick], will continue to circumvent the relationship between [d], her mother and sister. it should also be noted that the mother is a self-represented lay-person who has just picked up the matter. the mother's legal representation withdrew on 14 september 2022, with the mother being informed the day prior. the mother has had limited time to prepare. this is impeded by being served multiple documents by the fathers' solicitor in the past week. further, the mother currently has [b] and [d] in her care in accordance with the orders and by virtue of being unrepresented, has been forced to spend time away from the children. this is not in their best interest that the little time they get with their mother and each other is impacted. further, i was not made aware by my former solicitor of the requirement in accordance with the orders of 5 may 2022 that i was to file written submissions. noting his honour's email of even date, i have put this together as best and as quickly as i can given the limitations. the fathers assert there is no material change which will meet the threshold in the rule of rice & asplund. i submit the rice & asplund threshold has been met on multiple grounds of significant change of circumstances. living situation b) seek to relocate due to circumstances c) orders are unworkable and do not reflect the actual arrangements of the children d) a substantial time has passed e) [mr solberg] has re-partnered and there is material change f) the children have issues of struggling, equal shared parental responsibility is poorly managed, and [b] is older wanting her wishes acknowledged. a) there has been a material change in circumstances to the living arrangements of the respondent mother following forced vacation of the crisis house in [town r] in july 2021 and the ongoing inability to obtain a residence in the [city ab] region to comply with orders of 30 june 2020, b) the current orders of 30 june 2020 do not provide for the children to have a meaningful relationship with their mother and each other, c) the applicant fathers are acting in opposition with s.65dac(1)(b),

against that, one must balance the other consideration, and that is, that the circumstances of children, generally speaking, are likely to change as those children grow up, and their psychological and physical needs change from time to time. in the circumstances of this particular case, the relevant date to look at as to when the court must determine whether or not it was appropriate to reconsider the issue of access, was the date when the proceedings came on for hearing before her honour on 23 june 1987, rather than the institution of proceedings on 9 november 1984. had the issue been raised then, in some way or another, a totally different situation might well have arisen.' authorities relied upon, mrr v gr [2010] hca 4, 240 clr 461, 84 aljr 220, 263 alr 368, (2010) flc 93\u2013424, 42

paragraphs, 214, 220, 226, 371, s68f (1)(2)(c ) (i)(ii)(d)(g)(i) family law act 1975 (cth) cover letter regarding filing of the submissions the father\u2019s submission was filed at 4.03pm on 15 december 2022 and is therefore taken to be filed on the next business day (16 december 2022) on the same day as his honour\u2019s chambers hearing to decide this matter. it is noted that at the time of preparing these submissions, the respondent father has not served me with same. i was alerted to such by logging onto the commonwealth courts portal at approximately 5:20pm. if his submission is accepted by the honourable court, i request the same procedural fairness be applied to my submission that it also be taken to be filed on 16 december 2022. it is noted the father has filed late previously with impunity (order 4 of his honour of 14 september 2022). i therefore submit my submission pursuant to the orders of his honour judge neville made 25 november 2022, and a reply submission to the father provided within the same document. cover letter regarding filing of [mr ranwick]\u2019s new application 15 december 2022 today at 1:05pm, i sought the [city ab] registry file a recovery order and affidavit for [d] to be returned to my care forthwith, and this was stamped as received on 15 december 2022, and they stated it would be provided to chambers. i am very concerned that when i logged onto the portal to file this submission that [mr ranwick] filed an application and supporting affidavit at 5:55pm, which has not been served. i say he has done so because he is aware i am now permanently residing in the [city ab] and [d] is to live with me pursuant to the final orders. it is supported in the dcj report that [mr ranwick] seeks for me to have minimal contact with [d]. he has had over a year to bring a change of circumstance application, and this was indeed foreshadowed by her honour judge hughes in december 2020. on 24 november 2022, in the hearing before his honour neville j. in the opening of proceedings, his honour stated words to the effect of: \u201cas a matter of procedural fairness it is not appropriate for anything to be filed so late, and especially in a matter that is part heard. it is procedurally unfair on the respondent, and it's equally unfair on the court.\u201d his honour also canvassed the following scenario: \u201cif i, or both of the respondents, i suggest [ms markwell] had filed an affidavit of any length, but especially of the length that was filed yesterday, you would rightly be very concerned about not having had proper opportunity in order to consider and deal with it. would you accept that as a proposition?\u201d. as his honour rejected the filing of my affidavit of 23 november 2022 on these exact grounds, it is required his honour reject the 40-page affidavit of the father filed at 5:55pm 15 december 2022 on the night before this hearing. if his honour even so much as views the father\u2019s affidavit, which has not been served on me, he must adopt my affidavit lodged at the registry at 1:05pm 15 december 2022 accompanying the recovery order application. i seek this recovery order application be heard post-haste. written submissions of [ms markwell] in respect of orders of his honour judge neville made 24 november 2022 this matter is a matter of contravention of [mr ranwick] in respect of failing to provide [d] to my care during the 2022 july holidays pursuant to final orders made by her honour judge hughes. the additional evidence in respect of the contravention, which is before the court, is contained in the report provided by the department of communities and justice (\u201cdcj\u201d) on 22 november 2022. that report is to form the basis of this submission. the report was provided in a highly redacted manner, and in what i strongly assert was at the request of the respondent father, without any hearing, and there may be further redacted evidence in the dcj report that should form part of this submission. i say, i am within my right to see all of that document so i may know of, respond to, and properly manage the risks associated with [d]\u2019s wellbeing in the respondent\u2019s care. cross examination of [mr ranwick] admissions made by [mr ranwick] during cross examination include: [mr ranwick] did not hand [d] into my care pursuant to orders on 9 july 2022 [mr ranwick] advised me on the morning of 9 july 2022 that [d] was unwell and did not provide me with details of the illness. [mr ranwick] admitted [d] was not unwell on 9 july 2022. mr ranwick admitted [ms as] (solicitor) told him to inform me [d] was unwell. [mr ranwick] made sexual abuse allegations against my former partner, [mr ag]. [mr ranwick] admitted to presenting [d] to the [town ee] child abuse unit on 8 july 2022. [mr ranwick] admitted that he held no probative evidence of sexual harm towards [d]. [mr ranwick] did not inform me of the allegations before the report was made to dcj. [mr ranwick] conceded he had not made any application for a variation of final orders to the court to request a change to final orders. denials made by [mr ranwick] during cross examination include: [mr ranwick] had been advised on 8 july 2022 by dcj and police that [d] was safe to return to my care, and any withholding of [d] would be a matter for him to decide. evidence that [mr ranwick] made a direct lie and committed perjury to the court is supported by the email of 15 august 2022 from dcj to the mother and provided to the court in accordance with his honour\u2019s orders of 24 november 2022, and also found in the dcj report at [25] on page 23 of 25. \u201c[ms an] and [mr ranwick] chose to withhold [d] from attending her mother\u2019s home for court ordered visitation on the 9th july 2022 despite being told on the 8th july by police and dcj that [d] could go to the arranged visitation. despite [ms markwell] making multiple attempts to facilitate contact with [d] since then [mr ranwick] and [ms an] have not agreed, justifying their decisions with minor reasons and not acting in line with [d]'s best interest. [mr ranwick] and [ms an] have expressed they will be seeking further orders through family law court asking for supervised contact between [ms markwell] and [d], further impacting on the relationship [d] has with her biological mother.\u201d [mr ranwick] denies it is appropriate to advise me of details of illness related to [d] [mr ranwick] denies it is appropriate to advise me of sexual abuse allegations related to [d] where he makes such allegations against third parties whilst she is in my care. reasonable risk of harm admissions made by [mr ranwick] during cross examination include an admission that he did not at any time advise his friend, and [b]\u2019s father [mr solberg], that there were allegations of sexual abuse by [mr ag] against [d]. he failed to do so knowing [b] was at that time in my care. i submit this demonstrates [mr ranwick] to be fabricating his allegations, as, if he had genuine concerns, he would have prevented [b] from also being in my care by advising [mr solberg] of such. submissions on the cross examination evidence [mr ranwick] held the view that [d] was at risk in my care, despite being told by dcj and nsw police on 8 july 2022 that there was nothing to indicate [d] was not safe in my care, and therefore handover should occur. this is substantiated by the email provided to the court and respondent\u2019s solicitor on 24 november 2022 in accordance with his honour\u2019s orders and in the dcj report at [25] page 23 of 25, [mr ranwick], on 9 july 2022 consciously decided to contravene the orders of her honour judge hughes and refused to hand [d] into my care, it is therefore reasonable to conclude [mr ranwick] purposely and wilfully withheld [d] without reasonable ground and purely as a means to circumvent [d] having a meaningful relationship with me. (dcj report at [25] on page 23-24 of 25 \u201c[d]\u2019s future level of risk has been identified as moderate. continuing flc proceedings, and plans for the orders to be changed to allow for [d] to have supervised contact with [ms markwell] will have a detrimental impact on [d]. [d] continues to be subject to an unhealthy relationship between [ms markwell] and both [mr ranwick] and [ms an], with [mr ranwick] and [ms an] expressing that they are wanting [d] to have minimal contact with her mother. this is not considered in the best interest of [d].\u201d [mr ranwick] did not seek to make application to the court for a variation to orders based on rice v asplund change of circumstance, given the severity of the allegations. this would have been the appropriate course of action, noting he is legally represented by highly competent counsel. i submit i have attempted to avoid further litigation by moving to [city ab] in line with the risks identified by dcj. i submit [mr ranwick] is seeking to agitate further proceedings contrary to the advice of dcj, who have identified this would be a risk to [d]\u2019s wellbeing. reply submission in respect of [mr ranwick]\u2019s submission lodged 15 december 2022 at 4:03pm, taken to be filed 16 december 2022. the father claims the sole task of this court was to determine that the withholding of [d] by [mr ranwick] was reasonable in the circumstances. [mr ranwick] admitted in cross examination he held no probative evidence of sexual harm towards [d] therefore the excuse purported by [mr ranwick] cannot possibly be found to be reasonable, as no court could ever test the allegations without probative evidence. therefore, the court\u2019s sole task in determining whether the excuse offered by [mr ranwick] was reasonable, respectfully, cannot possibly be found. the father submits at [14] the circumstances and factors find substantive corroboration in the material provided by dcj. he has not particularised this claim in any way. he states the material is relevant in that it goes directly to the truthfulness of the manner in which [mr ranwick] says he formed the view to withhold [d], however, this cannot be possibly found on the basis that on 8 july 2022, [mr ranwick] was informed by both police and dcj as reported at [25] on page 23-24 of the dcj report. \u201c[ms an] and [mr ranwick] chose to withhold [d] from attending her mother\u2019s home for court ordered visitation on the 9th july 2022 despite being told on the 8th july by police and dcj that [d] could go to the arranged visitation. if the fathers conduct - which i submit is wilful and engineered to circumvent [d]\u2019s relationship with me - is treated with impunity, there is a very real risk his conduct will continue and the court would be setting a dangerous precedent for all to follow. it is therefore submitted that when it comes to making penalty, this court must impose serious consequences to prevent any further misconduct. the orders i seek, therefore, should be granted and penalty determined by this honourable court commensurate with the deliberate nature of [mr ranwick]\u2019s actions in causing harm to [d] and serious psychological and economic consequences on myself. further relevant notes (due to in chambers hearing on 16 december 2022 to be held in absence of parties) further affected time with [d] it should be noted by this honourable court, [mr ranwick] only provided time for me in september 2022, i say, to attempt to make my contravention filed 22 july 2022 futile. had this contravention not been filed, [d] would not have been provided to me in the september school holidays, and [mr ranwick] would have continued to contravene orders with impunity. this is supported by the evidence in the dcj report at [25] where he admitted to dcj he seeks to minimise [d]\u2019s time with me. this is direct evidence of [mr ranwick]\u2019s true intention, to remove the relationship between myself and [d] (which also directly affects [b]), based on his own vexatious intentions towards me, in the worst interests of [d] and [b]. it is noted the dcj report supports that both [mr ranwick] and his partner, [ms an], do not have [d]\u2019s best interest in mind. relocation due to risk of harm to [d] by [mr ranwick], and financial consequences it should also be noted by this honourable court, purely due to the spurious and unsubstantiated sexual abuse allegations against my previous partner [mr ag] , evidenced in the dcj report, and a finding by dcj that [d] is at risk of harm by [mr ranwick] and [ms an] in respect of my relationship with [d] also evidenced in the dcj report, on 9 october 2022 i relocated to [city ab], initially in temporary accommodation (primarily in [town ad], in which details were provided to the father via talking parents app, which he acknowledged was the \u201c[location at]\u201d on 29/10/2022). my costs involved in the relocation have so far been in the vicinity of $7,000 for transitional accommodation and lease establishment costs on the house in [suburb ak]. i now reside in a leased 3-bedroom property facilitated by [organisation au] with a lease signed on 9 december 2022. the only way i could protect [d] from the risk of harm substantiated by dcj was if i was residing in the [city ab], hence my swift relocation to the [city ab] only four days after the hearing in october 2022. despite this relocation and the final orders now being active for [d] to remain in my primary care, [mr ranwick] still, despite the evidence in the dcj report demonstrating me to be of no risk of harm to [d] (including to his relationship with her), has failed to provided [d] back into my care. hence today i sought a recovery order. recovery order provided to the court registry on 15 december 2022 at 1:05pm this evidence is in the affidavit sworn 15 december 2022 received by the [city ab] registry on 15 december 2022, which further references evidence filed in affidavit on 23 november 2022. i was advised by the registry the material would be sent to chambers for review and i would be notified by email. i am concerned the evidence is being concealed from coming before the court \u2013evidence which i say further substantiates the risk posed to [d] by [mr ranwick] and [ms an] and must come before the judge immediately and be reviewed in light of the orders sought in this application and the rice v asplund application, for the protection of [d] and her sister [b]. the affidavit of 23 november 2022 was served on [mr ranwick] on 23 november 2022 and he has had ample time to review that affidavit and file a response with this court. i am very concerned that when i logged onto the portal to file this submission that [mr ranwick] filed an application and supporting affidavit at 5:55pm, which has not been served. i say he has done so because he is aware i am now permanently residing in the [city ab] and [d] is to live with me pursuant to the final orders. it is supported in the dcj report that [mr ranwick] seeks for me to have minimal contact with [d]. he has had over a year to bring a change of circumstance application, and this was indeed foreshadowed by her honour judge hughes in december 2020. further written submission of [ms markwell] in respect of orders of his honour judge neville made 15th december 2022. analysis of dcj report there is no evidence in the dcj report that the mother is a risk of any harm, including sexual harm, to either of her children. the mother is deemed not to be a risk to her daughter [d] in this assessment period. there is substantiated evidence [mr ranwick] and his partner [ms an] present a risk of emotional and psychological harm in this assessment period towards [d]. dcj have substantiated [mr ranwick] and his partner continue to seek to sever the relationship between [d] and her mother, and this would cause significant harm to [d]. furthermore, the report identifies [mr ranwick] and [ms an] simply refuse to take advice of police and dcj in relation to facilitating a relationship between [d] and her mother, and continue to perceive the mother as a risk of harm to [d], where such harm is unsubstantiated after extensive investigation by dcj. they have demonstrated they will continue to withhold [d] from the care of her mother and are willing to breach family court orders in order to achieve a severing of the mother-daughter relationship. most importantly, this is the third claim [mr ranwick] has made of sexual risk of harm towards [d] by the mother and her family and friends: allegations the maternal grandmother is a sexual abuser made by [ms an] in 2021 at [town r] service station, in the presence of d \u2013 recorded in audio, available to the court. allegations the mother\u2019s former partner, [mr ag], is a sexual abuser where the dcj report demonstrates him to be safe with all checks on all systems and to be in possession of a current working with children card. in a message from [mr ranwick] on the talking parents app, contained in the mother\u2019s affidavit, accusing the mother of taking photos for her own sexual gratification \u2013 thereby directly accusing the mother of being a sexual abuser. it is clear [mr ranwick] and his partner will continue to make false allegations against any person, provided it gives them a reason to withhold [d] from her mother\u2019s care. non workability of current orders orders of 30 june 2020 (the final orders) sole parental responsibility for the mother in respect of [d] is required due to high conflict with [mr ranwick]. there is no prospect for a positive co-parenting relationship. it is not in [d]\u2019s best interest to be subjected to the high conflict. it is not in [d]\u2019s best interest to be subjected to the ongoing conflict and [mr ranwick] has demonstrated since the final orders he is an antagonist. he was counselled by then icl during cross examination over his behaviour, to which he stated he \u2018wouldn\u2019t do that anymore\u2019 (p146, l10 \u2013 35 of transcript of 11.10.2019) yet, in the entire time since the final orders his behaviour has continued and escalated, as has been identified by dcj and outlined in their report. it is inconceivable that [d] attend visits with [mr ranwick] from 10am wednesday \u2013 4pm sunday each alternate week when she is attending school. the trial judge did not make any allowances for this. therefore, there must be a change otherwise the mother faces risk of contraventions by the father if she doesn\u2019t comply with orders. the mother will not jeopardise [d]\u2019s education. it is unlikely [mr ranwick] would want to relocate to the [city ab] and give up his employment, support systems, home, and this is the only way the current orders in relation to [d] spending time from 10am wednesday \u2013 4pm sunday each alternate week could occur. therefore, it is submitted this needs to materially change. the father, [mr ranwick], cannot agree on anything proposed by the mother yet, expects her to agree on everything put by him. if the matter is re-opened, evidence will be adduced to demonstrate precisely how uncooperative the father is towards the mother. orders made on 7 august 2020, made only some 5 weeks after the final orders, were referred to by her honour herself as \u2018interim orders\u2019. with relation to the orders requiring permission of the other parties to travel interstate, it is more than reasonable to conclude this was punitive to the mother as she is the only one with meaningful connections in victoria. in any case, with this requirement in place with a high conflict parent, it is certain this will always end up in court as there is a real risk [mr ranwick] will not permit the mother to travel with the children (in this case, [d]). the iccpr requires freedom of movement as a human right, and is enshrined in the constitution. [b]'s voice has not been heard in relation to her wish to live with her mother and see her father. it has been over 3 years since the last family report and both girls\u2019 needs have changed. [b] is now entering the teen years and requires her mother to guide her through the female changes she will face with her body and emotions into adulthood. further, the sisters would benefit greatly from living together, particularly in circumstances where they are attending schools close by (approximately 300m apart). their bond, which is the primary sibling bond, was greatly affected by virtue of the final orders. there is a required discharge of publication orders of reasons for judgment of hughes j. the reasons for judgment of hughes j in markwell & solberg & anor (no.3) [2021] fcca 812 at [10] states: more controversially, on 7 august 2020 i made an order that, in the event any of the parents made a notification to the police or a child protection agency in relation to either of the children, they were required to also provide to the police or child protection authority a copy of the orders and reasons for decision dated 30 june 2020 and a copy of the orders of 7 august 2020. this was because, in the period of a little over five weeks between the judgment on 30 june 2020 and when the matter came before me on 7 august 2020, there had been another notification made by the mother to a doctor who, in turn, made a report to a child protection agency. the orders i made did not prevent any child protection agency from investigating any future notifications but gave them the benefit of a broader perspective given the reasons for decision dealt in detail with numerous previous notifications made directly or indirectly by the mother to child protection agencies, none of which were substantiated. the trial judge describes this as \u2018controversial\u2019. the trial judge placed no weight on the many vexatious and frivolous complaints made by the father and made no judgment in relation to his conduct, as outlined in the mother\u2019s affidavit and canvassed in recent appearances before his honour. it is my respectful submission the order was made with intent to be punitive to the mother and to make her seem non-credible to the respective agencies, colouring their view when making assessments of any real or perceived risk of harm of the children. in contravention of s121 family law act 1975 (cth), both fathers have demonstrated improper use of the rfj for final orders of hughes j to paint the mother in a bad light to external parties, including a doctor\u2019s surgery, the preschool [d] attended, and the primary school [mr ranwick] seeks [d] to attend in [town e]. further, [mr ranwick], in contravention of s121 provided the reasons for judgment to [ms an], who then used a part of the rfj to attempt to fracture my relationship with my mother. this was detailed in my affidavit filed march 2021, and the affidavit of [ms av]. this would place an unnecessary strain on the mother\u2019s ability to communicate with the school and properly attend to [d]\u2019s educational needs if she were to attend primary school in [town e], as reputational damage has already proven to have been caused by the publication of the rfj by [mr ranwick]. as it is, [ae school] will not communicate with the mother and the mother has not been made aware, by the school or [mr ranwick], any details of [d]\u2019s schooling in [town e] save for she had attended a transitional day. [d]\u2019s attendance at [aw school] in the [city ab], nearest to [b]'s school ([af school]), is required to establish a fresh view of the mother at her school without any defamatory material being presented to them to jeopardise her relationship with the school. costs of relocation and ongoing cost of living in the [city ab] due to all of these factors, and despite the mother\u2019s place of work being in [town ax], victoria, and the loss of 50% of her work hours (causing a 50% pay reduction) as well as a promotion, she has relocated to the [city ab] in compliance with orders of hughes j to ensure the safety and wellbeing of both daughters, such that [d] can be in her primary care throughout all of her schooling, and [b] is well supported throughout all of her schooling and has the restoration of the mother/daughter bond, which was her primary bond since birth and the bond with her only sibling. it is therefore likely an application for spousal maintenance will be required to maintain her living in the [city ab] to compensate for her income losses caused by the orders sought by both fathers for her to reside in the [city ab] district. no application for variation of orders made by [mr ranwick] for 11 months [mr ranwick] did not seek to make application to the court for a variation to orders based on rice v asplund change of circumstance, given the severity of the allegations he made about the alleged sexual abuse of [d] by the mothers previous partner. this would have been the appropriate course of action, noting he is legally represented by highly competent counsel. instead, despite being advised by dcj and police on 8 july 2022 (the day before handover) that there was no reason from their view to withhold [d], he chose to withhold her from the mother for a period of almost 6 months. this afforded [mr ranwick] adequate time to file the necessary application with the court, however instead, he launched a litany of complaints which were subjected to internal reviews of dcj. [mr ranwick] was put on notice by hughes j on 17 december 2020 that he would need to file an application if he sought a change to the orders in circumstances where the mother resided in a place other than what is required of her in the orders. therefore, he has been afforded due process and is aware of the correct process. his honour cannot be satisfied his conduct in responding to my applicaiton 11 months later is plausible in these circumstances. weight must be applied to the likeliness of [mr ranwick]\u2019s response at a time that the mother secured accommodation in the [city ab], and thus, he is satisfied the mother is permanently residing in the [city ab]. [mr ranwick] has only recently provided such response after the mother moved to the [city ab] to be in compliance with orders of hughes j, such that the final orders return [d] to her primary care, and it is submitted this is not in line with his agenda, and it is supported by dcj that he seeks that [d] have minimal contact with her mother, which dcj have stated is not in [d]\u2019s best interest and would be harmful to her. avoidance of further litigation all parties admit there has been no change of circumstance on those facts at the original trial which would allow the father to reopen litigation in the matter. the mother is living in [city ab] in compliance with the orders. during the hearing on 20 december 2022, his honour foreshadowed to the effect of the father could not argue a change of circumstances where the orders contemplate the mother living in the [city ab]. equally, there is no ability for [mr ranwick] to attempt to coerce the mother to be the \u201capplicant\u201d in any reopening of proceedings by the father, as such would be his application and would subject him to all costs pursuant to s117(2) of the family law act. if proceedings were reopened, a barro or hogan order would be sought that [mr ranwick] pay upfront for the cost of the mother\u2019s representation and senior counsel for the entirety of proceedings, ancillary expenses, and the full cost of loss of her work hours. the mother submits she has attempted to avoid further litigation by moving to [city ab] in line with the risks identified by dcj and in compliance with hughes j orders. notwithstanding the mother\u2019s right to freedom of movement, as supported by the constitution and other authorities already submitted to this honourable court, recently franklyn & franklyn [2019] famcafc 256 (23 december 2019), the mother has settled into the [city ab] and the children are the direct beneficiaries of the relationship between the children, [b] and [d], and their mother being restored. the mother submits [mr ranwick] is seeking to agitate further proceedings contrary to the advice of dcj, who have identified this would be a risk to [d]\u2019s wellbeing. this demonstrates [mr ranwick] lacks insight into [d]\u2019s best interest, whereas the mother relocated to the [city ab] as she accepted that ongoing litigation is not in [d]\u2019s best interest. relocation due to risk of harm to [d] by [mr ranwick], and financial consequences it should also be noted by this honourable court, purely due to the spurious and unsubstantiated sexual abuse allegations against the mother\u2019s former partner, [mr ag], evidenced in the dcj report, and a finding by dcj that [d] is at risk of harm by [mr ranwick] and [ms an] in respect of the mother\u2019s relationship with [d] also evidenced in the dcj report, on 9 october 2022 she relocated to [city ab], initially in temporary accommodation (primarily a motel room in [town ad], in which details were provided to the father via talking parents app, which he acknowledged was the \u201c[location at]\u201d on 29/10/2022). the mother\u2019s costs involved in the relocation have so far been in the vicinity of $12,000 for transitional accommodation and lease establishment costs on the house in [suburb ak]. she now resides in a leased 3-bedroom property facilitated by [organisation u] with a lease signed on 9 december 2022. although this is transitional housing, it was the only way for the mother to be able to relocate to the [city ab]. [organisation u] have stated that the property is available to the mother and her children until such a time that we are able to find a property on the [region ay] of [city ab]. if these proceedings are reopened, sworn evidence from [organisation u] will support that the mother and children are at no risk of being rendered homeless. the mother advised the court the property in [town al] is on the market. she has fully vacated and has no option of returning to live in the area. the court can therefore be satisfied the mother is a permanent resident of the [city ab]. as evidenced in the letter provided to the court in affidavit of the mother from [mr ao] of housing [city ab], the mother had been canvassing accommodation since early july 2020 following the making of the final orders. it must be noted that the mother never \u2018chose\u2019 to be separated from her children and it is unfortunate that by virtue of the orders, the mother has had significant financial burden by the requirement to relocate for her children to remain in her care. the only way she could protect [d] from the risk of harm substantiated by dcj was if she was residing in the [city ab], hence her swift relocation to the [city ab] only four days after the hearing in october 2022. the evidence before the court is that the mother had to be physically in the [city ab] to be assisted by services. despite this relocation and the final orders now being active for [d] to remain in the mother\u2019s primary care, [mr ranwick] still, despite the evidence in the dcj report demonstrating her to be of no risk of harm to [d] (including to his relationship with her), continues to prosecute a return to his care, and continues to claim a risk of harm by the mother towards [d] despite no substantiation by dcj of any such harm. despite the mother relocating to the [city ab] on 9 october 2022, both fathers retained 100% commonwealth benefits for the children, along with being recipients of child support, which is still being deducted from the mother\u2019s salary, despite [b] being in a week about with the mother and [mr solberg]. on or around 12 january, [mr solberg] agreed to both centrelink and child support agency that from 9 december, when the mother signed the lease on the current property in [suburb ak], that the care arrangement for [b] is 50/50 and thus, benefits have been allocated accordingly between [mr solberg] and the mother. it is therefore submitted that by virtue of this, [mr solberg] is satisfied the mother is permanently a resident of the [city ab]. it remains, however, that [mr ranwick] is disputing [d] is living with the mother in [city ab], and has been claiming ongoing ftb and child support, knowing the arrangements for [d] as acknowledged in a letter sent to the mother from his solicitor on 25 january 2022. despite [d] being returned to the mother\u2019s care in accordance with the orders on 23 december 2022, she has not received any allowable entitlement for [d] since 21 september 2021. [mr ranwick] has a current dispute being investigated by centrelink. it is therefore plausible for this court to consider and place strong weight on [mr ranwick]\u2019s financial motivation, particularly considering the evidence that was tested in 2019 where [mr ranwick], under cross examination on 11 october 2019, admitted to not financially supporting the family other than a few groceries here and there. [mr ranwick]\u2019s affidavit of 15 december 2022 evidence can be tendered that disputes what [mr ranwick] has claimed in his affidavit and is consciously misleading this honourable court. the mother has a right to respond in affidavit if the court entertains this evidence of the father. in any case, the mother was living in the [city ab] and [d] was to be living with the mother in accordance with the orders. there was no order prohibiting the mother from collecting [d], which the preschool had noted at the time of [d]\u2019s enrolment in 2021 when [mr ranwick] demanded the preschool prohibit the mother from collecting [d] at any time. an email from the day care can be provided to the court. there is very real risk that if the matter is re-opened to consider [d] living with the father, she will be subjected to ongoing psychological harm of the father and his partner. without the mother being granted sole parental responsibility, there is a very real risk she will continue to be exposed to ongoing harassment by [mr ranwick], which will have an effect on [d] - and [b] by proxy. by virtue of the mother relocating to, and settling in the [city ab], she accepts dcj\u2019s position relating to ongoing litigation not being in [d]\u2019s best interest and does not press to relocate to victoria. costs there is no justifiable reason that the court should make orders for costs in favour of the fathers. by virtue of the orders, the mother has been required to give up employment, relocate numerous times, pay child support to both fathers and both fathers be in receipt of 100% ftb as the mother was only deemed as having 11% care of her children, through no fault of her own, due to the accommodation difficulties she faced for 2 and a half years. it was not in the mother\u2019s control as to when she was accommodated in the [city ab], and the evidence before the court clearly demonstrates the mother did not stop canvassing all options available to her in this time. annexure a: [mr ranwick]\u2019s history of vexatious complaints against the mother to withhold [d] on 7 august 2020, i made submissions to the following effect to then hughes j, with relation to [mr ranwick], supported by transcript, handed her over to the father, he is not doing anything to give her back and he is likely to continue doing this kind of thing at his discretion. there is no reason preventing him from handing [d] back. his demands of a copy of a lease prior to handing [d] back to me and causing his solicitor to request the same is not in the orders. i tried to arrange [d]\u2019s return to me and [mr ranwick] rang the police and made a vexatious complaint that i was harassing and bullying him, resulting in the police contacting me. there were no charges laid. he sought for someone at nsw health to write him a letter, which he provided to police, stating that [d] must remain isolated with him for a further 14 days. i have not seen this letter naming [d] and it was sought by [mr ranwick] in spite of espr. no such letter or any evidence has been adduced despite the father seeking an adjournment on monday. [mr ranwick] caused the police to investigate me on the 1 august 2020 following complaints that i was harassing and bullying him. in the context of the situation, that being me trying to facilitate the return of [d] to me, the police ceased their investigations into me however acknowledged that [mr ranwick]\u2019s conduct was in breach of family court orders and the family violence intervention order. here we are now, more than 2 years down the track, and [mr ranwick] is continuing with this behaviour. his numerous complaints about the investigation which found he and [ms an] were identified as persons of interest for causing psychological harm to [d] in this assessment period is an example of how far he will go to secure his intended outcome. instead of accepting the outcome, which was subjected to numerous internal reviews by senior members of dcj, he sought to have the findings against he and his partner withdrawn. this poses a significant risk to [d] that he lacks insight into how his and his partners behaviour affects [d], and it is respectfully submitted this demonstrates a man who is more self-focused (as supported by his treating psychiatrist and contained in the subpoenaed material) than it shows a father vested in his daughter\u2019s best interest. this honourable court can accept with ease that [mr ranwick]\u2019s intention is to withhold [d] for no other reason than to alienate me from her. [mr ranwick]\u2019s history of spurious and vexatious complaints against the mother since separation supports that he will go to any length to alienate the mother from their daughter. written

background [ac] law firm act for [mr solberg] (\u201c[mr solberg]\u201d) & [mr ranwick] (\u201c[mr ranwick]\u201d), who are the first and second applicants in the substantive proceedings, but the respondents for the purpose of the extant application. the mother, [ms markwell] (\u201cthe mother\u201d), is the respondent in the substantive proceedings and the applicant in the extant application. she is self-represented. the extant application is the application for contravention filed by the mother on 22 july 2022. the application for contravention was partially determined on 5 october 2022 but was subsequently adjourned part heard. the matter was heard again on 24 november 2022, judgement reserved. on 24 november 2022, his honour judge neville ordered each party to file written submissions as to the relevance of material produced by the department of communities and justice (\u201cdcj\u201d) with respect to the child [d] in relation to the application for contravention, only. dcj material the material produced by dcj goes some way to corroborating the version of events provided by [mr ranwick] in his affidavit filed 29 september 2022. page [3] of the \u201calternate assessment\u201d document reveals that the joint child protection response program (\u201cjcprp\u201d) received three (3) reports between 6 and 7 july 2022 [1 rosh and 2 duplicate] in relation to the child, [d]. the reports contained, inter alia, information that [d]: displayed abnormal behaviour on 6 july 2022 by wetting herself, spoke of there being \u201cscary\u201d things at her mother\u2019s house, was scared of [mr ag], the mother\u2019s then-boyfriend (\u201c[mr ag]\u201d), and answered \u201cyes\u201d when asked if [mr ag] toucher her on her \u201cprivate parts\u201d. the proceeding paragraphs, which are too lengthy to summarise in detail in these brief submissions, reveal that [d] was unable to be engaged by jcprp and did not participate in an electronically recorded interview. the material then goes on to detail the various investigations conducted by dcj and jcprp, ultimately resulting in a finding that the allegations concerning [mr ag] were unable to be substantiated. the mother\u2019s prosecution of her application for contravention at the hearing on 24 november 2022 appeared to be founded on two primary limbs: firstly, that the allegations against [mr ag] were ultimately not substantiated by either jcprp or dcj, and therefore the excuse provided by [mr ranwick] for withholding [d] could not possibly be countenanced as \u201creasonable\u201d. with the greatest of respect to the mother, who is notably self-represented, these limbs are founded in legal error. in this forum, the court is not tasked with making a finding regarding the veracity of [d]\u2019s disclosures, including whether or not [mr ag] assaulted [d]. with [mr ranwick] having conceded withholding [d] in contravention of the orders of 30 june 2020, the court\u2019s sole task is to determine whether the excuse offered by [mr ranwick] is \u201creasonable\u201d. in in the marriage of o\u2019brien [1992] famca 52, (1992) 16 fam lr 723, justice smithers said at 727: \u201c...a reasonable excuse in respect of concern as to the welfare of the child, is limited to a belief, on reasonable grounds, that depriving a person of access pursuant to an order was necessary to protect the health or safety of a person. it is not a question as to whether the view of the custodial parent, or in the view of the custodial parent on reasonable grounds, that the carrying out of the access order might not be in the best interests of the child\u201d. phasis added) the circumstances and factors upon which [mr ranwick] based his decision to withhold [d] from the mother, which he gives in evidence at paragraphs 8 \u2013 10 (inclusive) of his 29 september 2022 affidavit, were not the subject of cross-examination at the hearing of 24 november 2022 and were not otherwise materially challenged. these circumstances and factors find substantive corroboration in the material provided by dcj. the material is relevant in that it goes directly to the truthfulness of the manner in which [mr ranwick] says he formed the view to withhold [d]. [mr ranwick] formed the view, on what is submitted can only be considered \u201creasonable grounds\u201d, that depriving the mother of time with [d] until the substance of [d]\u2019s disclosures could be properly investigated was necessary to protect [d]\u2019s ongoing health and safety. the material provided by dcj speaks to the reasonableness of these grounds, notwithstanding their ultimate finding that the allegations could not be substantiated. background [ac] law firm act for [mr solberg] (\u201c[mr solberg]\u201d) & [mr ranwick] (\u201c[mr ranwick]\u201d), who are the first and second applicants in the substantive proceedings, but the respondents for the purpose of the extant application. the mother, [ms markwell] (\u201cthe mother\u201d), is the respondent in the substantive proceedings and the applicant in the extant application. she is self-represented. on 4 and 5 october 2022, his honour judge neville dealt with two applications brought by the mother, those being: a. the application in a proceeding filed 11 january 2022, and b. the application for contravention filed 22 july 2022. the application in a proceeding was heard on 4 october 2022, judgement reserved. judgement has not yet been delivered. the application for contravention was partially determined on 5 october 2022 but was subsequently adjourned part heard. the matter was heard again on 24 november 2022, judgement reserved. on 24 november 2022, his honour judge neville ordered each party file written submissions as to the relevance of material produced by the department of communities and justice (\u201cdcj\u201d) with respect to the child [d] in relation to the application for contravention, only. those submissions were filed on 15 december 2022. concurrent with those written submissions, [mr ranwick] caused to be filed on his behalf a response and accompanying affidavit to the mother\u2019s application in a proceeding filed 11 january 2022. [mr ranwick] sought, inter alia, to re-open the evidence of the application in a proceeding prior to judgement delivery, citing various evidentiary issues not dealt with when the matter was heard on 4 october 2022. the matter came before his honour judge neville on 20 december 2022. his honour ordered that each party \u201cfile supplementary submissions of no more than 5 pages in length addressing the new material from the department of communities and justice and if any changes should be made to the final orders dated 30 june 2020\u201d. dcj letter \u2013 14 december 2022 on 23 november 2022, the mother caused to be filed an additional affidavit in support of the application for contravention filed 22 july 2022 (\u201cthe november affidavit\u201d). subsequent to objection on behalf of [mr ranwick], his honour judge neville ruled the mother could not rely on the affidavit, \u201cexcept in relation to the determination by the department of communities and justice that there is no relevant risk as determined in relation to the mother\u2019s former partner\u201d. on 14 december 2022, the court received a letter from dcj, specifically [town ee] joint child protection response team (\u201cjcprp\u201d), which sets out their response to a number of factual assertions contained in the november affidavit (\u201cthe dcj letter\u201d). it will not be necessary to detail each and every response provided by dcj in relation to the november affidavit. some of the responses are not materially relevant to the issues presently before the court. to the extent the responses are relevant, they will be addressed intra. at paragraph 16 of the november affidavit, the mother gives evidence that she text messaged [mr ranwick] saying, inter alia, \u201ccan you please advise why you think [d] needs to attend counselling, noting this was not a recommendation of dcj\u201d. the dcj letter responds to this paragraph saying \u201cdcj\u2019s joint child protection response program (jcprp) made a referral for [d]\u2019s father, [mr ranwick] and her stepmother [ms an] to attend generalised counselling for protective behaviours. this counselling is a generalised counselling to assist in teaching parents and children body safety. [ms markwell] also requested she be able to attend this counselling service.\u201d (emphasis added) if the version of events provided by dcj is accepted as true, not only did the mother know dcj recommended generalised counselling for [d], she requested she be able to attend. [mr ranwick] acknowledged that generalised counselling, and not sexual assault counselling, was recommended by dcj in his reply text message to the mother set out at paragraph 17 of the november affidavit, saying \u201cthe sexual assault counsellor is booked for tomorrow in [town ee]. on the basis that generalised counselling is being recommended, i will cancel the appointment in the morning and [d] will be present at [event az]\u201d. at paragraph 24 of the november affidavit, the mother says \u201cthere have been previous mandatory reports made with relation to [d] being a victim of physical abuse in the father\u2019s care, where even the police subpoena issued in april 2022 validated \u2018police do not disagree the child has what appear to be smack marks\u2019. i cannot comment on why judge hughes did not turn her mind to this.\u201d the dcj letter responds to this paragraph saying: \u201cin response to paragraph 24, the previous assessment completed in 2021 did not substantiate physical abuse of [d]\u201d. paragraph 33 of the november affidavit is too long to repeat verbatim in these submissions, but it recounts, in detail, a conversation between the mother and [ms aq] on 28 october 2022. relevantly, the mother says, inter alia \u201cin terms of their assessment, it had been finalised. [mr ranwick] and [ms an] are persons of interest in the risk of psychological harm to [d]\u201d. the letter from dcj says \u201cin response to paragraph 33...[ms markwell] was told all three parental figures had now been listed as poi\u2019s for the substantiation issue due to the ongoing negative relationships and its impact on [d]\u201d. the acknowledgement that the mother has also been identified as a person of interest is not conceded anywhere in her evidence. it is submitted the version(s) of events given in the dcj letter by [ms ba] ought to be accepted by the court. dcj do not have a vested interest in the outcome of this case and volunteered the letter to correct what they allege are factual inaccuracies in the november affidavit. when the november affidavit and the dcj letter are read together, the court will find the mother\u2019s evidence contains a number of factual inaccuracies, some of which are outlined above, which have the fundamental effect of misleading the court. the court will find that the inaccuracies in the november affidavit were by design, intentional, and were undertaken for the express purpose of exaggerating the risk posed by [mr ranwick], and minimising the risk posed by the mother. the court will find that the mother continually referred to the labelling of [mr ranwick] and his partner as \u201cpersons of interest in the risk of psychological harm to [d]\u201d, without once conceding dcj applied the same label to her. the court will find this omission to be a wilful attempt to mislead the court in relation to the dcj findings. the mother gave evidence about the mandatory reports concerning alleged physical abuse by [mr ranwick] but failed to mention that dcj did not substantiate physical abuse. the court will again find the omission of dcj\u2019s ultimate finding to be a wilful attempt to mislead the court in relation to the risk posed to [d] by [mr ranwick]. the misleading tenor of these crucial aspects of the mother\u2019s evidence necessitates the court approach any other evidence given by her with healthy scepticism. the court could not be satisfied the mother has been truthful in any of her evidence, save for that which is capable of being independently corroborated by other evidence available to the court. changes to final orders dated 30 june 2022 this case has a regrettably long and protracted history before this honourable court. the court would be well aware of the history of this matter, including the previously problematic conduct of the mother. the court would be aware the mother was the subject of a vexatious litigant application, which was settled by consent in march 2022 on terms preventing her from bringing any application, except that of contravention, without leave of the court. noting the lengthy history of the matter and the concision presently required, these submissions will concern themselves largely with conduct peripheral to the extant applications before the court, and not otherwise detailed in previous applications. paragraphs 7 through 22 inclusive of [mr ranwick]\u2019s affidavit filed 15 december 2022 (\u201cthe december affidavit\u201d) give a historical account of the difficulties with the mother\u2019s residential address in the [city ab]. in summary, the mother has previously alleged her residential address in the [city ab] was variously a caravan park, a tourist park, and a hotel. all three of these ultimately proved transient residences for a finite period, notwithstanding the mother\u2019s assertions to the contrary. [mr ranwick] alleges the mother\u2019s [city ab] -based transience has also extended to sleeping in her car, a disclosure he alleges was made by [d] on 12 october 2022. on 7 december 2022, there began an exchange between the mother and solicitors for [mr ranwick] in relation to the mother\u2019s living arrangements. the mother disclosed her new residential address was [bc street, suburb ak] [city ab], and that her accommodation was arranged through the [organisation u]. notwithstanding repeated requests, the mother refused to provide a copy of her lease. on 20 december 2022, his honour judge neville ordered the mother to disclose a copy of her lease. a review of the lease, or \u201coccupancy agreement\u201d, reveals that it is an \u201coccupancy agreement for emergency accommodation for people in crisis\u201d and that the term of the occupancy agreement concludes on 8 june 2023. until the disclosure of the lease, the mother had not made the court or [mr ranwick] aware that the accommodation was temporary crisis accommodation. it is submitted that the mother took active steps to obfuscate the finite nature of her accommodation, and the limited-term lease represents a continuation of the previous residential transience she has been party to in trying to secure [d] in her full time care. there is a lacuna in the mother\u2019s evidence before the court about what is likely to happen if she is unable to secure accommodation past 8 june 2023. the mother has spoken repeatedly, both in court and in her evidence, of the extreme difficulty she has previously encountered in securing accommodation in the [city ab]. there is no evidentiary basis to suggest she will not be subjected to the same adversity at the conclusion of her current occupancy agreement. on the operation of the current orders and presupposing the mother does as she has done previously and returns to [town al] if she is unable to find additional accommodation in the [city ab], [d] will return to the care of [mr ranwick] in [town e], nsw. the court will find that, given the mother is residing in crisis accommodation, there is real possibility this will occur if the orders are not changed. noting that [d] is now of school age, such instability and unpredictability in her living arrangements have real consequences to both her development and her schooling. such consequences are not in [d]\u2019s best interests. [mr ranwick] has been [d]\u2019s resident parent and primary carer since september 2021. [mr ranwick] has a stable and loving relationship with his partner, [ms an]. in 2021, [mr ranwick] and [ms an] had a son, [bd], [d]\u2019s half-brother. [d] is enrolled at [ae school] which is due to commence term 1 on 3 february 2023. [d] has previously completed the transition program and is familiar with the school, her peers, and her teacher [ms be]. it is submitted [mr ranwick] has demonstrated himself to be a competent and diligent parent, with stable accommodation, work, and relationship. conversely, it is submitted the mother has demonstrated herself as dishonest, capricious, and prone to continuing conflict. the mother also continues to exhibit a high-handed attitude towards compliance with orders of this court, perhaps best exemplified by her unilateral attempt to remove [d] from day care at about 1:30pm on 6 december 2022, without any notice to [mr ranwick]. during this time, the mother also disseminated a copy of the letter addressed to the registrar of the federal circuit and family court of australia, [city ab] registry, [city ab], which comprised part of the dcj material released by the court after the contravention hearing on 24 november 2022, being the pdf entitled \u201c [d]s248 22.11.22.\u201d. it is [mr ranwick]\u2019s contention that the court, pursuant to s 70nba(1) of the family law act 1975 (cth) should vary the orders of her honour judge hughes dated 30 june 2020 such that: [d] live with [mr ranwick], [mr ranwick] has sole parental responsibility for [d], and whilst ever the mother resides within [several hundred kilometres] of [town e], [d] spend time with her each alternate weekend from the conclusion of school until 5:00pm sunday. count 1: contravention 1 set out in the contravention application filed 22 july 2022 was not admitted and in the alternative was admitted but with reasonable excuse. the court finds that there is no prima facie case established. count 2: contravention 2 set out in the contravention application filed 22 july 2022 was not admitted and in the alternative was admitted but with reasonable excuse. the court finds that there is no prima facie case established. count 5: contravention 5 set out in the contravention application filed 22 july 2022 was not admitted and in the alternative was admitted but with reasonable excuse. the court finds that a prima facie case is established. contravention 3 order 12(b)(iii) of the final orders made on 30 june 2020 9 july 2022 - 10:00am \u2013 [town f] service centre on the [g] highway, [town f] the first respondent without reasonable excuse, failed to facilitate [d] spending time with the applicant. contravention 4 order 13 of the final orders made on 30 june 2020 9 july 2022 - 10:00am - [town f] service centre on the [g] highway, [town f] the first respondent without reasonable excuse, failed to make the child, [d], available at [town f] service centre on the [g] highway, [town f] for changeover. contravention 5 order 19 of the final orders made on 30 june 2020 9 july 2022 \u2013 10:00am - [city ab] the first respondent without reasonable excuse, failed to take all reasonable steps to ensure that the child, [d], spends time with the mother and her sibling, [b] . c. contravention application filed 7th march 2023 contravention 1 order 11 of orders dated 30th june 2020. 44/01/2022 \u2013 4:34am \u2013 [suburb ak], [city ab] the respondent, without reasonable excuse, caused the child [d] to be enrolled in a particular school without consulting the applicant, in circumstances where there is an order or equal shared parental responsibility. the respondent, without reasonable excuse, did not name the applicant as a parent on the enrolment form. contravention 2 order 12.b.i. of orders dated 30 june 2020. 10/02/2022 \u2013 6pm \u2013 [town f] service centre the respondent, without reasonable excuse, failed to facilitate the child [d]\u2019s time with the applicant. contravention 3 order 12.b.i. of orders dated 30 june 2020. 17/02/2022 \u2013 6pm \u2013 [town f] service centre the respondent, without reasonable excuse, failed to facilitate the child [d]\u2019s time with the applicant. contravention 4 order 12.b.i. of orders dated 30 june 2020. 23/02/2022 \u2013 6pm \u2013 [town f] service centre the respondent, without reasonable excuse, failed to facilitate the child [d]\u2019s time with the applicant. evidence in relation to prima facie case of the contraventions now, i\u2019m going to talk to you now about the school enrolment contravention. okay?

[mr bh] asked did i respond to the letter? mr [bh]: yes, that\u2019s what i asked. i said, \u201cyou didn\u2019t respond, did you\u201d?\u2011\u2011\u2011no. no. and you submitted an application, didn\u2019t you, in relation to [aw school]?\u2011\u2011\u2011i submitted an application to both of those schools. yes. and you submitted that application before you actually sent the message to my client, didn\u2019t you?\u2011\u2011\u2011i think i submitted one to [bg school] on 17 january and the one to [aw school] perhaps \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 well, i \u2011 \u2011 \u2011?\u2011\u2011\u2011 \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 on the 23rd or 24th. i\u2019m not asking about [bg school] . i\u2019m asking about [aw school]. when did you submit the one to [aw school]?\u2011\u2011\u2011i think it was either the 23rd or the 24th. i can\u2019t \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 right?\u2011\u2011\u2011 \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 remember off the top of my head. well, fortunately, the application is time-stamped, so i\u2019m just going to show it to you. and you can see there it\u2019s 4.34 am that you submitted it?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. you see that? and that was before you sent the message to my client, isn\u2019t it?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. yes. now, you say you enrolled [d] in [bg school] as well?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes, i did, on the 17th. a copy of that enrolment wasn\u2019t provided to the father, was it?\u2011\u2011\u2011no. and a copy of that enrolment wasn\u2019t provided to my office, was it?\u2011\u2011\u2011no. and a copy of that enrolment is not in evidence, is it?\u2011\u2011\u2011no, it\u2019s not. and [mr ranwick] wasn\u2019t on the [bg school] enrolment, was he?\u2011\u2011\u2011on the [aw school] enrolment? no, on [bg school]?\u2011\u2011\u2011no, he wasn\u2019t. thank you. i will have that back. so just so i understand your evidence you didn\u2019t include him on the [bg school] one either, did you?\u2011\u2011\u2011no, i didn\u2019t. ... his honour: so what does that mean to you that it says \u201cequal\u201d but you can do, really, whatever you think is appropriate at the time?\u2011\u2011\u2011no, that\u2019s not \u2013 not accurate, your honour. well, that\u2019s what i\u2019m asking?\u2011\u2011\u2011well, given the concerns that had transpired with [d]\u2019s preschool and the interference by [mr ranwick] and his partner, as set out in my affidavit that i filed yesterday, it explicitly states that i held concerns over that, and those concerns were very warranted in the phone call that [d]\u2019s school received on 2 march this year from both [mr ranwick] and [ms an]. but we\u2019re talking january and you unilaterally took steps in relation to enrolling [d], firstly, in [bg school] and then, secondly, at [aw school], yes?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes, just as [mr ranwick] had unilaterally enrolled [d] \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 no. sorry. do you understand that it\u2019s not a tit-for-tat exercise and we have to be very focussed upon this application, because i\u2019m reserved on the other applications that you have brought. we just need to be as confined as we possibly can. understand?\u2011\u2011\u2011i think so. ... mr [bh]: you\u2019ve just told the court that the reason you didn\u2019t include the father on the [bg school] application is because you had fears about how he might interfere with [d]\u2019s schooling. do i understand your evidence correctly?\u2011\u2011\u2011not how he would interfere with her schooling, how he would interfere in a way that it \u2013 he would paint me in a bad light to the school, which is exactly what has happened. i see. but that\u2019s not the reason you say you didn\u2019t include him on the enrolment to [aw school]?\u2011\u2011\u2011no. so you had one reason to not include him on the enrolment in relation to [bg school] and one reason in relation to [aw school] ?\u2011\u2011\u2011well, i mean \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 is that right?\u2011\u2011\u2011 \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 it\u2019s across the board for both of the schools. no, no. would you like to answer \u2011 \u2011 \u2011?\u2011\u2011\u2011the concern \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 would you like to answer my question?\u2011\u2011\u2011the concern isn\u2019t discrete to one school. the concern is whether [d] is going to school here or in [town e] or in western australia, the concern remains the same. the reason i didn\u2019t include him on the application to [aw school] is because that would have automatically made him 50 per cent liable for the school fees, which are in excess of $8000 per year, and i was concerned, given the time-critical nature of [d] needing to be enrolled and commenced at a school by 30 january, that he would have held up or delayed the process of her enrolment. by refusing to pay the school fees, that\u2019s what you\u2019re saying?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. well, he indicated to you, didn\u2019t you, that he didn\u2019t agree with [d] attending [aw school] ?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. and he sent you this message: if you cannot enrol [d] in a public school in [city ab], please arrange for [d] to be returned to my care at 10 am on wednesday at [town f] service station. [d] can then commence at [ae school] on friday, 3 february. ?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. and you say that that forms the basis, or a considerable part of the basis, for you contravening the orders?\u2011\u2011\u2011well, it shows he doesn\u2019t have a regard for the orders. no, no. would you like to answer my question?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. yes. his honour: sorry, that\u2019s really the basis, or something similar, for your plea mitigation of reasonable excuse, isn\u2019t it?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes, your honour, it is. mr [bh]: yes. and it says: markwell] was told all three parental figures had now been listed as persons of interest for this substantiation issue, due to the ongoing negative relationships and its impact on [d]. do you see that?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. so what you in fact told the learned deputy registrar wasn\u2019t accurate, was it?\u2011\u2011\u2011in relation to \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 in relation to your interim family violence order against [ms an]?\u2011\u2011\u2011in relation to her conduct, yes, it was. i can\u2019t \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 no. in relation to her being a substantiated risk of harm to [d]?\u2011\u2011\u2011well, yes, it was accurate because she has been identified as a risk of harm \u2013 psychological harm to [d]. well, i put it to you that she hasn\u2019t and i put it to you that this letter demonstrates that she hasn\u2019t. and i also put it to you that the last sentence on the bullet point that i\u2019ve just drawn your attention to suggests that all three parental figures have been listed as persons of interest. now, you didn\u2019t tell the learned deputy registrar that you had been listed as a person of interest, did you?\u2011\u2011\u2011because it wasn\u2019t in relation to the parental conflict. no, no. excuse me?\u2011\u2011\u2011it was in relation discretely to [ms an]\u2019s conduct. would you like to answer my question, which is you didn\u2019t tell them that you were listed as a person of interest, did you?\u2011\u2011\u2011no, because it wasn\u2019t relevant \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 no?\u2011\u2011\u2011 \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 to the application. the application was brought about following the interactions with [aw school] and what [ms an] had \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 i\u2019m aware, [ms markwell]?\u2011\u2011\u2011 \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 told them. but i put it to you that you actually misled deputy registrar [bj] in relation to material facts that she took into consideration in making that interim family violence order?\u2011\u2011\u2011i don\u2019t agree with that. the mother\u2019s written submissions changes to orders both parents seek sole parental responsibility of [d]. this is necessary to protect [d] from ongoing conflict. the father and his partner have both simultaneously made life very difficult for [d] having a relationship with her mother and sister, and there is very real risk this will continue. such is supported by the voice recordings where [ms an] and [mr ranwick] state to [d] they will not give up until she is home. they simply refuse to accept the harm they\u2019re causing to [d] by removing her from her mother and sister\u2019s lives and are clearly intent on exposing her to ongoing litigation (\u201cwe will not give up\u201d). [d] deserves a life away from litigation. this is only achievable if the mother has spr. the mother is not a vexatious litigant. she has always filed where it has been in the children\u2019s best interest. the order of 25 march 2022 must be discharged. the order requiring permission to travel outside of the [city ab]/nsw must be discharged. both fathers previously consented to this, and it must be accepted if this order remains, the mother will regrettably be forced to bring future applications. the mother now permanently resides in the [city ab] and has no intention of relocating. it is unreasonable that she and her daughters be further isolated by not being permitted to visit their friends and family in victoria. just recently, the father denied [d] being permitted to visit her family in sale for the easter holidays. this order gives control to the father and is not supported by a person\u2019s right to freedom of movement, as enshrined in the constitution. further, this order was made around covid, which now has no restrictions or isolation periods imposed. the father\u2019s (mr ranwick\u2019s) submissions the time-based contraventions 1. in relation to what might be described as the \u201ctime-based contraventions\u201d the court will make the following factual findings: on 20 january 2023, [mr ranwick] returned [d] to the mother\u2019s care. noting the intended operation of order 12(b)(i) of orders dated 30 june 2020, that [d] is now of school age, and that the parties reside approximately 100km away from one another, [mr ranwick] caused correspondence to be sent to the mother from his solicitors on 24 january 2023, 6 february 2023, and 10 february 2023, first inviting the mother to propose an alternative arrangement for [d]\u2019s time with [mr ranwick], and thereafter proposing an alternative arrangement in which [d] would spend time with him from friday to sunday, each weekend. no response was received from the mother to all three letters. [mr ranwick] sent multiple messages to the mother by the talkingparents app, requesting she comply with the orders and facilitate [d]\u2019s time with the father, going so far as to say in a message on 23 february 2023 \u201cif there is anything i can do to assist you in facilitating changeover, please advise\u201d. no response was received from the mother to any of the messages. [mr ranwick] attended [town f] service centre on 10, 17, and 24 february 2023. the mother did not attend, and he did not spend time with [d]. the court will find the mother conceded at the directions hearing of 14 march 2023 that time had not occurred with [mr ranwick]. when asked directly by his honour judge neville as to the basis for time not occurring, the mother answered by saying: \u201cas i said before, your honour, [mr ranwick] has sent messages which indicate that he intends for [d] to commence at [town e]. her enrolment remains open at [town e] and i have concerns that he would again withhold [d] and place her in the school in [town e] given a message that i received on the talkingparents app on or around 25 january this year.\u201d the court will find the mother had no basis for believing as she alleges she did, and that such a justification could not possibly constitute a reasonable excuse in all of the circumstances. the court will find the time-based contraventions proved, and that the mother had no reasonable excuse for doing so. the school-based contravention in relation to what might be described as the \u201cschool-based contravention\u201d the court will make the following factual findings: the mother made an application for [d] to be enrolled in [aw school] at 4:34am on 24 january 2023, the mother sent a talkingparents message asking [mr ranwick] to nominate one of two schools for [d] to attend (one of which was [aw school]) at 1:59pm on 24 january 2023, on 25 january 2023, [mr ranwick] caused his solicitors to write to the mother consenting to enrolment in [bg school]. on 28 january 2023, the mother sent a talkingparents message saying \u201c[bg school] cannot enrol [d] as it isn\u2019t in her zone. she has been offered a place at [aw school]\u201d and \u201ci will forward you a copy of the forms by email. you\u2019re listed on the enrolment as the other parent, along with your contact name and number, and your address\u201d. the mother did not send the enrolment form to [mr ranwick], nor does the enrolment form list him as [d]\u2019s other parent. the court will find that the mother unilaterally applied for [d] to be enrolled in [aw school] without first consulting [mr ranwick]. the court will find that the messages by the mother to [mr ranwick] about this issue were purely performative, and disingenuous in circumstances where she had already taken active steps to enrol [d] in [aw school] without his knowledge. the court will find the school-based contravention proved, and that the mother had no reasonable excuse for doing so. it is submitted the court will find [mr ranwick] had no choice but to bring the current application for contravention to reinstate his time with [d], and the application constitutes yet another example in this long and protracted case of the mother demonstrating a high-handed disregard of the orders of this court, and a propensity toward ongoing conflict. if the contraventions are found proved without reasonable excuse, then pursuant to s 70nba(1) of the family law act 1975 (cth), [mr ranwick] contends the orders of 30 june 2020 ought to be varied such that [d] live with him, that he have sole parental responsibility for [d], and that [d] spend no time with the mother. change of orders the court is empowered to vary existing parenting orders within contravention proceedings, and that power is not subject to whether the contravention is ultimately proven, or whether a reasonable excuse is ultimately accepted. in these proceedings, the non-workability of the current orders is not in dispute between the parties. in or around december 2022, the mother relocated to [bc street], [suburb ak] [city ab]. on 20 december 2022, his honour judge neville ordered the mother to disclose a copy of her lease. a review of the lease, or \u201coccupancy agreement\u201d, reveals that it is an \u201coccupancy agreement for emergency accommodation for people in crisis\u201d and that the term of the occupancy agreement concludes on 8 june 2023. there is a lacuna in the mother\u2019s evidence before the court about what is likely to happen if she is unable to secure accommodation past 8 june 2023. the mother has spoken repeatedly, both in court and in her evidence, of the extreme difficulty she has previously encountered in securing accommodation in the [city ab]. there is no evidentiary basis to suggest she will not be subjected to the same adversity at the conclusion of her current occupancy agreement. the court will find that, given the mother is residing in crisis accommodation, there is real possibility she will once again be without residence in the [city ab], and [d] will return to the father\u2019s care in [town e], nsw. the father was previously [d]\u2019s resident parent and primary carer from september 2021 to january 2023. the father has a stable and loving relationship with his fianc\u00e9, [ms an]. in november 2021, the father and [ms an] had a son, [bd], [d]\u2019s half-brother. [d] was previously enrolled at [ae school] and was due to commence term 1 on 3 february 2023. [d] had previously completed the transition program and is familiar with the school, her peers, and her teacher [ms be]. [d]\u2019s enrolment remains open. it is submitted the father has demonstrated himself to be a competent and diligent parent, with stable accommodation, work, and relationship. conversely, it is submitted the mother has demonstrated herself as dishonest, capricious, prone to continuing conflict, and having unstable living arrangements. the mother also continues to exhibit a high-handed, recalcitrant attitude towards compliance with orders of this court. she has not exhibited acceptance of any wrongdoing, or contrition with respect to her conduct. the court would have very serious concerns that if it did not vary the orders in the manner proposed by the father, the mother will continue to contravene the orders into the future. it is the father\u2019s contention that the court, pursuant to s 70nba(1) of the family law act 1975 (cth) should vary the orders of her honour judge hughes dated 30 june 2020 such that: [d] live with the father, the father have sole parental responsibility for [d], and that the mother spend no time with [d]. penalty the father was forced to bring the application for contravention dated 7 march 2023 in circumstances where his time with [d] had ceased entirely from 20 january 2023, notwithstanding there being final orders for [d] to spend four (4) nights per fortnight with the father, numerous attempts by the father to ensure (at least partial) compliance with those orders, and his honour judge neville being reserved on two separate applications in this matter. it is contended by the father that the mother has exhibited a \u201cserious disregard of...her obligations under the primary order\u201d, and consequently, it is submitted the contravention ought to be dealt with under subdivision f, division 13a, part vii of the family law act 1975 (cth). the mother\u2019s serious disregard for her obligations is exemplified in the following concessions made during cross-examination at hearing on 24 march 2023: that despite being aware of the order for equal share parental responsibility, and understanding the obligations created by that order, she enrolled [d] in [aw school] before she invited the father to have input into same, and did not include the father on the enrolment form for [aw school], or the enrolment form to [bg school] [despite the latter not being in evidence]. that she received all letters from the father\u2019s legal representatives and all messages from the father about compliance with orders, but responded to none of them. that she made no effort whatsoever to comply with the orders in any way. that she notified child support she intended to contravene the orders before [d] was returned to her care. where a contravention is established as having occurred without reasonable excuse, and where the person having contravened the orders has demonstrated a serious disregard of his or her obligations under the primary order, the court must make an order requiring the person who committed the contravention(s) to pay all of the costs of another party to proceedings under the division, unless the court could be satisfied that the making of such an order is not in the best interests of the child. the father has been legally represented, without the assistance of a grant of legal aid, for the duration of these proceedings. he has incurred considerable legal fees as a consequence of the prolonged litigation, including in relation to the most recent application for contravention. there is no evidence currently before the court which would cause the court concern an order for costs on the indemnity basis against the mother is not in [d]\u2019s best interests. indeed, such an order may actually be in [d]\u2019s best interests if the court ultimately makes orders consistent with the father\u2019s submissions. the father contends the mother ought to be subject to imposition of the following penalties: a costs order on the indemnity basis, fixed in the sum of $15,000, and a bond, without surety, to be of good behaviour for a period of not-less-than twelve (12) months. consideration and disposition pleas and findings penalties ] section 117(1) of the act provides: \u201c[s]ubject to subsection (2), subsection 70nfb(1) and sections 117aa, 117ab, 117ac and 118, each party to proceedings under this act shall bear his or her own costs.\u201d [63] section 117(2) of the act provides that if, in proceedings under the act, the court is of opinion that there are circumstances that justify it in doing so, it may, subject to sub-ss (2a), (4) and (5), and the applicable rules, make such order as to costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, as it considers just. [64] section 117(2a) of the act provides that in considering what order (if any) should be made under s 117(2), the court shall have regard to the matters set out in paragraphs (a) to (g). in fitzgerald (as child representative for a (legal aid commission of tasmania) v fish and another [2005] famca 158, (2005) 33 fam lr 123 the full court (kay, warnick and boland jj), referring to s 117(2a), said at 130 [41] : a number of factors are then listed in the subparagraphs. the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings is the first mentioned factor. nowhere in subs (2a) or elsewhere in s 117, is there any prescription that more than one factor must be present before an order for costs is made nor of comparative weight of the factors set out in subs (2a). as a consequence, there is nothing to prevent any factor being the sole foundation for an order for costs. ] as to the relationship between s 117(1) and s 117(2) of the act in penfold v penfold [1980] hca 4, (1980) 144 clr 311, in joint reasons, stephen, mason, aickin and wilson jj said at 315: it is an accurate description of s. 117 (1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the sub-section is not paramount to s. 117 (2). as sub-s. (1) is expressed to be subject to sub-s. (2) the former must yield whenever a judge finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. sub-section (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs. consequently, with respect to their honours in the family court, we do not agree with the suggestion made in the judgment under appeal that an order can only be made under s. 117 (2) in \u201ca clear case\u201d. (emphasis added) ] as to the nature of the hearing of an application pursuant to s 117 of the act in penfold their honours said at 315-16: sub-section (2) does not in our view as a matter of law require the judge to specify the circumstances which justify the making of an order. it does not expressly say so, and in the context of the making of an order for costs there is no sufficient basis for making an implication. judges very frequently make orders for costs without giving reasons or making findings, even when costs are in issue. the absence of reasons or findings does not in itself indicate that a judge has erroneously exercised his discretion to award costs, though it will place an appellate court in the position of examining the circumstances and of determining for itself whether the circumstances show that the discretion was erroneously exercised (kent v. kent [(1970) 92 w.n. (nsw) 503, at p. 505]). accordingly, in the absence of some positive legislative indication we should not attribute to parliament the requirement that a judge must make particular findings in relation to an order for costs. ] we also observe that in re jjt, ex parte victoria legal aid (1998) 195 clr 184 the majority of the high court (gaudron, gummow, hayne and callinan jj, kirby j dissenting) held that s 117(2) of the act referred to costs in the conventional sense and thus to the payment by one party to litigation of money by way of a partial indemnity for professional legal fees and expenses actually incurred by another party in the course of the litigation: see hayne j at 219. an order for costs is made to compensate a party against expense incurred in litigation and is not punitive in nature. costs are not a penalty or damages: latoudis v casey [1990] hca 59, (1990) 170 clr 534 per mason cj at 543 and mchugh j at 567, ruddock and ors v vadarlis and ors (2001) 188 alr 143 per full court of the federal court at [12] and brott and joachim [2006] famca 256, (2006) flc 93-259 per full court (holden, warnick and boland jj) at 80,403-404. an order for costs may be made on an indemnity basis, subject to a judicial determination capable of being made that there ought to be a departure from the usual basis that costs be payable on the party and party basis. for a discussion of the jurisdiction to order indemnity costs and its exercise see colgate palmolive co and another v cussons pty ltd [1993] fca 536, (1993) 118 alr 248 per sheppard j at 256-257 and nmfm property pty ltd and others v citibank ltd (no 2) (court\u2019s \u201cnmfm\u201d judgment no 11) [2011] fca 480, (2001) 109 fcr 77 per lindgren j at [53] to [90]. it seems to me that the following principles or guidelines can be distilled out of the authorities to which i have referred:- 1. the problem arises in adversary litigation, i.e. litigation as between parties at arm's length. different considerations apply where parties may be found to be entitled to the payment of their costs out of a fund or assets being administered by or under the control of a trustee, liquidator, receiver or person in a like position, eg. a government agency or statutory authority. 2. the ordinary rule is that, where the court orders the costs of one party to litigation to be paid by another party, the order is for payment of those costs on the party and party basis. in this court the provisions of order 62, rules 12 and 19, and the second schedule to the rules will apply to the taxation. in many cases the result will be that the amount recovered by the successful party under the order will fall short of (in many cases well short of) a complete indemnity. 3. this has been the settled practice for centuries in england. it is a practice which is entrenched in australia. either legislation (perhaps in the form of an amendment to rules of court) or a decision of an intermediate court of appeal or of the high court would be required to alter it. no doubt any consideration of whether there should be any change in the practice would require the resolution of the competing considerations mentioned by devlin lj in berry v. british transport commission and handley ja in cachia v. hanes on the one hand and by rogers j in qantas on the other. the relevant passages from the respective judgments have been earlier referred to. 4. in consequence of the settled practice which exists, the court ought not usually make an order for the payment of costs on some basis other than the party and party basis. the circumstances of the case must be such as to warrant the court in departing from the usual course. that has been the view of all judges dealing with applications for payment of costs on the indemnity or some other basis whether here or in england. the tests have been variously put. the court of appeal in andrews v. barnes (39 ch d at 141) said the court had a general and discretionary power to award costs as between solicitor and client \"as and when the justice of the case might so require.\" woodward j in fountain selected meats appears to have adopted what was said by brandon lj (as he was) in preston v. preston ((1982) 1 all er at 58) namely, there should be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court in departing from the ordinary practice. most judges dealing with the problem have resolved the particular case before them by dealing with the circumstances of that case and finding in it the presence or absence of factors which would be capable, if they existed, of warranting a departure from the usual rule. but as french j said (at 8) in tetijo, \"the categories in which the discretion may be exercised are not closed\". davies j expressed (at 6) similar views in ragata. 5. notwithstanding the fact that that is so, it is useful to note some of the circumstances which have been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion. i instance the making of allegations of fraud knowing them to be false and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud (both referred to by woodward j in fountain and also by gummow j in thors v. weekes (1989) 92 alr 131 at 152, evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the court and to other parties (french j in tetijo), the fact that the proceedings were commenced or continued for some ulterior motive (davies j in ragata) or in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (woodward j in fountain and french j in j-corp), the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (davies j in ragata), an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg messiter v. hutchinson (1987) 10 nswlr 525, maitland hospital v. fisher (no. 2) (1992) 27 nswlr 721at 724 (court of appeal), crisp v. keng (supreme court of new south wales, 27 september 1993, unreported, court of appeal)and an award of costs on an indemnity basis against a contemnor (eg megarry v-c in emi records). other categories of cases are to be found in the reports. yet others to arise in the future will have different features about them which may justify an order for costs on the indemnity basis. the question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for payment of costs other than on a party and party basis. 6. it remains to say that the existence of particular facts and circumstances capable of warranting the making of an order for payment of costs, for instance, on the indemnity basis, does not mean that judges are necessarily obliged to exercise their discretion to make such an order. the costs are always in the discretion of the trial judge. provided that discretion is exercised having regard to the applicable principles and the particular circumstances of the instant case its exercise will not be found to have miscarried unless it appears that the order which has been made involves a manifest error or injustice. s.70nba & variation of final orders for the purposes of s.60cc(3)(b) and (d), d has two siblings: bd who obviously (as a quite young child of perhaps 18 months of age) lives exclusively with the father and his partner, and her older sister, b, who now lives in a week-about arrangement between the mother and mr solberg. thus, for example, in living with the father, d would be with bd all of the time except for the limited time she is with the mother, whereas if d lived primarily with the mother, she would only spend time with b when there was a coincidence and overlap between the two sisters with their mother, (ii) the father and his partner live in permanent

consistently protested her plan to return to the city ab region and to secure permanent accommodation. regrettably for all concerned but most especially both of her daughters, the mother lived in a

[emphasis added] applicable law standard of proof in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged. credit of parties ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... [citations omitted] ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (\u201ccarlson\u201d) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case: 5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... 9] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide. ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to. family law act provisions 60b objects of part and principles underlying it the objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by: (a) ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.

[ellipses in original] interesting that you verbalised yr concern about [y\u2019s] speech tonight at parent teacher, but yet see no need to take her to the speech pathologist yourself. not sure who you are kidding in this scenario it's about time you considered financial and time contributions to their medical costs. the father responded the following day as follows: i pay for their private health insurance. the mother responded: stop kidding yourself. you will take him and pay for it. btw not very nice for a son to be dumped on a doorstep at changeover by his father. he was not \"dumped\" i walked him to the door and kissed him good bye. i was just avoiding another earful from you really? the car was on when i opened the door. what a load of bullshit- i never give you an earful. i don't bother speaking to you because you struggle to comprehend basic conversation and are unable to communicate. they don't need to hear the crap that comes out of your mouth. i don't have any international legally enforceable assurance that, should circumstances change and you decide to keep the children out of australia, i could make sure they live in melb. i'm happy for them to have [country e] passports when they are older just not at the moment. would want to know that [grandfather] [the mother's father] is still here. if you wanted to see him while [y] is at [[music lessons]] around the corner he can. he [the mother's father] is sleeping peacefully he was wanting to see him tomorrow but i suspect they today would be better. the father responded: he will stay at home while she's at [music lessons]. he hasn't asked so i won't remind him. he might not ask you but it might be on his mind so please tell him. what do you want to speak to [x] about? u only dropped him off at school this morning [the monday] he was sad on the weekend so i just wanted to reassure him. reassure him that you are the asshole that wouldn't let him see his grandfather before he died. don't worry [the mother's father] knew it till the end, even in his demented state exactly what you stood for i was disappointed you never informed me that they both missed school last friday the teachers were informed prior to this, and it was logged online to which you have access to. that system is not designed to notify parents of school absence i am not required to inform you refusing to contribute to taking them and paying for medical appointments is not fulfilling your parental duties. you need to work on your communication alongside your parental contributions or rather lack of. they are getting older and can see you for who you are with their own eyes. and also the following (from the mother) on the same day: you have never shown that you have maintained their health insurance as orders have indicated you must. i do not believe that you have and will never trust that you will. the fact that you think your contributions stop at health insurance is very sad and very inaccurate. that you keep referencing your lawyer and not the actual signed agreement that does not say i need to pay for everything is also concerning and negligent at best. you have millions of dollars and you do not pay for any child rearing costs so never use that excuse. i also need to work to pay for their needs. something you don't contribute to. i regularly have to take time off to take them to these necessary appointments. it is actual not an option. this has happened for many years. both taking and paying for them is what a parent does. do you understand that? perhaps you should never have had children. not clawing anything. the agreement signed was one where you are supposed to take care of the children and associated costs whilst they are in your care. again it is not specified anywhere that i should pay for the extracurricular, schooling, uniform, medical so i will continue to ask for your contribution which you can choose to decline at the knowledge that one day your children will realise how inappropriate and selfish your behaviour is, and how inappropriate it is for a father to pay for nothing. there was no agreement signed in 2016 because you wanted money for child support/maintenance and we all know how that would/did turn out. i pay for the children and then i have to pay you. shameful at best. your lack of responsibility as a parent to provide prescribed medical treatment for your son is clear. this is neglect. your refusal to contribute to your share of their health costs is shameful. the fear in your children about returning to school when they are in your care without uniform should make you ashamed. unfortunately i don't think you can see the damage you have and continue to do. it's disgusting. i\u2019ll only take her. please advise why you have [not] notified me that [x] has not had his plate in for 5 days? do you want him to have the surgery you had? because unless he wears it that is exactly where he is heading. you have been advised on multiple occasions that he needs to wear it. the father responded as follows: please advise why it has taken you 5 days to admit that you forgot to check whether he had remembered his plate. you're the [health care professional] so i don't question your decisions here. yes i admit it took me 5 days to go and clean the boys' bathroom, that we don't use, to find it next to the basin. your behaviour is nothing short of irresponsible and negligent. blame yourself when he goes under the knife. your genes and your neglect. he has been in your care for 5 days and you did not notice he wasn't wearing it. i have not seen him for 5 days, nor do i accept responsibility for what he packs. you should be ashamed of yourself that you continue to put your children in this position. buy some uniforms. this is your responsibility not theirs. she doesn't want to do swimming but is worried you\u2019ll get angry and the mother replied: whatever...good story, mate. [ellipses in original] ... is [j's] bday and we have the boys that evening. given corona and social distancing it would be good for all the kids if they could spend a few hours together celebrating this. would you be able to swap an evening to facilitate this? on the following three conditions. 1. you always make available any of the kids uniforms 2. you never ask for more costs on anything 3. your reply is a simple one-word yes to agree otherwise i\u2019ll deem it a no to these conditions, and they\u2019ll stay with me the question you should be asking is whether your children would enjoy a few hours with their step brother on his birthday, given they have had no parties, no play dates, no school and no visits from extended families for... i would like to have the kids wed june 23 so that we can get a direct flight to go away. can you exchange this school night for another? there are not many seats left so i would appreciate if you could get back to me the father's response was as follows: and i would like 50:50 shared care i am asking to exchange a night so we can go on a family holiday, and not have to take 2 flights with 5 kids. are you saying no? i am saying that if you agree to 50:50 shared care henceforth i will agree i do not believe that 50:50 is in the children's best interests. your response is out of line and at the expense of what is a reasonable request. expert evidence ... [the mother] organises, attends and pays for all the children's medical appointments. [the father] will make comments such as\"/ will only take them if you pay for it\". the only expense he has to pay as it is court ordered is the prescription medications. he is frustrated that he has to make his own appointment to get these scripts and feels she should provide the scripts she receives in her appointments to him. ... [the mother] will update [the father] after medical appointments, however she will get no acknowledgement for these messages. ... there is constant conflict regarding the school uniforms for both children. [the father] refuses to purchase a set of uniforms that can be stored at his house. the children are getting so stressed about this that [x] sent his father an email saying that he did not like it as carrying an extra bag on changeover days was hurting his back. ... [x] has also used his own pocket money to purchase uniform items for sports to keep at his father's house as his father wouldn't do this. ... [the mother] reported that there is also conflict regarding \"the children\" and their phones, [the father] will confiscate [x\u2019s] phone as soon as he arrives at his house, and if \"the children\" are to text her there is no privacy. [the father] reads the messages she sends to \"the children\" and requires all the phone calls to be on speaker phone so he can listen. [x] is getting very frustrated at this as his social world involves messaging friends on the weekend which he is not allowed to do at his father's house. ... in regard to [the father\u2019s] mental health, although there were no obvious issues during the interview process, the report writer did notice [the father\u2019s] inability to understand the consequences of some of his actions, such as not responding to messages from [the mother], how charging uniforms to another person's account was not acceptable or the impact of not having uniforms at his house was having on \"the children\". if this matter does continue, a psychiatric assessment may be beneficial to rule out any underlying conditions for [the father]. ... [the father] feels that it is time for this extra time to be granted as it is better for the children to have both parents \"equal\" in their lives. ... [the father] agreed that [the mother] communicated about appointments and things like changes in medication for \"the children\", the report writer asked if the acknowledged these messages, to which he said \"no\". ... [the father] was very frustrated that [the mother] had not communicated with him about issues occurring in the household between her husband and his son. there were false allegations that he had been violent to his son, he had to seek the information from [mr f's] ex-partner. [the father] made comments that he needed the extra time to occur as he had safety concerns for \"the children\". the conversation got very confusing, [the father] agreed that the allegations against [mr f] were false, but then commented that because of the allegations and an undertaking now in place, his children were at risk of domestic violence. ... [the father] did display a lot of love for his children during the interview process and often got teary when speaking about them. ... [x] is 12 years old and in year 7 at [l school]. he spoke very confidently in his interview and the report writer believed his words to be his own and not influenced by another person. ... there are many issues occurring in the co-parenting of [x] and [y] and the report writer was very concerned at the impact this is having on them. maybe when they were younger, they were not concerned with things such as privacy and packing bags, but as they get older, they have concerns and their concerns are not being listened to. the communication between [the mother] and [the father] appears to be non-existent. [the father] is accusing [the mother] of being abusive in her messages however no evidence was presented in his affidavit material to verify this so the report writer can not confirm or deny these behaviours. either way, [the father] did agree that he will not acknowledge messages sent to him, yet he had complaints about some information such as absent school days not being provided to him. ... it is very obvious that [the mother] has had to take control of the medical needs of \"the children\", making the appointments, attending the appointments and paying for the appointments. [the father] had an understanding of the children's needs which has to of come from information being provided by [the mother]. the report writer is unsure as to why [the father] has made the decision to not meet or speak to some of the professionals who have been involved with \"the children\" for many years such as the psychologist, as information provided by specialists is important for both parents to understand. ... the report writer encourages [the father] to listen to \"the children\" in regard to their comments about the school holiday care when he is working and also in regard to allowing some more responsibility for his almost teenage son. the report writer understands why [the mother] is seeking sole parental responsibility for medical and schooling of \"the children\", if there cannot be any improvement in the communication between the parents, the report writer would not be opposed to this recommendation. ... the report writer felt that [x] and [y] were witnessing the conflict between the parents and recommended this cease immediately for their mental health and happiness. ... recommendations it is recommended that [x] and [y] live with their mother and spend time with their father five nights a fortnight in line with the current court ordered schedule. it is recommended that [x] and [y] spend half the school holidays with each parent and that even if their school holiday periods don't align they are not separated from each other. it is recommended that both parents have uniforms at each property for [x] and [y] to reduce the stress that has been occurring as a result of this. it is recommended that [x] and [y] contact the parent they are not with when they want to and that they are given privacy with this communication. it is recommended that conflict between the parents in front of [x] and [y] cease immediately. it is recommended that if [the father] does not improve his communication in the way of responding to [the mother] about medical and schooling information that a sole parental responsibility order be considered for [the mother]. [emphasis added] the school uniform standoff ... it is recommended that both parents have uniforms at each property for [x] and [y] to reduce the stress that has been occurring as a result of this. the water connection issue 2.4 the father forthwith and within 48 hours of the date of these orders do all acts and things to ensure that he has running water (and all other household utilities and necessities including but not limited to adequate heating) in his home and he provide evidence of same to the mother and the children's overnight time with the father be suspended pending his compliance with this order. the injunction restricting time with the father's mother 2.5.4 that during the long summer school holidays, the children are not to be left in the care of the paternal grandmother without the prior consent in writing of the mother and should the father be unavailable to care for the children he is to give the mother the first option to do so. the travel and passport issue section 60cc matters primary considerations additional considerations any views expressed by the children ...

affidavits filed 20 november 2018, 7 june 2019, and 15 february 2021. in addition, he relied on a financial statement filed 16 august 2021, which he was permitted to rely on in circumstances that i shall come to shortly. 17 the wife sought orders in accordance with her response filed 25 may 2019, that the husband\u2019s application be dismissed. she relied on affidavits filed 25 march 2019, 30 october 2019, and financial statement filed 25 march 2019. she updated the valuations of the two properties in her evidence-in-chief. 18 both parties provided balance sheets at exhibit w1 and h1. the husband\u2019s financial statement is blank, other than at paragraphs 35 and 36. those refer to the properties at b street, suburb c and d street, suburb e, and assert a 50 per cent registered ownership. no value is attributed to either property, and the document is otherwise blank. there was no prejudice to the wife in the husband being permitted to rely on the document. 19 the financial statement exemplifies the difficulties in dealing with this matter. the husband has failed to comply with even the most basic requirement for disclosure. he is prepared to make broad assertions that the wife is a liar, without any evidence in support. 20 the balance sheet tendered by the husband lists assets of a used car at $11,000, shares at $1,200 and savings of $1,000 as assets, and liabilities of an \u201ceducation loan\u201d of $15,700. i have no information about the acquisition of any of the assets or loan. the document is otherwise blank. 21 i accept that the wife has attempted to put before the court relevant material, and to address relevant issues. despite directions made, the husband did not deal with the matters on the balance sheet provided to him by the wife. instead, he set out his current financial position, as he described it. that is marked as exhibit h1. as i explained to him on a number of occasions, a balance sheet is not evidence, and provides no information about the supporting facts. i invited him to put relevant evidence before me. no evidence was forthcoming of his current financial situation. 22 neither party was able to effectively cross-examine the other, as is often the case when people are self-represented. in order to ascertain disputed facts, i look to documentary evidence provided and whether it supports the party\u2019s version of events. 23 the hearing was conducted during the pandemic, and the parties appeared through microsoft teams. court staff assisted the father with use of the system on his device, so that he could both hear and see to participate in the proceedings. 24 the obligation on parties is to provide full and frank disclosure and where there is clear evidence of non-disclosure, the court should not be unduly cautious in making findings in favour of the innocent party.[1] i am satisfied that the husband has failed to make full and frank financial disclosure. amongst other things, this is particularly pertinent to the property in country f, and his engagement in share trading. 25 the wife has referred to a potential inheritance of the husband of a share in a property in country f. there is no evidence about the inheritance property, and i do not propose including it as a financial resource of the husband. i otherwise accept the balance sheet set out by the wife. i note that it is supported by her evidence contained in her affidavits, and supporting documents. 26 balance sheet: the date of separation, and whether the parties resided separately under the one roof 27 the wife has asserted in these proceedings that the parties separated in 2011. the application for divorce is annexed to the wife\u2019s affidavit of 30 october 2019. the wife asserted a date of separation of 27 november 2013 in the divorce application. 28 the mortgage applications made by the wife, for example on 15 december 2012[2] are consistent with her assertions in these proceedings with respect to separation. she solely applied for the mortgage. the loan application refers to her marital status as separated. the application refers only to her employment and income. 29 she made a further mortgage application to anz on 21 august 2015 to purchase the investment property. again, she was the sole applicant. the application lists her marital status as separated. both mortgage applications pre-date the husband\u2019s date of separation in 2016. 30 the wife says that the date of separation in her application for divorce is different to her current assertion because separation and divorce in her culture is a taboo. she did not tell friends or extended family until november 2013 that she was separated. she said that she did this in response to questioning about where her husband was, and why they were not out together or entertaining at home together. 31 the loan applications are compelling evidence that she was separated at the time of making applications in 2012 and 2015. there was no challenge to the wife over the difference between the date asserted by her in these proceedings, and on the divorce application. the husband maintained separation did not occur until he left the home in 2016. i accept the evidence of the wife that the parties separated in 2011. this view is bolstered by the wife\u2019s efforts in court to deal with matters in a direct and straightforward manner. whether the property in country f was transferred by the husband to the wife. 32 the husband asserts that whilst he was visiting country f he was served with an application for an country f divorce by a lawyer on the wife\u2019s behalf. he suggests that as part of those proceedings the country f property was transferred into the wife\u2019s name. elsewhere in his affidavit evidence he says the wife \u201cseized my property in country f\u201d, and that the wife\u2019s mother will be selling the property on the wife\u2019s behalf. he provides nothing in support of this contention, and it is denied by the wife. 33 the wife\u2019s evidence is that the property was purchased by the husband, and remains in his name. the husband had an income from leasing part of the property when the parties resided in country f. he otherwise conducted a business from the property. the wife is unaware of what has occurred with respect to the rental income, as he has not provided any documentation relating to that. i accept the wife\u2019s contentions in that regard. whether the husband made contributions to the purchases of property in australia 34 the husband gives no evidence of any direct financial contribution by him to the acquisition of the two properties, nor to the mortgages. he asserts that he and the wife\u2019s brother opened a joint bank account into which \u201call rents and money were deposited\u201d and sent to australia[3]. there is no evidence from him of what became of those funds, nor the amount. 35 the parties have one child who is now an adult. she is studying, and financially assisted by her mother with whom she lives. there is no evidence of financial support provided by the husband. 36 the husband asserts that he paid \u201call my income to her rather than the tax office to keep her calm and happy\u201d, and suggests that he has a debt to the australian taxation office. there are no specifics of any debt provided. he says that he paid household expenses, including dental and other expenses for the parties\u2019 child, prior to 2016. that is disputed by the wife. he refers to working as a taxi driver after arriving in australia. he was a qualified health care professional in country f. 37 the husband provides no current evidence of his income from any source, before or after separation. he says he is currently living in shared accommodation. he does not explain how he pays rent for that accommodation. he has previously referred to receiving newstart allowance. 38 the wife tendered bank j statements[4] for an account in the husband\u2019s name for the period 30 june 2018 to 31 december 2018. the statements demonstrate share trading over that period. the total debits on the account are $103,799, and the total credits, $103,786. 39 the husband gives no evidence about share trading. one financial statement refers to shares to the value of $500. he did not provide his bank statements by way of disclosure. he was directed to provide details of his accounts by way of orders made 12 july 2019. he did not do so. as a result of his non-disclosure it is impossible to assess his current income, or more generally his financial situation. 40 the wife purchased a residential property in b street, suburb c in 2012, and an investment property in d street, suburb e in 2015. the purchases of the properties were funded by mortgages from anz bank of $628,008 and $636,171.46 respectively. the wife has met weekly mortgage repayments, which are directly debited from her bank account. the mortgages are currently standing at $741,000 on the b street, suburb c property, and $640,000 on the d street, suburb e property following her re-financing the properties in 2017. 41 the wife has provided detailed evidence of her obtaining mortgages to purchase the two properties, and meeting repayments. her own evidence is supported by documents she relies on from anz bank. she has been employed since arriving in australia. she utilised her income to meet the mortgage payments, and supported herself and the parties\u2019 daughter. i accept her evidence. it supports the proposition that following separation she purchased the properties utilising her financial resources, and has maintained the properties since. 42 the husband had the benefit of residing at b street, suburb c for 4 years post separation. there is no evidence he made any contributions to the benefit of the household over that period. the husband asserts that he arrived from country f with savings of some $40,000. he provides no evidence in support of this, nor of how those funds were expended. 43 the husband has travelled to country f on at least one occasion for his father\u2019s funeral. there is no evidence of how he paid for that, nor how long he was there. 44 the husband has provided no evidence of any direct, or significant indirect, contributions to the properties in b street, suburb c and d street, suburb e. i find that the wife has solely contributed to the acquisition and maintenance of the two properties in sydney. 45 the wife is the sole proprietor of the two properties, and is solely responsible for mortgage payments. she has met all costs for the properties since purchase. she has retained all income from the investment property since purchase. the purchases took place after separation, when the parties were living separated under the one roof. 46 the court is required to consider whether it would be just and equitable to make an order altering her interest in those properties[5]. in the circumstances of the wife having met all costs associated with the acquisition and maintenance of those properties post separation, i do not find that it would be just or equitable to alter her legal title to the properties. 47 the parties do not own any property jointly. the husband has a commercial property in his sole name in country f. the wife estimated the value of that property at $400,000. no valuation was provided. it is a commercial building that the husband operated a business from, with space leased to other commercial enterprises. i have no evidence about the purchase of that property, where funds came from, whether there was a loan, nor how any loan was paid. it is an agreed fact that part of the property was leased prior to their move to australia. there is no evidence of use of rental income before the move to australia, nor after. i accept that property remains in the husband\u2019s sole name. that property shall remain the property of the husband. 48 in terms of percentage division the husband retains the whole of the only asset that existed prior to separation. the wife retains the properties acquired by her post separation. she commenced employment around the time of separation. she did not commence accumulating superannuation until around the time of separation. i am not satisfied that it would be just and equitable to make any order affecting the wife\u2019s superannuation entitlement. future needs 49 the wife is in reasonable health. she is aged 45 years. she works as a manager, and earns $4,383 per week. she has superannuation of $190,000. 50 the wife has been responsible for the financial support of the parties\u2019 daughter, who is now an adult. she is engaged in tertiary education, and lives with the wife. 51 the husband is 59 years old. i do not know anything of his current financial situation. he has provided no evidence about income he derived, or still derives, from share trading. he has provided no evidence of use of rental income from the country f property, nor anything else to do with that property. i accept that property is retained by him, and has previously provided an income. 52 i have little evidence of the husband\u2019s state of health. he asserts that he has pain in his hips. he annexed to an affidavit a report from k imaging to dr l at m hospital rheumatology department. i assume it is a report of a radiologist. the report refers to mild degenerative fraying of the anterosuperior labrum. it refers to \u201cno cartilage wear elsewhere\u201d. the report then refers to \u201cthere appears to be a small fat containing right indirect inguinal hernia\u201d, no other issues are observed. i have no evidence of what that may mean for him in terms of diagnosis, or prognosis. there is no evidence on how those matters may impact on his capacity to work. 53 the husband claims he has depression and memory issues as a consequence of the stress the wife has put him under. there is no medical evidence placed before me in support of those contentions. 54 the husband\u2019s lack of evidence has made it impossible to properly assess his future needs. i do not know what, if any, resources he may have at his disposal. i accept that he has a property in country f, which was sufficient to provide him premises to run a business from, and to provide an income stream from leasing part of the building. 55 in the circumstances of this matter i do not regard the evidence as supporting an adjustment to the husband on the basis of his future needs. 56 the husband\u2019s application is dismissed and i order the removal of the caveats on the b street, suburb c and d street, suburb e properties. associate: dated: 29 october 2021 [1] black & kellner [1992]

[ms dieu] paid registration, green slip and insurance for the [motor vehicle 3]. items 18 and 19: jewellery item 20: coins and old bank notes collection ..regarding your coins collection, our client vehemently denies your vexatious claim against her. she did not take your collection of bank notes and coins. our client left the property without preplanning due to the family physical violence against her and she has not return [sic] since the incident. however, your sister advised our client that the property [d street, suburb c] was burgled. this could explain the disappearance of your prize notes and coins collection. our client does not have your coin collection. you have misplaced it and cannot blame our client for losing it. she does not know where the collection is and has no reason to lie about your coin collection. add backs we observe that \u201cnotional property\u201d, which is sometimes \u201cadded back\u201d to a list of assets to account for the unilateral disposal of assets, is unlikely to constitute \u201cproperty of the parties to the marriage or either of them\u201d, and thus is not amenable to alteration under s79. it is important to deal with such disposals carefully, recognising the assets no longer exist, but that the disposal of them forms part of the history of the marriage \u2013 and potentially an important part. as the question does not arise here, we need say nothing more on this topic, save to note that s 79(4) and in particular s75(2)(o) gives ample scope to ensure a just and equitable outcome when dealing with the unilateral disposal of property. ...when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not \u201cexceptional\u201d justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion \u2014 usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is \u201ca course which is, perhaps, technically more correct\u201d than adding back to the list of existing interests in property. (footnotes omitted) items 23 - 30: addbacks asserted by the husband in relation to the j street, suburb c property dieu] had skimmed $100 off the top of our joint weekly rental income from the [j street, suburb c] property and the money was deposited into his personal cba account and i\u2019m not sure for how long this type of activity has been going on for if at all prior to separation. items 31-33 and 35-36: addbacks asserted by the husband in relation to the b street, suburb c property items 34 and 37 \u2013 maintenance and renovation to the b street, suburb c property and loss of rent for the b street, suburb c property unfortunately, i never saw nor heard nor i can get in touch with [mr w] in october 2019. i paid [mr w] up to $50,000 before he disappeared. based on the building inspection report, in my opinion the resident [sic] is not habitable due to: unsafe electrical wiring, unsafe plumbing, leaking roof, damaged windows, presence of mould within the property, healing paint, suspected o [sic] be lead paint, presence of broken and loose asbestos, and general dilapidated nature of the property. in my opinion, no funds have been spent in the last 10 years for the general maintenance and upkeep of the property. warning supply to this service has been discontinued for safety reasons do not attempt to reconnect supply. supply can only be reconnected by an authorised agent of [company x]. removal of this seal will result in legal action taken. items 38 to 40 \u2013 addbacks asserted by the husband in relation to the d street, suburb c property her honour: there were some orders made in 2021 by consent that you have sole occupation of [d street, suburb c] and you be responsible for all the rates and outgoings for that property, so why would i now make the wife responsible for that? husband: 8 june 2021... so if you look - i have only included from 2017 to 2021. her honour: so why are you saying i should make an order that the wife be responsible for half of those outgoings? husband: from 2017 to 2021 i propose to go 50/50 with her. her honour: i understand that, but you need to tell me why i would do that? husband: well because that is not usage \u2013 it\u2019s fixed whether you live there or not you still have to pay for it. if it\u2019s water usage or something that i use, then yes, i\u2019m willing to pay for that. but this is an annual or quarterly or thing that whether you live there or not you still have to pay for it. item 41 \u2013 maintenance from september 2017 - july 2022 liabilities item 45: anz one offset account #...32 items 46-47: capital gains tax liability items 48 - 58: legal fees and disbursements paid by the husband item 59: child support paid by the husband from january 2018 to december 2022. value found bank o account #...25 anz account #...98 nil $518 $1,069 bank g everyday account #...88 $400,000 $350,000 $5,000 $4,000 $1,000 total $3,888,153 $116,800 value $252,563 $447,799 nk g] mortgage account #...68 $1,145 $451,145 total propery pool (including superannuation) $4,001,607 whether an order altering property interests should be made the assessment of contributions put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party\u2019s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties\u2019 respective contributions within s 79. ] ...established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties\u2019 respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the post separation period to the point of assessment... therefore, it is an item under my name solely own without entering the item into the marriage. it remains separate from the relationship and that i retain 100% ownership of the property without any complications. relevant s 79(4)(d) \u2013 (g) matters orders to be made just and equitable description value the d street, suburb c property bank o account ending #...25 anz account ending #...98 52.5% of proceeds of sale of j street, suburb c property $36,090 payment from husband $240,966 superannuation total assets $2,101,416 anz one offset account $573 total liabilities total net assets $2,100,843 the b street, suburb c property bank g everyday #...88 bank g everyday #...68 47.5% of proceeds of sale of j street, suburb c property $32,652 total assets: $2,592,302 $572 payment to wife $691,538 $1,900,764 associate: dated: 17 may 2023 dated: 17 may 2023 [1] hickey v hickey & attorney-general of the commonwealth (intervener) (2003) flc 93-143; [2003] famca 395 at [39].[2] wife affidavit, paragraph 69.

in our opinion it is not so much a matter of erosion of contribution but a question of what weight is to be attached, in all the circumstances, to the initial contribution. it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. in the present case that use was a substantial contribution to the purchase price of the matrimonial home: see also campo and campo (unreported, full court (ellis, lindenmayer and finn jj), sydney, delivered 19 may 1995 at pages 21 and 22 of the joint judgment) and zahra and zahra (unreported, full court sydney, delivered 3 october 1996, per ellis j. at page 10). we think that there is force in the proposition that a reference to the value of an item as at the date of the commencement of cohabitation without reference to its value to the parties at the time it was realised or its value to the parties at the time of trial, if still intact, may not give adequate recognition to the importance of its contribution to the pool of assets ultimately available for distribution towards the parties. thus where the pool of assets available for distribution between the parties consists of say an investment portfolio or a block of land or a painting that has risen significantly in value as a result of market forces, it is appropriate to give recognition to its value at the time of hearing or the time it was realised rather than simply pay attention to its initial value at the time of commencement of cohabitation. but in so doing it is equally as important to give recognition to the myriad of other contributions that each of the parties has made during the course of their relationship. in 1999, as security for the loan to acquire suburb j, (b) upon its sale in 2010, to discharge the suburb m

concerns are for emotional abuse and risk of sexual abuse by the father, due to ongoing inappropriate behaviours bordering on grooming. the girls are of an age where they are coming into puberty (8 and 12) and have expressed concerns about their father\u2019s behaviour. the father reportedly walks around naked, watches them shower, doesn\u2019t allow them to close the door when showering, hugs them whilst he is naked despite them asking him to stop, comes into the female bathroom with them at the pool as he identifies as non- binary, despite the girls not wanting him to come in with them, comes into the girls bedroom a few times a week in the middle of the night standing over them and breathes heavily. whilst there is no overt allegation of sexual abuse, the father\u2019s behaviour appears to be having a significant impact on the girl\u2019s wellbeing and could be a risk factor for sexual abuse and grooming in future. there are concerns for an element of control and secrecy around the father threatening to take the girls money away if they try to shut the bathroom door, and that they are not allowed to tell their mother. the girls have reportedly seen their father pin his new partner up against the wall, grabbing and yelling at her on occasions. there have been no prior interventions. there is a history of concern in relation to the father\u2019s behaviours: coercive control against the mother, multiple incidences of sexual abuse of the mother, grabbing and pinning [x] up against a wall. i agree with the recommendation for a 7 day appraisal due to the cumulation of concerns impacting on the girls, and the father\u2019s alleged history of sexual violence and control. under \u2018cyps history\u2019 this is the 8th report received in regards to the children, with the two previous reports regarding family violence occurring between the parents, the first being in 2018 previous themes of concerns reported in [early] 2022 \u2013 the mother\u2019s partner came and then left, when the mother went upstairs and father demanded sex while in the room with the girls and started to try and rape the mother. under \u2018findings and recommendations:\u2019 assessor has formed reasonable suspicion that the children may be at risk of emotional abuse and sexual abuse, and whilst mother is acting protectively at present, assessor is of the view that should they return to father's they may be in need of care and protection. findings in mid 2021 [x] began dressing in masculine clothing. she cut her hair quite short, and she was speaking with me openly about how she didn't like \u2018girly things and girls\u2019. [x] has been open about these discussions with me. after a number of months of [x] expressing herself in this way, i told her: \u201ci want you to understand puberty and the options available if you want to speak with someone other than your mother and i about what you are feeling, you can request that\u201d. [x] said to me: \u201ci don\u2019t know yet if i want to be a girl or boy in the long run\u201d in response to this, i told her \u201cpuberty is not reversible\u201d. i do recall that i mentioned that people going through similar things have elected to take puberty blockers. [x] said to me after this conversation \u201ci think i am ok just being a girl\u201d. i responded and said: \u201cthat\u2019s absolutely fine. if you ever want to talk about it please bring it up and we can talk about it all together\u201d. another conversation occurred sometime later, [x] and i had a neutral discussion in relation to transgender persons. we spoke about surgery options that some transgender people have for gender affirmation. in 2021, [x] also advised me: \u201ci\u2019m not interested in [g] (her previous flame) anymore, i really like this girl named [h].\u201d [x] has been open with me and content to have these communications with me. i understand [ms sarina] is resistant to my involvement. at no time did i encourage or suggest that [x] needed to be a boy, nor that she was \u2018transgender,\u2019 as alleged by [ms sarina] in her affidavit. the matters in section 60cc of the act there is a distinct lack of willingness or ability for the parents to communicate in order to effectively co-parent with respect to complex long-term issues like sexuality and gender identity, (b) the father is unable or unwilling to reflect upon their behaviours and consider them from the children\u2019s perspectives, and (c) there is an absence of age appropriate focus on the children\u2019s lives. the father is unable or unwilling to reflect upon their behaviours and consider them from the children\u2019s perspectives, and (c) there is an absence of age appropriate focus on the children\u2019s lives. there is an absence of age appropriate focus on the children\u2019s lives. the likelihood of ongoing and escalation of conflict as between the parents is high.

school on tuesday until the start of school on wednesday. each week from after school on tuesday until the start of school on wednesday. the evidence was conceived in 2015 after a one-time encounter with [mr namvar]. [mr namvar] and i were not in a relationship at the time, nor after. there was never a period of time when [mr namvar] was not spending time with [x] regularly, but in 2017, [mr namvar] filed court proceedings despite there was no reason to do so as i was following our original verbal agreement, and the subsequent ones reached by mediation. i am also concerned that there is a risk that [mr namvar] would not return to australia if he took [x] to another country citing that the father does not own property in australia, works for a country g based company, owns property in the country g, has his whole family in the country g, that his son o is 18 years of age and that: ... there are only a few years left before [o\u2019s] siblings are free to move with [mr namvar], is a [country g] citizen and has access to substantial funds. whilst the concerns they each raise have been taken seriously and to identify areas of concern, each parent would be considered \u2018good enough\u2019 and no one better than the other the family report and the evidence of ms ah as the youngest of seven children, [x] has a unique place in her family. she is much younger than her siblings which means that her interests and abilities will be markedly different to theirs over the next 10 to 15 years. that is not to say that she will not have interests in common with her siblings, but, for example, when her siblings are entering the later stages of childhood and begin to have more self-focus or focus outside the family unit open bracket adolescence), she may not have the opportunity to spend as much time with them and so building those relationships now will be important. presented as a confident child and confident in her relationships with her siblings. the sibling relationship can form a lifelong support network if supported during the early years. ... the proposed additional time that [x] will spend with [o], [bb] and [cc] will help to develop those relationships further. if [mr namvar] and [ms pales] do not alter their current approach to one another [x]\u2019s experience will be confusing. she will be aware of her parents\u2019 feelings towards one another and that is likely to make her feel uncomfortable and/or sad. this may lead to poor mental health. children exposed to ongoing parental conflict are highly represented in mental health services and experience conditions like anxiety and depression. it may be helpful for both parents to complete a post separation program or research information that explores the impact of parental conflict on children. ] issue that could arise is what school [x] attendance. [mr namvar] and [ms pales] have not discussed this, but [mr namvar] had assumed that she will attend [suburb aj] school in 2021. [ms pales] has in fact enrolled [x] in [suburb aj] school already. if [x] lives predominantly with [ms pales], she should attend that school. orders that stipulate that she remain at that school unless both parents agree in writing further to change schools may avoid future litigation. orders that stipulate that [x] attend a high school agreed to by both parents, but failing agreement, the high school that she lives in the catchment area for i also avoid further litigation. submissions ... in order to prevent further litigation and the need to return to court for future medical, dental, and education decisions, i am seeking sole parental responsibility for [x]\u2019s medical, dental and education decisions for continuity of her care. it is important that [x] returns to my care at 4pm on alternating sundays in order to provide more stability during the school week for her. this has worked very well for [x]. the law whether the child spending equal time with each parent would be in the best interest of the child,[3] and (b) whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[4] whether the child spending equal time with each of the parents is reasonably practicable.[4] a discretionary judgment concerning the parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition.[6] ] what these definitions convey is that \u201cmeaningful\u201d, when used in the context of \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d, is synonymous with \u201csignificant\u201d which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cof consequence\u201d. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant. ] the act sets out in s 60cc several matters for the court to consider in determining what is in the child\u2019s best interests but does not seek to mandate that any one or other matter becomes determinative in any particular case. for the purposes of this case the legislation requires that there be a primary consideration given to the benefit of the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents but it does not purport to prescribe how that meaningful relationship is best promoted in the circumstances of any one case. and later, at paragraph 36 said: ] it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship. 0] ... to be a meaningful relationship, it must be healthy, worthwhile and advantageous to the child... those adjectives mean that children need their parents to lead by example about self-discipline. children need to learn to develop the ability to relate to others. they need to learn about the privileges and responsibility which will devolve upon them as parents. those are fundamental parts of the meaningful relationship. ... the benefit to be derived by child from sibling relationships is not a matter which could be the subject of judicial notice within section 144 of the evidence act 1995 (cth) a concept that i find sufficiently closely analogous to the benefit to be derived by child from having a meaningful relationship with both parents. it is not open to a judge to use section 144 of the evidence act to \u201cinform\u201d him or herself of matters in respect of which reasonable minds might differ. section 60cc \u2013 the primary considerations section 60cc \u2013 the additional considerations any views expressed by x and any factors (such as x\u2019s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to x\u2019s views the

her parents or from any of her half siblings with whom she has been living the practical difficulty and expense of x spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect x\u2019s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis the capacity of each of x\u2019s parents to provide for the needs of x, including her emotional and intellectual needs the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of x and of x\u2019s parents, and any other

interests under s.90sm of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d) as between the applicant, ms jarrow, and the respondent, mr manard, following the breakdown of their de facto relationship. procedural history 2 the proceedings were commenced on the applicant\u2019s initiating application filed on 4 june 2019. on 11 and 12 june 2020, this court, albeit a different judge, heard an application pursuant to s.90rd of the act for a declaration of the existence of a de facto relationship. ex tempore reasons for judgment were delivered on 12 june 2020, declaring that the parties lived in a de facto relationship commencing in approximately august 2003 and concluding on 10 june 2017: harrow & manard [2020] fcca 2598 (\u201charrow\u201d). the court also made asset preservation orders in respect of the former matrimonial home, namely the property situate at and known as b street, suburb c (\u201cthe b street, suburb c property\u201d). additionally, a costs order was also made against the respondent fixed in the sum of $25,000 to be paid to the applicant within 42 days of the date of those orders. 3 the final hearing of this matter proceeded on 25 september 2020 and 29 january 2021, with written submissions to be filed in accordance with orders dated 29 january 2021, following which the court reserved its decision. competing claims 4 the applicant sought an order that the respondent pay her the sum of $148,000 or equivalent to between 55% to 57.5% of the net asset pool (after add backs), and in default thereof that the b street, suburb c property be listed for sale and that she receive such payment from the net proceeds of sale. further, the applicant, in addition to costs incidental to this application, seeks orders for the payment of $12,500, being the costs which remain unpaid to the applicant by the respondent pursuant to orders made by this court on 12 june 2020, and that she be entitled to be paid 20% of the respondent\u2019s superannuation interests (being approximately $22,000). 5 the respondent, on the other hand, whilst conceding that it would be just and equitable to make orders altering the parties\u2019 property interests, seeks orders that he pay the applicant the sum of $40,000 and transfer the sum of $13,147 to the applicant from his superannuation interests. save for the costs ordered on 12 june 2020, the respondent further seeks that each party pay their own costs. 6 there was significant focus at hearing, understandably and appropriately so, on a not insubstantial number of post separation transactions undertaken by the respondent. these transactions amounted to a total of over $300,000. the applicant was required, due to the respondent\u2019s lack of proper explanation and full and frank disclosure, to trawl through over 600 pages of financial documents in order to ascertain the respondent\u2019s post separation spending and use of funds. the detailed forensic work undertaken by and on behalf of the applicant in this regard, no doubt came at a significant cost, both in terms of the time required and also in terms of legal costs and disbursements. legal principles 7 the overall approach to the determination of an application for property adjustment orders was set out by the high court in stanford v stanford [2012] hca 52 (see in particular [37] to [42]). the high court recorded three fundamental propositions. the first was the need to identify existing legal and equitable interests, the second was that those interests can only be altered by a principled application of judicial discretion, and the third was that, the requirement that the court must not make any order, unless it is satisfied that in all of the circumstances it is just and equitable to make the order, requires separate consideration and should not be conflated with the statutory considerations required to be taken into consideration as to what order, if any, should be made (oamra & williams [2021] famcafc 117 at [35]). 8 such approach was subsequently considered by the full court of the family court in bevan & bevan [2014] famcafc 19 (\u201cbevan\u201d), chapman & chapman [2014] famcafc 91 and scott & danton [2014] famcafc 203. such an approach is also applicable to proceedings pursuant to the de facto relationships provisions of the act, namely part viiiab (see for example peters & walker [2015] famca 732). 9 as such, once the issue of whether it is just and equitable to make any order is resolved, the court is to then consider the contributions made by the parties as defined in s.90sm(4)(a) to (c), the matters set out in s.90sm(4)(d) to (g) and in particular the subjective considerations as to the parties by having regard to the provisions of s.90sf(3) in so far as they are relevant. 10 the court is then to consider the justice and equity of the actual orders to be made, in the context of the court\u2019s obligations to make appropriate orders as provided for in s.90sm(1) of the act (see generally russell & russell [1999] famca 1875, (1999) flc 92-877, teal & teal [2010] famcafc 120, but in the context of s.79). 11 the just and equitable requirement is \u201cone permeating the entire process\u201d (bevan at [86]). 12 the court is not limited in its exercise of discretion to the parties\u2019 respective applications and it is not bound by the orders sought. ultimately any order which the court makes must not only be just and equitable, but it must be made in the proper exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. add-backs 13 in trevi & trevi [2018] famcafc 173 (\u201ctrevi\u201d) at [27] \u2013 [30] the full court of the family court held as follows: 27. the full court held in omacini and omacini that addbacks fall into \u201cthree clear categories\u201d: where the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and \u201cwaste\u201d or want on, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets. 28. however, the full court also made it clear that an addback does not necessarily occur whenever \u201ca party has expended money realised from the disposition of assets that existed as at the date of separation\u201d, the full court describing such a proposition as \u201cunduly simplistic\u201d. an earlier full court made the same point, saying that adding back is \u201cthe exception rather than the rule\u201d. 29. the fundamental precept that addbacks are exceptional, reflected in the decisions just referred to, also mirrors what has been said in earlier decisions of the full court that, for example, \u201cthe family court must take the property of a party to the marriage as it finds it\u201d at trial. an important parallel proposition is that the parties do not \u201cgo into a state of suspended economic animation\u201d after separation. thus, reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of addback. 30. two fundamental premises emerge from omacini and the authorities preceding it. first, \u201cadding back\u201d is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not \u201cexceptional\u201d justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion \u2013 usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is \u201ca course which is, perhaps, technically more correct\u201d than adding back to the list of existing interests in property. (citations omitted) relevant facts 14 the applicant was born in 1975. she is 46 years old. 15 the respondent was born in 1979. he is 42 years old. 16 the parties met in 2002 and commenced cohabitation in 2003. the parties lived together continuously until they separated on 10 june 2017, save for a brief separation period in 2009 (see harrow at [142]). 17 the parties lived in a number of rental properties in greater western sydney for the first nine years of their relationship. in 2013, the parties moved into b street, suburb c property which was purchased and registered solely in the respondent\u2019s name. 18 the parties have two children together, m born in 2005 and j born in 2007. 19 the parties have never held a bank account in joint names. contributions at the commencement of relationship 20 at the commencement of the relationship the parties had minimal assets. the applicant had a car worth approximately $1000 and minimal savings. the respondent also had a car, minimal savings and a $3000 debt in unpaid driving fines. 21 the respondent worked as a labourer earning around $500 per week. the applicant worked four days a week as a carer earing around $400 per week. 22 the applicant deposes that initially the parties pooled their earning for rent, utilities, groceries and nights out together but maintained separate bank accounts. contributions during the parties\u2019 relationship 23 the respondent contends that throughout the relationship he paid the household expenses including groceries, utilities, rent, and later mortgage payments and rates for the b street, suburb c property. he explained that the applicant would use his key card to pay household expenses such as groceries. 24 the applicant ceased paid employment sometime in 2005 after she fell pregnant and assumed the role of homemaker. as homemaker, the applicant took on most of the caring responsibilities as well as cooking and cleaning. the applicant concedes that the respondent occasionally helped with bathing and changing nappies as well as with gardening, home maintenance and vacuuming. 25 in 2007, the respondent was in a motorcycle accident which resulted in a month long stay in hospital followed by a 6 month recovery period at home. the applicant assumed all homemaker duties and cared for the respondent and the children during this period. 26 between 2006 and 2012, the applicant commenced and completed her tertiary studies to become an educator. she graduated with a bachelor degree in 2013 and a masters in 2014. 27 during the applicant\u2019s studies she was in receipt of centrelink benefits, which according to her evidence this was used to pay the parties\u2019 rent. the applicant provided money directly to the respondent by withdrawing cash from her account and depositing it into his account. 28 the respondent submits that he contributed to the welfare of the family during this time, by supporting the applicant to complete her tertiary studies, who emerged from the relationship with an occupation which will provide her with a secure and stable income in the future. 29 the following were findings made in harrow: during cross-examination, mr manard conceded that ms jarrow bought groceries and met the children\u2019s expenses. [162] i accept ms jarrow\u2019s evidence that during that period, and thus, by reference to the earlier periods, consistently also then, that she was providing money directly to mr manard by depositing money into his account. in addition, she was, notwithstanding the assertion across all three affidavits affirmed by mr manard, purchasing groceries and meeting the children\u2019s expenses, as led by him in his cross-examination. it does mr manard\u2019s credit no good. it does ms jarrow\u2019s credit a world of good. [168] ms jarrow used that money (centrelink) to meet grocery and other expenses within the household. [208] 30 the applicant recommenced paid employment as a casual educator in mid-2014 earning an annual salary of $80,000. the applicant would transfer half her wage in cash to the respondent (approximately $950 a fortnight) to cover the cost of the mortgage and bills. the balance of her income was used for groceries and care of the children. 31 the applicant purports that the division of labour around the home did not change much despite both parties undertaking paid employment. the maternal grandfather assisted the applicant with the school drop off and pick up. 32 in 2016 the respondent started v pty ltd. the respondent has worked as a sole trader. the applicant was a guarantor for a business loan of $66,250.00. she also contributed with some of the company branding, bookkeeping and undertook an industry course. the b street, suburb c property 33 the b street, suburb c property was shared by each of the parties for their mutual use and benefit and the benefit of their children from june 2013 to 10 june 2017. 34 the applicant contends that the b street, suburb c property was a jointly purchased asset and should be part of the asset pool. the respondent contends that he purchased the property without any financial contribution from the applicant. 35 it is applicant\u2019s evidence that she contributed $8,000 which was gifted to her from her parents in lieu of contributing to her wedding. she is unable to distinctly recall whether the money was deposited into the respondent\u2019s account or his mother\u2019s account. the respondent contends that it is implausible that the applicant would not recall how she deposited the $8,000. 36 as noted by the court in harrow at [182] the $18,000 received from the respondent\u2019s mother was deposited into his account on the same day that the applicant received a payment of $8,000 from her parents. contributions post separation 37 post-separation, the respondent has continued to live in the property and continues to meet all the mortgage repayments, outgoings and insurances on the property. 38 the applicant contends that following the relationship breakdown she has taken on 100% of the care of the children. 39 the children spend time with their father in accordance with their wishes. the respondent spends time with j most weekends which often includes overnight time. the respondent spends less time with m, approximately 1-2 times a month and this rarely includes overnight time. the applicant is content with this arrangement. the court has not been asked to make orders in regards to parenting. 40 the children presently attend a private catholic school where the school fees for both children are approximately $7,200 per year and up until 2020 was paid for by the respondent. according to the respondent this arrangement was in accordance with an informal child support agreement. in august 2020, the applicant was contacted by the children\u2019s school and was told that the fees for 2020 remain outstanding. 41 the applicant states that she pays for most of the children\u2019s extra-curricular activities which costs approximately $500 to $1,000 per child each year. the respondent pays for j\u2019s soccer. she also covers the children\u2019s medical bills, including m\u2019s visits to the psychologist which occur every three weeks and cost $180 and j\u2019s braces which she pays for in fortnightly instalments of $100 over the course of three years. 42 the applicant annexes to her affidavit sworn 28 august 2020 an email dated 8 november 2019 from mr w of x school to the applicant explaining that the father contacted the school and requested that he not be contacted regarding the daily academic management of his children. 43 in her financial statement filed 2 september 2020, the applicant discloses that she has a full-time educator position and earns a yearly salary of approximately $92,500. she rents a home with her sister and their children for which she pays $615 per fortnight. she also has personal expenditure totalling $450 per fortnight. the applicant states that she cannot afford to live independently. value of the asset pool and determination of contributions 44 in stanford, the high court emphasised as fundamental that a consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order begins by \u201cidentifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property\u201d (trevi at [46]). what liabilities are to be included in the pool? 45 the parties are in dispute as to whether a number of liabilities should be included on the balance sheet. 46 the applicant is indebted to ms jarrow for funds lent to her on account of legal fees. this amount will not be included in the balance sheet. for similar reasons, the respondent\u2019s debt to ms g will not be included in the balance sheet. 47 the applicant has identified liabilities, which she submits should not be included in the pool as they are liabilities which were incurred in the company name, following separation, and without consultation of the applicant. in his written submissions the respondent agrees that the below listed items should not be included in the pool: 48 by virtue of the same reasoning, the assets which are assets of v pty ltd will not be included in the pool as stand-alone assets, but rather as part of the value assigned to the company. 49 the parties agree that the outstanding amount of costs payable by the respondent to the applicant pursuant to orders made on 12 june 2020 is not to be included in the pool. an order requiring the respondent to pay this amount is also proposed by each of the parties. add-backs? 50 the applicant has identified the following sums as moneys prematurely disposed of and unaccounted for into the property pool to satisfy the applicant\u2019s claim: 51 there is no issue that the respondent drew down $45,176 from the home loan secured against the b street, suburb c property in june 2019, when he refinanced the previous home loan and borrowed an additional amount over the then existing home loan debt. this increased the debt secured over the b street, suburb c property to $364,000. the respondent gave evidence that he spent this money on entertainment, gambling and shopping. in all of the circumstances, these were not reasonable living costs of the respondent, notwithstanding the submissions made on his behalf in this regard. 52 at the time his earnings were more than sufficient to cover his living expenses, noting the representations he made to the lender at the time that the loan was approved. while the court notes the respondent\u2019s evidence that the amount was something that was simply put there by his loan broker, he is the person who signed the application and declared as to the truth of his financial position at the time. if he was dishonest at the time he declared his financial position to the lender, he cannot now benefit by virtue of that deception and dishonesty. 53 the amount of $262,578 is made up of various amounts spent by the respondent during the period july 2017 to may 2020. there was little to no explanation provided in the respondent\u2019s evidence in chief about such spending. the respondent was asked questions about the details of his spending and by and large the moneys were spent on gambling, legal fees, repairs to the prime mover and the purchase of a motor vehicle 2: the motor vehicle 2 was purchased a short time after separation, and it is likely that the moneys for its purchase came from pre-separation funds. that motor vehicle was later written off by the insurer and the respondent received an insurance payment of $49,650 for the car, the prime mover is an asset of v pty ltd, and any repairs to the truck were liabilities of the company not the respondent. if he paid for the repairs, then the company is liable to him for the costs of those repairs. the truck was purchased during the relationship and it was written off post separation, with the respondent receiving an insurance payment of $41,950 in 2020, gambling and other alleged ordinary expenses were in the circumstances excessive and unreasonable, and the legal fees paid by the respondent from moneys which can be traced back to funds or assets held by the parties pre-separation ought to properly be added back to the pool. the difficulty here is that the respondent\u2019s evidence is most unsatisfactory as to the source of funds for the payment of his legal fees, and the court is not able to make particular findings about such funds. 54 in respect of the rest of the moneys forming the balance of the $262,578, some of those moneys came from an insurance payout for a work injury suffered in 2015 and 2016, prior to the parties\u2019 separation. 55 there appears to be significant intermingling of payments associated with v pty ltd and other payments which were made by the respondent personally, such as gambling and legal fees. there is an apparent repayment and overpayment of a loan to the respondent\u2019s current partner. 56 the motor vehicle 2, after it was written off, was sold by the respondent to his partner for $6,700 and those funds have all dissipated. 57 the respondent has also drawn down on his superannuation during the covid-19 pandemic in the amount permitted by the federal government at the time as an early release payment. such payments were only available in certain circumstances, to support people whose finances were adversely impacted by covid-19. the respondent did not disclose the withdrawal of the $10,000 from his superannuation until cross-examination. 58 the court finds that the amounts identified above were utilised by the respondent post separation without any recourse or accounting to the applicant, and that the respondent has not been fully frank about such spending. furthermore, even with requests for particular documents to be disclosed, the respondent has been recalcitrant in respect of his obligations for full and frank disclosure. in such circumstances, the court will not be overly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party (weir & weir [1992] famca 69). 59 while the court is aware of the authorities such as kowaliw & kowaliw [1981] famca 70 and that it is not normally appropriate years after separation to require each of the parties to account for monies spent after separation so as to determine whether such expenditure was reasonably necessary, and if it was not, to determine whether it would be proper to add it back into the pool, in the circumstances of this case it is more appropriate that the respondent\u2019s post-separation spending be considered in light of s.90sf(3) factors, and in particular pursuant to s.90sf(3)(r). the pool 60 at the time of final hearing, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in property are as follows: assessment of contributions 61 the parties were in a relationship of almost 14 years, during which time they had two children together. m, who is now 16 years old and j who is 14 years old. since the parties separated in june 2017, the children have lived with the applicant and she has been their primary carer. 62 at the commencement of the parties\u2019 relationship, they both worked for a modest wage, and after the birth of their first child the applicant took on the role of homemaker and parent. the applicant made significant and substantial contributions as homemaker and also made indirect contributions in facilitating the respondent\u2019s business and business undertakings and the parties\u2019 progression to home ownership. 63 the respondent took on the role of primary breadwinner, and during periods of time when the applicant was not earning any income he was the sole income earner. in 2010, the respondent received an inheritance. the amount of the inheritance and how it was spent was the subject of some evidence in the respondent\u2019s case, but like much of his evidence it was not particularly enlightening. 64 during the parties\u2019 relationship, the applicant undertook tertiary studies to become an educator, completing those studies with a master\u2019s degree in 2014. she arranged her studies around the care of the children and her other homemaker responsibilities. the respondent worked and supported the family financially during this period. the applicant has a hecs debt consequent upon her studies. after she completed her tertiary studies, the applicant was employed on a casual basis in 2014, but from 2015 she has held a permanent position. 65 after the respondent\u2019s motorcycle accident, the applicant cared for and supported the respondent. 66 the respondent has worked in various roles during the parties\u2019 relationship, as a labourer, factory worker and then self-employed in the transport business operating through v pty ltd. the applicant assisted with the establishment of v pty ltd, including by taking out a joint loan. 67 while the former matrimonial home was purchased in the respondent\u2019s sole name, there was financial contributions made by each of the parties towards the purchase, including from joint savings and made on their behalf by their parents. in the context of the myriad of other contributions over the 14 years of cohabitation, the precise financial contributions towards the purchase price of the b street, suburb c property is not a matter of any particular or significant weight. 68 post separation, the applicant has made and continues to make the overwhelming contribution to the care and welfare of the parties\u2019 children. the respondent has made some financial contributions towards their care and maintenance and has spent limited time with the children. 69 the respondent on the other hand, while remaining in the b street, suburb c property, has made all of the financial and non-financial contributions in respect of that property but by the same token he has had a significant benefit of living there while the applicant has had to find suitable accommodation for herself and the children. 70 both parties submit that the court should take a global approach to the assessment of contributions, and there is an agreement that the parties\u2019 contributions were broadly equivalent, although each argues that his/her contribution was slightly greater than the other\u2019s. 71 given the length of the relationship, the parties\u2019 contributions according to their respective roles and abilities, a holistic or global approach is in all of the circumstances appropriate: norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17 (at [16] per mason deanne jj). 72 overall, the contributions are assessed as slightly favouring the applicant, in large due to her overwhelming post separation contributions towards the care of the parties\u2019 children. on a holistic assessment, the contributions of the parties are assessed at 55% to the applicant and 45% to the respondent. section 90sf(3) considerations 73 the parties are of similar ages, although the applicant is slightly older than the respondent. the respondent submits that the injuries he suffered to his knees and hips adversely affect his capacity to drive for lengthy periods of time and thus adversely affect his earning capacity. there is no probative evidence to support such a submission, and the respondent\u2019s taxable income does not reflect any diminishment in earnings which might have been expected as a result of a diminished capacity to work. 74 the applicant has a taxable income which since 2017 to 2020 has been in sum total higher than the respondent\u2019s taxable income. the applicant is in stable and secure employment, and there is every likelihood that she will continue to earn an income until her retirement. this will also mean that her superannuation will grow due to compulsory employer contributions. 75 the respondent has retained the business and the company and he is the sole director and share-holder of the company. in the circumstances of this case he has control over its business operation and its assets, and he is able to benefit from the corporate structure. the company is his alter-ego and the respondent is able to and does, structure the company\u2019s business and taxation affairs in a way that benefits him personally. 76 the applicant will continue to have the majority care of the parties\u2019 children, and she will continue to be financially responsible for them. the respondent is likely to also make financial contributions towards the children, in a manner similar to what he has done in the past. 77 post separation, the respondent has spent over $300,000. such amounts cannot be and have not been explained by his taxable earnings. they were of a significant benefit to the respondent. while some of the payments received by the respondent during the relevant period are unlikely to be reproduced such that the court would not be able to infer that the respondent will have similar benefits into the future, the money spent by the respondent during the post separation period to date of final hearing is nonetheless a relevant consideration pursuant to s.90sf(3)(r) as is the respondent\u2019s lack of disclosure about such matters, as noted earlier in these reasons. 78 in all of the circumstances, and once again taking a holistic approach in line with authorities such as chapman (at [39]), there is to be a further adjustment in the applicant\u2019s favour by virtue of s.90sf(3) factors of 12%. overall adjustment 79 based on the findings made as to contributions and further adjustment, the court has assessed that there should be a 67% adjustment in favour of the applicant and a 33% adjustment in favour of the respondent. that is, the applicant is to receive assets to the value of $150,044 and the respondent $73,903. 80 both parties seek a superannuation splitting order. the order sought by the applicant is in all of the circumstances, just and equitable and it is an order in respect of which the relevant superannuation trustee has been provided with procedural fairness. 81 as such, the applicant takes: 82 as such, the respondent takes: 83 the parties each propose that the respondent retain the b street, suburb c property but that he pay the applicant a cash adjustment. this is what the orders will provide for at first instance. in all of the circumstances, such an outcome is just and equitable. it will allow the applicant the benefit of a cash adjustment while allowing the respondent the benefit of retaining the property. 84 however, if the respondent is not able to make such payment within 42 days the property will be sold and the applicant will then be paid out from the proceeds of sale. there is currently $144,239 equity in the property, based on the agreed value at final hearing. the payment to the applicant is roughly 98% of that equity. 85 if the property is to be sold, the minimum payment to the applicant will be $141,462. if the property is sold for an amount greater than $500,000 the applicant will be paid $141,462 plus an additional 67% of the difference between the sale price and $500,000. if the property is sold for less than the agreed value (which is unlikely) then the applicant will still take $141,462 or if net proceeds are less, the entirety of the net proceeds and the shortfall will remain payable by the respondent. in all of the circumstances, it is just and equitable that the applicant receive the benefit of the adjustments made pursuant to these orders. 86 each of the parties will retain superannuation and given their ages and earning capacities, such superannuation will likely continue to accrue until the parties reach retirement. 87 in all of the circumstances, the result is just and equitable. costs 88 the applicant moves the court for an order that the respondent pay her costs of these proceedings. neither party has made submissions to the court as to why a costs order should or should not be made, nor have the parties addressed the court as to quantum. 89 the parties have 28 days from the date of the orders to apply to the court for a costs order pursuant to rule 12.13 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 (cth). if costs are pressed, it may be appropriate for such an application to be dealt with on the papers. 90 for all of those reasons, orders as set out at the forefront of these reasons for judgment are made. associate: dated: 29 october 2021", "metadata": {"filename": "96.txt", "size": 46499, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 46864,

significantly less time with her will not be in their best interests. she added that both children have since made disclosures of concern to a range of sources (such as the australian federal police, their previous school, peers, and doctor) and will continue to run away if they remain primarily with father.[2] whilst it is acknowledged, and agreed upon with [ms bruckner], that the children should be provided with opportunities to express their views, significant concern continues to be raised that the children\u2019s views do not present as entirely their own, and remain inconsistent with their interactions with their father. as such, weight has not been given to the children\u2019s expressed views in these circumstances. it is acknowledged that the children love their mother, and seek to spend time with her. given the nature of their entrenched views, and continued pressure to present the father in a negative light, however, it is believed that they require time to continue to focus upon the strengthening of their relationships with him, as well as time to internalise that they are allowed to love him and to enjoy time spent with him. it is considered crucial to focus on the father-child relationship at the present time, whilst the children are still at an age where they can continue to connect positively with him, before they move forward into their teenage years, when they are likely to become more independent in their views, or further influenced by other external factors. as such, it would seem appropriate for [x] and [y] to maintain telephone contact (supervised) with the mother at present, such as weekly, to occur at a specific time on a specific day (to work around with their other commitments) for a period of six months, as well as letters, cards or presents (such as in relation to the upcoming mother\u2019s day), prior to consideration of face to face time-spending occurring in the future.[3] the issues in the case the issue of the children not regularly attending school was a matter of concern to the father and to the icl. it was at least one of the considerations as to why the final parenting orders were made, that provided for the father to have sole parental responsibility and also for the transition of the children from the primary care of the mother, to the primary care of the father. the concern raised by [dr dd], of his observations of the children\u2019s extreme reluctance to now engage with the father and even their fear of returning to school lest the father attend and attempt to retake the children back into his care, is at stark odds with the evidence. i found that the evidence of the family consultant, in terms of the observations of the beneficial relationship between the children and the father, was such that the children presented without any concern after having spent time with him. the mother\u2019s position that the children were fearful of the father, was not supported by the evidence generally or the specific evidence of the family consultant. ....... it is of concern that the mother would have resorted to taking the children to [dr dd]in circumstances where part of that issue related to the children not attending school and the mother not complying with the final parenting orders. they are matters to which sole parental responsibility would ordinarily have been a significant matter. i am not satisfied that the medical certificates provided by [dr dd] provide the explanation as to why the children have not been at school. what is behind that, is not the medical health of the children but rather the obvious understanding by the mother that were the children to attend their school, there would be then no impediment to the father collecting them pursuant to the final parenting order. the mother also had no confidence that the teachers and staff at the children\u2019s school would do anything other than fall in with the father\u2019s ability to have the final parenting orders complied with. it is also a relevant factor that, notwithstanding that the children have been in the sole care of the mother since 17 august 2022, no application was made to attempt to regularise the arrangement or to put in place a different arrangement. it is only the father\u2019s initiating application that brings the mother to the court\u2019s attention. what has now happened, is that there has been unilateral action taken by the mother to cause a change in the circumstances of the children without any regard to the effect that it would have on them. in circumstances where i made detailed findings as to the nature of the relationship between the children and their father, it is alarming that the mother should now have placed the children in the circumstance where they no longer have a relationship with him.[6] the department has completed an investigation into the care afforded to [x] and [y] and has assessed that the children\u2019s care arrangement with [mr merritt] is safe. the department is concerned that as of 31 january 2023 the children re-entered the care of [ms bruckner] and [ms bruckner] refused to cooperate with the department to have the children returned to [mr merritt]. to assist the court a detailed summary of the departmental investigation is attached.[15] upon noting: a. justice kari has a conflict and is unable to hear the matter. the department for child protection (\u201cdcp\u201d) provided a response to the court pursuant to the s91b order made on 23 november 2022. such report is dated 1 february

assessment ordered on 21 december 2022, with the first of such appointments scheduled for 8 march 2023. the icl has indicated to the court that the father has responded to the icl\u2019s request to contribute one half of the costs of [ms h\u2019s] report but as yet the mother has not yet done so noting that the mother indicates that she has not received any communications from the icl in that regard. that the court has been advised by the icl and the parties today as to the following circumstances in relation to the children: both children attended school on friday, 3 february 2023. the child [y] was returned to the father\u2019s primary care on 3 february 2023. the child [x] has remained in the mother\u2019s primary care. neither of the children have attended school since 3 february 2023. the icl is concerned that the children are not attending school and they are not spending time with each other and/or communicating with each other. the dcp have not yet determined whether they intend to take up the court\u2019s request to intervene in the proceedings. either way: the dcp intend to continue to actively engage with the family during the period of the adjournment. the dcp have requested that the mother personally and otherwise facilitate the child [x] engaging with the dcp. that the father has made appointments for both children to see a psychologist on 10 february 2023 and

order, or a notation, that i will release that document by email to each you and [mr merritt] at the conclusion of today\u2019s hearing so that you have that document. otherwise, can i understand this, and just give me one moment. [mr merritt], you filed \u2013 just stand up for me, please. you filed a fresh initiating application in the matter in october of last year. that application in part had a focus of the recovery order which his honour then dealt with. otherwise i think the balance of the orders have been dealt with in terms of the reappointment of the independent children\u2019s lawyer and some other issues. but there are other orders in that document which have never been dealt with that you seek. i am also conscious that the mother filed an application in a proceeding in november which also hasn\u2019t formally been dealt with. in terms of how i procedurally manage the matter, what i am inclined to do \u2013 and there are two options as to how i deal with it. but i think i will do because those applications are now old, both yours and the mother\u2019s from november \u2013 and i am addressing this to you as well, [ms bruckner]. because those documents are old and there has been a considerable change of \u2013 and series of events since then, what i am inclined to do, [mr merritt], is require you to file \u2013 and i will work out the timeframe in a moment, but a fresh application in a proceeding setting out the interim orders you\u2019re asking the court to make, together with an affidavit in support, and you can update the court as to all that has occurred in the intervening period. i will then require the mother to file a response to that application in a proceeding, together with her affidavit in support, where she can put the material that she wants before the court. the plan then will be to dismiss all previous outstanding interim applications and there will just be the fresh applications that are filed pursuant to the orders i propose to make today. you\u2019re nodding your head. you seem to follow that. [mr merritt]: i \u2013 sorry, your honour. yes. her honour: are you content with that procedural course of action? [mr merritt]: yes, your honour her honour: all right. thank you, [mr merritt]. have a seat. [ms bruckner], you\u2019ve just heard my explanation as to the procedural orders i plan to make. are you content with that course of action, to bring the matter up to date so that each, you and [mr merritt], have the opportunity to put the documents that you want before the court so that a judge can hear, whatever the current orders are, an argument in relation to the current orders that you are each asking the court to make. [ms bruckner]: that makes sense, your honour, to do that, and i also would just like to put forward that i seek to issue a subpoena, your honour, and i was hoping that we could do that in these procedural orders as well.[16] only ran from the school and hurt her foot on the 3 february 2023 because she was being chased by [ms ae] from dcp and others. [ms ae]'s actions and the children being unnecessarily pulled out of class are the reason [x] got upset and ran from school and nearly ran into a car. [x] said she was happily in class prior to her being pulled out of class and sent to the office. the mother contacted the principal and he confirmed that he had no control over dcp pulling the kids out of class and doing what they did.[19] the nature of an interim hearing decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing. the assessment of risk is one of the many burdens placed on family law decision makers. risk assessment comprises two elements \u2013 the first requires prediction of the likelihood of the occurrence of harmful events, and the second requires consideration of the severity of the impact caused by those events. in our view, the assessment of risk in cases involving the welfare of children cannot be postponed until the last piece of evidence is given and tested, and the last submission is made. we accept, however, that it is always a question of degree depending on the evidence that is before the court. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue. the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term \u2018unacceptable risk\u2019. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable. legal principles relating to parenting proceedings a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents, and b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. aving a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child\u2019s best interests.[33] parental responsibility how the court applies these principles in the context of an interim hearing the dcp report of 1 february 2023 on 31 january 2023, the department received a notification that [x] and [y] absconded from school grounds and that [x] asked another student \u2018can you bring my bag down to my mums house after school\u2019. [ms bruckner] later phoned the school advising that the federal police had advised her to communicate the children\u2019s whereabouts and confirmed the children were in her care. [ms bruckner] also alleged that [y] had diarrhoea. also on this date, the department received a further child protection notification outlining that police attended [ms bruckner]\u2019s property and sighted both [x] and [y] in her care. police reportedly met with [ms bruckner] and her friend who insisted that they record the entire interaction. it was reported that the children appeared influenced by [ms bruckner] and their responses \u2018came across scripted\u2019. [ms bruckner] made allegations that [y] appeared underweight however the notification indicates police held no concerns for the children\u2019s physical presentation. the notification outlined that [ms bruckner] was \u2018controlled yet confrontational with police and extremely persistent in giving her side of the story\u2019. at approximately 5:00pm on 31 january 2023, the department attended [ms bruckner]\u2019s home. upon arrival [ms bruckner] presented as combative and expressed that she was unwilling to speak with departmental workers unless she had another person present. [ms bruckner] refused to open the front screen door, would not allow departmental workers to sight the home and also appeared to be recording departmental workers on her mobile phone. the department explained that [ms bruckner] is currently contravening federal court orders and there are concerns in relation to the children remaining in her care. [ms bruckner] made comments that she is aware of what the allocated departmental worker has been saying to the children. when asked to elaborate on this [ms bruckner] alleged that the departmental worker told [x] \u2018it doesn\u2019t matter what you say no one will listen\u2019. the departmental worker advised this comment was never made to [x] and advised that the department need to sight the children. [ms bruckner] proceeded to call both [x] and [y] to the front door and stated to [x] \u2018is this the lady you were telling me about\u2019. [ms bruckner] then proceeding to say to [x] in a forceful manner \u2018tell the lady what you told me before, tell her\u2019. [x] appeared to hesitate and unsure what [ms bruckner] was referring to and the departmental worker advised [ms bruckner] that this discussion is not appropriate to have in front of the children. [ms bruckner] then stated \u2018no [x] is old enough to hear this\u2019. [ms bruckner] continued pressuring [x] to speak to the departmental workers and [x] recalled that in response to her comments about wanting to kill herself the departmental worker responded \u2018i\u2019m sorry to hear that\u2019. department worker confirmed this was the response given to [x]. the department went on to advise that they need to conduct a safety check of the home including sighting the children\u2019s bedrooms. [ms bruckner] became further heightened at this stating that the department need a court order to complete this and slammed the door on workers. the department assessed that further attempts to interact with [ms bruckner] on this day would only serve to expose the children to further conflict. the department remains in support of justice mead\u2019s decision to place the children in [mr merritt]\u2019s primary care and are concerned for [x] and [y]\u2019s emotional wellbeing should they remain in [ms bruckner]\u2019s care. concerns exists in relation to [ms bruckner]\u2019s inability to ensure the children\u2019s school attendance and is unlikely to facilitate the children\u2019s engagement with a psychologist for an appointment booked on 10 february 2023 (arranged by [mr merritt]). [ms bruckner]\u2019s presentation on 31 january 2023, further indicates she has no regard for the children\u2019 emotional safety and actively seeks to involve the children in inappropriate conversations. the department recommends that [x] and [y]\u2019s return to the care of [mr merritt] and further recommends that [mr merritt] is allowed to change the children\u2019s school enrolment to embed the children\u2019s support network within the safety of the fathers care environment and area.[39] he department accepts the honourable court\u2019s position in relation to [ms bruckner] and the risk she poses to [x] and [y]\u2019s emotional and psychological safety therefore would not be supportive of the children being in [ms bruckner]\u2019s care. in particular the department has significant concerns in relation to [ms bruckner]\u2019s inability to meet the children\u2019s education and health needs as outlined within the judgement dated 27 october 2022. further to this, the department is concerned that, [x] in particular, appears fixated with painting [mr merritt] and [ms f] in negative light and views this likely as a result of [x]\u2019s exposure to [ms bruckner]\u2019s own views of the father\u2019s household. the department currently has no concerns in relation to the level of care provided by [mr merritt] and [ms f] to [x] and [y]. issues raised by [x] and [y] during their interviews appear to stem from their relationship being fractured potentially by the narrative provided to them by [ms bruckner]. concerns raised by [x] revolve around food issues, [mr merritt] drinking wine and not assisting [x] with her sleep. these issues do not constitute as child protection concerns and the department considers that [mr merritt] and [ms f] are well equipped to re-build a trusting relationship with both [x] and [y]. the department has observed [mr merritt] and [ms f] to remain child focussed and genuinely interested and concerned about the children\u2019s welfare. it is the department\u2019s recommendation that before time spending is reinstated between the children and [ms bruckner], that [ms bruckner] participate in a psychiatric mental health assessment. the department considers information from such assessment is best placed to inform decisions around contact arrangements. the department\u2019s concern, which is mirrored by [mr merritt], is that should [ms bruckner] be granted contact with [x] and [y], [ms bruckner] may withhold the children resulting in further emotional harm or seek to disrupt the children\u2019s stability with [mr merritt]. the department supports the honourable court\u2019s assessment and finding that \u2018the best interest of the children would be served by them remaining in the primary care of the father\u2019. the department will support the honourable court in the change of care environment back to [mr merritt] where possible. the department also considers it important that [mr merritt] be allowed to re-enrol the children into a local area school.[40] ms ag\u2019s report and evidence acknowledged that it was good to speak with [ms bruckner] recently, but was clear that she would prefer to see her in person. she also reasoned that if the children were told the date when they will see her again, they would have something to look forward to, and would be happier if aware of when it will occur. [x] was also keen to know when they will return to [ms bruckner], and expressed some frustration that no-one has been able to answer this for her.[41] would like to see [ms bruckner]\u201ctomorrow\u201d and to stay with her \u201cforever\u201d. when asked about when he would see his father, y said \u201cmaybe later\u201d. [y] acknowledged he worries \u201ca lot\u201d about [ms bruckner], such as about \u201chow she\u2019s feeling\u201d, and whether she is feeling \u201csad and worried\u201d about them. he acknowledged he and [x] ran away from school after \u201cdad was being really mean\u201d by \u201cscreaming at us\u201d. he was unable to recall why his father had screamed, but recalled feeling \u201cangry\u201d and missing [ms bruckner] at this time. he said that no-one had encouraged him or [x] to run away.[42] as with x, it was y\u2019s position that the children alone who had initiated leaving school on 31 january 2023, which had subsequently precipitated the involvement of dcp with the family. he will follow court orders, and will tell the children they must spend time with the father, as ordered, even if they do not want to go.[43] and [y] presented as settled when they attended the registry childcare area with [mr merritt]. [y] explored pretend play activities whilst [x] remained close to [mr merritt]. he reassured her that everything would be okay and told her he would return soon. [x] commented, \u201cyay!\u201d in response to him returning soon, and gave him a warm hug, reciprocated by him, before he left whilst [y] remained in the pretend play area. when [mr merritt] returned to collect the children, [y] exclaimed, \u201cdad!\u201d excitedly, and immediately ran and jumped up onto him and hugged him, with [mr merritt] holding him up and returning the affection. [x] bounced on a fitball and asked her father to pull her up, which he did by her arm. she stood close to him, and he affectionately patted her arm, to which she responded positively. the brief interactions between the children and [mr merritt] presented as comfortable, relaxed and natural.[44] during interview, [x] and [y] continued to voice negative views of [mr merritt], and they both presented as unable to acknowledge anything positive about him, or about their time with him. this is in direct contrast to the brief informal observations of their interactions with him in the childcare area, which presented as comfortable, warm, and natural. in addition, whilst the children raised concern about their father and stepmother, such as [y] reporting that the father yells, or [x] reporting that the stepmother tries to act in a motherly way by checking she is okay when hurt, this did not seem to be outside of what may be considered fairly standard parenting. the children also did not provide very detailed accounts in their negative descriptions of their father. whilst [y] commented that his father becomes \u201cdrunk\u201d, he did not provide examples of behaviour consistent with this view. the writer was led to query the potential of negative influence by the mother, consistent with prior information from multiple sources (such as previous family assessment report, dcp information, past judgments). in addition, concern was raised with regard to the extent in which this may have occurred, given the fixed nature of the children\u2019s responses, when they have had limited contact with their mother recently.[45] as such, future time-spending between [ms bruckner] and the children is likely to be contingent upon the positive progress of such therapy, in addition to the positive progress of telephone calls during this time. it is also considered that if, or when, time-spending recommences in the future, it occurs supervised (at least initially), to ensure that [ms bruckner]\u2019s responses to the children remain child-focussed and appropriate.[46] legal principles relating to the disqualification of the icl once it is understood that the icl\u2019s primary responsibilities and duties as a legal practitioner (albeit a legal practitioner charged with onerous, particular responsibilities) remain essentially the same as all legal practitioners appearing before this court, it can be seen to follow that an icl is perfectly at liberty to, and probably obliged to, argue firmly and fearlessly for what they contend are findings or results consistent with the best interest of the particular children they represent in their particular circumstances - provided always, of course, that each and every such submission is founded upon evidence properly and adequately put before the court. within that rubric, the fact that an icl has a \u201cview\u201d about a particular matter or issue, does not necessarily bring with it a finding of partiality. indeed, it is frequently the duty of an icl to come to a view contrary to that contended for on behalf of a party if, in their proper, considered, professional judgment, the evidence points to such a conclusion. in those circumstances, submissions of the icl, and things said by the icl, will, perhaps almost inevitably, have the appearance of partiality because, frequently enough, the views thus expressed are likely to accord with the position of one of the parents and not the other (although, it needs to be emphasised, that this is, of course, not necessarily so).[48] the independent children\u2019s lawyer is, immediately upon appointment, in an invidious position. he or she is obliged to look beyond the assertions and counter assertions advanced by children\u2019s conflicted parents (and others). in doing so, he or she is presuming, by dint of statutory and other responsibilities, to interfere, to one degree or another, with what can be seen to be a basic right: the right of a parent to parent his or her child in the way they best think fit. yet, when parents, through their conflict or the nature and extent of assertions one makes against the other, abdicate to the court decisions about the best interests of their children, views other than their own, including the views of an icl can, and in the case of the court will, intervene. in that situation, rights and considerations relevant to a determination of best interests enshrined in the act predominate, as do duties owed to the court by an icl. the obligation upon an icl to act objectively and impartially should not be seen as meaning that he or she should act as a benign or ambivalent mouthpiece for competing evidence. frequently, doing so can involve an abdication of their proper professional responsibilities. it would be an intolerable situation if a party could successfully apply to have a child represented removed simply because that party perceived that the representative was not \u2018on side\u2019 or the tide was not running in his or her favour.[50] the critical question in considering an application to remove a child's representative is whether the representative is likely to carry out his or her task properly ... it might well be appropriate to remove a child's representative where the evidence showed that he or she had deliberately misled the court or behaved in unethical or unprofessional ways. it might also be appropriate to remove a child's representative where circumstances arose giving rise to reasonable apprehension that the child representative would not deal with the matter impartially. such circumstances might cast doubt on the ability of the child's representative to \"act in an independent and unfettered way in the best interests of the child. it is appropriate to note in this connection that it is frequently part of the child's representative's role to advance propositions which will be seen by one party as contrary to that party's interests and/or contrary to the child's interests. differences of views are of course inevitable in litigation. while a child's representative should be removed if there are proper reasons for doing so, it would be quite wrong for a court to remove a child's representative merely because a litigant has taken the view that the child's representative is acting contrary to that litigant's position, or (from that litigant's point of view) contrary to the child's best interests. i agree with the child representative's submission that it is important to avoid a situation in which the child representative \"is a captive or the most vocal, litigious or dissatisfied parent or party.[52] ...in relation to an independent children\u2019s lawyer the appearance of bias may be tested by whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children\u2019s lawyer might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the task of independently representing a child.[54] the test that i shall apply is that the father needs to establish that the independent children's lawyer actually lacks impartiality or alternatively, a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children's lawyer lacks impartiality. that test of perceived lack of impartiality however, is to be judged having regard to the role and duties imposed upon the independent children's lawyer by s 68la of the act. that \u201crubric\u201d is discussed by murphy j at [41] \u2013 [61] of knibbs where his honour sets out, amongst other things, the duty of the independent children's lawyer to argue firmly and fearlessly for what the independent children's lawyer contends are findings or results consistent with the best interests of particular children and describes the precarious position an independent children's lawyer is in when fulfilling that role because it may be that the independent children's lawyer is required to challenge the position of one or other of the parents.[56] conclusions associate: dated: 19 may 2023 dated: 19 may 2023 [1] see merritt & bruckner [2023] fedcfamc2f 208.[2] see specific issues report dated 12 april

[mr granden] provided an account of what was happening prior to [x] sustaining the injury. [mr granden] stated he and x had been to [e store] earlier in the day to purchase a [some play equipment]. [mr granden] stated they returned home, and he and [x] were on the back [play area] at his house, and he was erecting [the play equipment]. [mr granden] stated he had his back to [x], and when he turned around, [x] was on the floor, so he did not witness what happened to [x]. police have organised to attend [mr granden]\u2019s home to sight the [premises] and [the play equipment], to confirm [mr granden]\u2019s explanation. \u2018screened out\u2019 serious non-accidental injury. given the nature of the injury, the f hospital conducted an appropriate medical examination of the child, including a skeletal scan, which revealed no other evidence of bony injury consistent with any history of abuse.

(3) the child welfare authorities obtained an expert medical opinion, presumably from a doctor or an orthopaedic surgeon within the hospital \u2013 again, it is somewhat unclear \u2013 as to whether the mechanism of injury described by the father, that is, the child slipping on a wet play area, was plausible and the advice was that was plausible, and indeed, in children that age, a broken bone suffered while running and falling was not uncommon, and further, if there was some degree of twisting in the fall, that could result in a fracture. the upshot of that was that the matter was taken no further. the police interviewed the father and accompanied him to his home and examined the home to see whether what they observed was consistent with the father\u2019s explanation for the child\u2019s injury. it appears, also, that a child welfare worker may have accompanied the police, however that is a little bit unclear. certainly, there was an indication that that was intended.

mobility of parents: obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have been incurred. \u201crelocation cases\u201d are no different from other applications for parenting orders in that respect. like all applications for parenting orders, an application to have the children live with a parent significantly geographically remote from the other parent is to be determined by the children\u2019s best interests. however, the issues in a \u201crelocation case\u201d are, by reason of the proposed geographical separation of parents from their children, often significantly more acute and all the more so in cases of proposed international relocation. and, of course, that same factor will usually render more acute the burden or burdens to be borne by one parent or the other, including restrictions on their freedoms. best interests autism spectrum disorder. persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple contexts as manifested by the following currently or by history (examples are illustrative not exhaustive, see text): deficits in social/emotional reciprocity ranging, for example, from abnormal social approach and failure to normal back-and-forth conversation, to reduced sharing of interests, emotions or affect, to failure to initiate or respond to social interactions. deficits in nonverbal communicative behaviours used for social interaction ranging, for example, from poorly integrated verbal and non-verbal communication, to abnormalities in eye contact and body language, or deficits in understanding and use of gestures, to a total lack of facial expressions and non-verbal communication. deficits in developing, maintaining and understanding relationships ranging, for example, from difficulties adjusting behaviour to suit various social contexts, to difficulties in sharing imaginative play or in making friends, to absence of interest in peers. restrictive repetitive patterns of behaviour, interests or activities as manifested by at least two of the following, currently or by history (examples are illustrative, not exhaustive): 1. stereotyped or repetitive motor movements, use of objects or speech... insistence on sameness, inflexible adherence to routines or ritualised patterns or verbal/non-verbal behaviour, (eg, extreme distress at small changes, difficulties with transitions, rigid thinking patterns, greeting rituals, need to take same route or eat food every day). highly restricted, fixated interests that are abnormal in intensity or focus, (eg, strong attachment to or preoccupation with unusual objects, excessively circumscribed or perseverative interest). hyper- or hyporeactivity to sensory import or unusual interest in sensory aspects of the environment, (eg, apparent indifference to pain/temperature, adverse responses to specific sounds or textures, excessive smelling or touching of objects, visual fascination with lights or movement). symptoms must be present in the early developmental period but may not become fully manifest until social demands exceed limited capacities or may be masked by learned strategies in later life. symptoms cause clinically significant impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of current functioning. these disturbances are not better explained by intellectual disability (intellectual developmental disorder) or global developmental delay. intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder frequently co-occur to make comorbid diagnoses of autism spectrum disorder and intellectual disability, social communication should be below that expected for general developmental level. challenges and support needs mobility although driving her son to daycare is essential, this involves a 30-minute drive twice per day. for [ms halsey], driving leads to burnout and head and shoulder aches. this is due to sensory overload (brightness of daylight), executive functioning challenges (intense focus and shifting attention) and proprioception issues. these challenges cause stress for [ms halsey] and, as a result, she has had a number of minor accidents and penalty notices. communication [ms halsey] struggles with expressive communication in all social settings, particularly in the workplace. she experiences social exhaustion and sensory overload after being around people. as a result of \u201cmasking,\u201d [ms halsey] has been unable to express her own needs in professional and personal relationships. socialising [ms halsey] struggles with making and keeping friends and relationships as well as with managing her emotions. due to financial stress, [ms halsey] does not have a budget for social activities to meet other adults or to do relaxing activities. [ms halsey\u2019s] established family and friends are interstate which has led to isolation. also, as mentioned above, [ms halsey] experiences social exhaustion after being around people in social situations and requires recovery time from socialising. learning [ms halsey] struggles with learning new skills and remembering information in the workplace, particularly when under stress. [ms halsey] is interested to educate herself further about how autistic people learn so that she can pass this information on to her manager. [ms halsey\u2019s] learning struggles are due to challenges with executive functioning. she requires extra time and extra information to break down, understand and retain new information. she also struggles to learn with auditory input only and needs additional inputs, such as visual and tactile, to assist with learning. self-care [ms halsey\u2019s] executive functioning challenges means that she finds shopping, cooking and meal planning challenging and the energy required to do it detracts significantly from her capacity to function in the workplace. [ms halsey] experiences strong sensory overload in supermarkets and often exclusively uses online orders when she can afford it. when overwhelmed and burnt out, she also struggles to meet her own needs and finds it difficult to regulate her emotions. self-management [ms halsey] experiences significant challenges with daily tasks and making decisions. [ms halsey] lives in a house prone to ant infestation so regular cleaning is a necessity and, with small children, this is exhausting for her. the lawn needs regular mowing to prevent weeds overgrowing, which prevents outdoor play with her children. [ms halsey] is frequently overwhelmed by parenting challenges and money stress. [ms halsey] struggles to prevent clutter from accumulating and implementing effective house organisation systems. budgeting is an ongoing challenge and [ms halsey] spends the majority of each week without funds available, relying on the food shopping done earlier in the pay cycle to be sufficient. [ms halsey] prioritises feeding her children and limits her own food intake. [ms halsey] is regularly arranging later payments on bills, cancelling non-essential appointments like the dentist or car repairs. conclusion and recommendations [ms halsey] meets dsm criteria for autism spectrum disorder. it is clear that she has struggled with her daily functioning over many years as a result of undiagnosed and now diagnosed autism. she struggles in all life domains and requires ongoing support. [ms halsey] struggles in the following situations: work - easily experiencing autistic burnout due to variety of factors associated with autism (social exhaustion, social expectation, sensory overload, executive functioning). sensory overload and sensitivities - this is possible in any public setting for [ms halsey] and, as a result, she often avoids going out. emotion regulation - when overwhelmed and burnt out, [ms halsey] struggles to manage anxiety and low mood. social situations - [ms halsey] experiences social anxiety due to a variety of factors associated with autism which leads to social exhaustion and withdrawal which is required for her recovery. [ms halsey] is also socially isolated. daily life tasks and planning: due to stress, burnout, executive functioning issues and anxiety about finances. [ms halsey] would benefit from applying for ndis funding. [ms halsey] would greatly benefit from support for improved functioning through psychology, occupational therapy, dietician, social access programs and home help such as cleaning and yard maintenance. this intensive and substantial support will allow [ms halsey] to continue to work and also manage her competing priorities which are her children, self-care and her home. additionally, support through ndis will allow her to achieve her personal goals in relation to mental health, community and social participation, communication and life administration tasks. please contact me if you have any further questions about this report. dear [ms halsey], as we have discussed the remote working arrangement has not been as successful as we hoped. [professional roles] are fast-paced and challenging, involving close work with small teams in a highly agile environment. it is very difficult to perform these roles from home. we acknowledge your efforts to make the remote working arrangement a success. however, at this stage, we are unable to commit to permanency past the end of your contract in 2023. hopefully she will also begin to make friends and create the lifestyle, including her work/family balance that she seeks. however, this remains unknown. if the mother is unable to create the lifestyle that she desires, and is unsuccessful in developing an appropriate support network, then her mental health may decline, and this could have a detrimental impact on her parenting capacity. there are, however, some concerns relating to the mother\u2019s mental health. she has described a history of depression and anxiety, and a recent episode of acute depression and heightened behaviour. the possibility of bi-polar 2 disorder is being explored. interpose here that she has since been diagnosed with autism, as indicated, as well as adhd.] it is it noted that the mother reported a recent period where she was crying continuously and could not get out of bed. it is likely that this impacted her parenting capacity and her ability to prioritise the children\u2019s needs. however, when mental health is managed well and is appropriately supported, for example, by accessing professional interventions, medication when needed, a strong and well-developed support network, appropriate self-care and healthy lifestyle choices, such as appropriate nutrition and exercise and adequate sleep, mental health can be managed well. well managed mental health problems are not a barrier to adequate and appropriate parenting. it was the view of the report writer that the mother was an intelligent and insightful adult who is child focussed. she has, in the past, identified her mental health needs appropriately and accessed support when needed. she is currently engaging in these supports again, and she is aware of the importance of self-care and strong support. there are enormous advantages to the children in having all of their family members available in the local area, and that the children gained a sense of identity from those relationships which was to their advantage. if the mother was unsuccessful in obtaining appropriately supported employment in the [city bb] region, and she was under financial stress, that this would definitely impact her, as she is vulnerable, and that such stressors may continue and undermine her parenting capacity. that a well-supported and mentally well mother for the children is in their best interests, and that the children\u2019s long-term development and wellbeing is associated with their parents\u2019 wellbeing and security. if the mother is prevented from proceeding with the relocation to [city b], it will cause her a great deal of distress, and she will likely need.....ongoing support in terms of counselling to assist her adjust and accept this restraint. conclusion the reality is that maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents. obligations, both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have been incurred. associate: dated: 19 may 2023 dated: 19 may 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "963.txt", "size": 25160, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 25356, "document_id": "963"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "963_chunk_0"}}

[ms howell] said words to the effect, \u201cwhy aren't you at school [y], you have an excursion and the bus leaves at 8:15\u201d. my car was parked on the western side of [qq street], facing north, out the front of the unit block. [x], [y] and i walked to my car. as i stood at the back of my car checking to make sure it was safe to walk to the driver's door, i heard a car engine revving loudly from my left. i looked and saw [motor vehicle 1]. i looked at the number plate, as is a habit, and saw it was [...], [ms howell\u2019s] car. at the time i saw the number plate it was about 10m away from me and was in the process of passing a white suv which was parked on the opposite side of the road. i looked inside [motor vehicle 1] and saw [mr jj] driving and [ms howell] in the front passenger's seat. the engine was revving high and loud as it travelled faster than other vehicles generally do at time of morning outside [...] my unit. [motor vehicle 1] continued south to [rr street] where i saw it turn left. [x] and [y] were talking on the phone with [ms howell] at the time of my observations. my dash camera captured [motor vehicle 1] on [qq street, suburb c]. (as per the original) late 2022: video call from x february 2023: dr tt\u2019s rooms i am a gp practising in nsw since 2004 and have been a doctor since 1979. [ms howell] was seen with her ex husband [mr howell] and their daughter [x] [in february 2023] at 4pm with a veiw to organising a new psychologist for [x] as the last one would not continue tretment without the father\u2019s involvement. please see letter of 5 dec 2021 from that psychologist who plainly stated in that letter that until the parents put the child\u2019s interests first rather than their own hostilities, nothing would benefit [x] who was caught in the crossfire . and she still is. the father said that the psychologist had cancelled appointments without telling him and that he had taken [x] out of school to attend these appointments. that would have to be checked with the psychologist's office but is a good example of how the communication between all is poor. the result has been that the one independent person that [x] got along with, and who could help her navigate this uncomfortable situation, is no longer available to her to continue and she needs to find a new psychologist and start all over again. this is detrimental to [x\u2019s] well being the aggression of the ex husband [mr howell] was audible even before he entered my consulting room. i heard a raised angry male voice in the corridor and opened the door to check on what was going on as it was a level of disturbance not appropriate to a doctor's waiting room. i had a patient with me at the time but i was concerned that the people outside were safe. things quietened down when i opened the door, and i was able to finish my consultation without disturbance. it became apparent that [mr howell] did not have a good relationship with his daughter during the consultation that followed. she turned away from him whilst sitting on mum\u2019s knee and was reluctant to speak with him in tile room. he had taken her to the police in the past for a bite mark on her arm, alleging it was an assault by her mother. he made the child give a statement to the police. when this went to court the mother said he came to the safe room that [x] was in with a minder ([ms hh]) and tried to get her physically into the court. [ms hh] had to call for the sheriff. [mr howell] has not worked for 6 years now as a result of ptsd sustained in [his previous work]. he currently believes that he has no mental health issues, despite observations during this consultation of him clenching his fists frequently and pointing his finger at me in the air which i had to ask him to stop doing. he seemed to have no insight into his mental health and repeatedly hijacked the consultation to go back to past issues, frequently repeating the same ones. it was with difficulty that i got him back to the issue on the table currently which was organising a new psychologist for [x]. also that he should get his own mental health plan so that his sessions would be covered by his medicare and payments, rather than taking time out of [x\u2019s] own 10 sessions. he had difficulty understanding that concept and was resistant to getting a mental health plan for himself. he also stated that one attendance of his should be sufficient for the benefit of his daughter. his behaviour to his ex wife was threatening - he told her she needed to be told what \u201cacceptable behaviour \u201cwas. he also clearly expects the court to sort these problems out - but he is clearly lacking in insight into how he himself can improve the outcomes, particularly by contributing to the psychologists sessions regarding his daughters anxiety insecurity and low self esteem. i am concerned that he has no current mental health supervision, despite being ptsd medically unfit after his specific work [...]. i am especially concerned that he has bought guns costing $30,000 and they are in [zz facility] and he currently has access to these (info from financial disclosure statement). as a result of this i am going to lodge a risk of severe harm report to child protection regarding [x]. this equally applies to his ex wife and i think should include the other child . that is not to say he shouldn\u2019t have access to [weapons] forever, but in the current circumstances i feel very strongly that he should not have access to any [weapons]. i look forward to hearing your reply to me report. (as per the original) father\u2019s engagement in children\u2019s activities school uniforms y\u2019s learning needs father\u2019s current circumstances ...[mr howell] is not fit to undertake employment [in his previous role]. he is also unable to engage in other forms of employment on the open labour market until the retirement age of 67 years. his significant symptomatologies would preclude him from engaging in productive work. mother\u2019s current circumstances expert evidence report dated 19 january 2023 risk overall, there appears no evidence obtained to recommend for the total exclusion of either parent on matters of contact or parental responsibility. that said, the level of conflict between the parents in this matter remains concerningly high, and the parents\u2019 prospective abilities to be able to bridge that gap in the immediate future is considered low. as such, it is expected that the children will continue to experience conflict between the parents moving forward and this does have capacity to cause either or both children psychological harm. therefore, the recommendations of this report will seek to reduce the opportunity for conflict between the parents as much as possible, while still taking into consideration the children\u2019s additional and ongoing needs. ...in sum, the greatest risk of ongoing harm appears most likely to be resultant of the children\u2019s ongoing exposure to the parents\u2019 high level of conflict. father\u2019s circumstances and mental health howell] was adamant he did not want to see another psychiatrist and was happy with his condition as managed. he denied any current attendance with a psychologist since 2020. a review of [mr howell\u2019s] medical attendance shows irregular consultations with his gp of around 4 over the year from september 2021 to september 2022. [mr howell] appears adamant he does not need further monitoring and his presentation at this assessment does appear more settled than what was described in [dr q\u2019s] report. however, this assessment has also suggested that much of [mr howell\u2019s] hypervigilance and fears of persecution have persisted if not become engrained in his personality. it is recommended that [mr howell] engage in long-term therapy to explore the impact of this on his interactions particularly with his children and [ms howell], although the clinician also acknowledges that [mr howell] does not appear motivated to engage in such treatment. mother\u2019s circumstances and mental health howell] noted that her brother experiences depression and was hospitalised on one occasion for an attempted overdose. she did not identify any other mental health history in her family. [ms howell] denied she had ever experienced significant mental health difficulties. she noted that she and [mr howell] had attempted marriage counselling and she went back to the same counsellor some months later for advice, but otherwise had not attended a psychologist for herself. she also noted returning to [z organisation] 2021 for around five sessions for more assistance with co-parenting issues. capacity howell] does not deny that the children have voiced desires for more social connections. he simply asserted in response that he believes the children \u2018have friends\u2019 and they otherwise spend plenty of time with their cousins and family, and therefore does not need to do anything further to promote this. [mr howell] appears significantly less attuned to the children\u2019s emotional needs nor able to respond to their raised concerns, as was made evident in his transcript of the recorded conversation with [x] where he continued to press her for an explanation at a time where she was apparently struggling to express herself, much less contain her distress in the moment. this is most evident in her repeated requests for him and [y] to simply stop talking. [mr howell] is strongly recommended to take part in a tuning into kids parenting course for emotional attunement, followed by tuning into teens in the coming years as [x] ages. second, it is apparent [mr howell] also had a less than comprehensive understanding of [y\u2019s] educational needs as compared to [ms howell]. the latter is particularly difficult to enforce as he will ultimately put effort into things he evaluates as reasonable concerns. as such, the clinician cannot recommend increasing [y\u2019s] time with [mr howell] without accepting that this facet of [y\u2019s] development may go unaddressed in that household. (as per the original) .] there has been limited reports of concerns for [ms howell\u2019s] capacity to meet the children\u2019s needs. she appears more attuned to the children\u2019s educational and developmental needs inclusive of their need and drive for more social connections. attitude both parents would assert that their own decision-making processes are reflective of a reasonable attitude to their responsibilities as parents. the clinician would review that [mr howell\u2019s] attitudes appear to prioritise personal safety, while it could be compared that [ms howell] might be favouring development and growth. while each parent might subjectively reject the other parent\u2019s perception that they are not equally focusing on development and safety respectively, the parents struggle to reach compromise to achieve balance between their competing priorities. as an example, [x\u2019s] sleepover in [early] 2022 was evident that it required several adults and a police callout to convince [mr howell] to compromise on an arrangement that allowed [x] to sleepover with her friends, and it was still expected that [ms howell] would be there too. \u201cfavouring\u201d of y howell] was asked about allegations that he may favour [y] over [x]. he described them as \u2018rubbish\u2019. [mr howell] was asked whether [x\u2019s] counsellor had reached out for contact. he responded by saying he had contacted her school counsellor. he was asked again specifically about her current counsellor to which he responded that he does not feel he can trust their process. to this, the clinician pointed out that this might be difficult to determine given he has not met with them. [mr howell] declared that he was not able to attend when they first reached out and they have not done so again (though nor had he made any follow-up contact). [mr howell] offered that he was not sure whether [x] was still attending and again reiterated he was not sure the counsellor was independent. comment: the question remains open as to whether this is yet another aspect of [mr howell\u2019s] generalised hypervigilance, which appears is being managed via a somewhat maladaptive strategy of avoidance. (as per the original) howell] stated that she felt that when the children were very young, it became obvious that [mr howell] had always favoured [y] over [x]. she declared that when they first separated, he even proposed splitting the children up, with him taking [y] and [ms howell] to take [x]. she described that he never missed one of [y\u2019s sports] games but until 2021, had never taken [x] to her [sport]. cc] went on to describe that [x] had previously discussed her perception that her father appeared to focus on [y], and favour him over her. [ms cc] detailed [x] described that she wanted her father to \u2018step up\u2019 more, but to the best of her knowledge, had not yet summoned the courage to do so. (as per the original) y\u2019s learning needs howell] was asked about any additional needs the children have. [mr howell] first said none, then with prompting confirmed that [y\u2019s] reading was indeed \u2018behind. no doubt\u2019. he described that [y] was involved in a [literacy] program that involved work at school and some tasks for home that he had to do \u2018from time to time\u2019. ultimately his review of [y\u2019s] educational needs was vague. he said he had discussions with the teacher multiple times but could not recall the last time he had checked in. instead, he declared that [y] has glasses for reading that [ms howell] will not let him take to [mr howell\u2019s] home. (as per the original) howell] declared that she felt it possible that [y] would later require speech pathology to assist with his language development \u2013 she described he had several ear infections as a child, and this had impaired the general development of his phenetic perception. she described that he had previously attended a speech pathologist from 2018-2019. [ms howell] expressed that she was already entirely responsible for his [medical care], social development, and homework and educational development. [ms howell] expressed that she would like [y] to have a full cognitive and learning assessment. was asked about homework. he described that he does a lot more homework at his mum\u2019s. when asked why, he described an online portal where he completes the maths homework, but he only has the code at mums. the clinician enquired as to whether that code is something that could easily be shared between parents so he could complete the work in both environments, to which [y] shrugged. [y] confirmed he reads in both houses. was asked about homework. she said she usually does a little bit of homework in both homes, saying she does spelling first and maths later. [x] did not distinguish between doing certain homework in different homes. whether due to his age, his potentially \u2018favoured\u2019 position with his father, or the fact he has so far experienced less direct involvement in conflict compared to [x] (or all of the above), [y\u2019s] currently emotional wellbeing appears much less effected. he did not demonstrate overtly anxious features or elevated symptoms of depression. however, it was clear the greater concerns relate to [y\u2019s] education and development as his delay in reading has been identified. [ms howell] is concerned that [y] requires more consistent engagement with his plan for bridging that delay, and [y] too reported a difference in the level and type of homework he does between his two homes. the subpoenaed material from [y\u2019s] school indicated [y\u2019s] reading difficulties have been identified for well over two years. the material outlines several meetings with parents and plans for addressing his reading gap at home. the clinician thus agrees that [mr howell\u2019s] apparent minimal level of concern about [y\u2019s] reading plan is troubling. x\u2019s mental health was asked about the incident in [mid-2022] and her interview with police in [mid\u20112022]. the clinician asked her to narrate what happened from the point of coming into contact with the police. [x] immediately shut down. she shook her head and hid her head in her hands and expressed that she did not want to talk about it. [x] said that she knew she had to talk to someone again (apparently referencing her need to appear in court [...]) and said she did not like it. a common strategy for identifying a child\u2019s goals is to ask what they might do with three wishes. [x] said she only wished that \u2018the thing\u2019 had not happened. based on the context of the discussion this was noted to specifically reference the bite from her mother. still, it was evident that the involvement of the police and now ongoing requirement to address this in court again is a source of considerable distress to [x]. y\u2019s mental health two measures were administered to [y] as assessments of his current emotional wellbeing. his responding indicated a low probability that he is experiencing symptoms associated with an anxiety disorder and provided self-descriptors that indicated he had a secure self-confidence, and no indication of symptoms of dysphoria or depression. children\u2019s social development was asked about her time with her father. [x] stated that when she is with her dad she asks if she can have sleepovers, but he says that she is too young. at this point [x] was observed to demonstrate regressive behaviours, curling her posture in, and chewing on her sleeve. [x] declared that her \u2018dad doesn\u2019t let me walk with my friends\u2019. when asked more [x] responded with \u2018i don\u2019t know\u2019. the most the clinician could ascertain was that this was a point of personal distress for [x], but (based on observation only), she evidenced a weariness associated with potentially getting into trouble if she said much more. (as per the original) children\u2019s views opted not to put forward a clear preference at this time, but that appeared to be less driven by uncertainty or confusion about what she wanted, and more motivated about not being drawn even further into this conflict. given her being directly involved in a local court proceeding against her mother, it would also be an inopportune time to ascertain her wishes as she appeared openly resistant to her father and could potentially be motivated to try and protect her mother. [y] opted for no change, as might be expected given his reduced experience of conflict and otherwise young age, where change presents as a potentially increase in conflict. as such, the clinician can only suggest the court place minimal weight on the children\u2019s views as expressed here, and given [x] already fears the impact her previous disclosures may have on her family ongoing, the clinician does not suggest any further weight or responsibility is placed upon her regarding this. expert\u2019s oral evidence both children are expending considerable amounts of energy to minimise

reasons for judgment judge brown: introduction i have been unable to seek work outside of the home due the unpredictable needs of the children, their current mental health struggles, and [x\u2019s] ongoing recovery from [her mental illness] which has been slow and exacerbated by delays in this matter. when the needs of the children permit, i hope to complete my [...] studies and find part-time employment.[10] i have always left the financial records and banking to my wife. since our separation, i have had the opportunity to read some of our bank accounts and mortgage loan statements. i have a serious concern that there are a number of transactions and money transfers which i did not know about and i now want the opportunity to check all our records.[14] orders sought by the parties the conduct of the proceedings the applicant has made repeated demands that i provide him with 20 years of bank statements and threatens that he will have a full forensic investigation of our accounts over this period. he has made vague and unspecified allegations that he now mistrusts my management of our finances in the marriage. i have provided both the applicant and his solicitor large quantities of documents and historical financial paperwork but he still continues to demand more. i received a further request from the applicant\u2019s solicitor on 10 december 2020 for additional historical documents (including those the applicant himself has access to) and further aggressive texts from the applicant.[15] i have been undertaking a great deal of research into various transactions that occurred during our marriage, in order to endeavour to trace various amounts of money, in circumstances where i believe that my wife, who managed all our finances during our marriage, has removed significant funds from our joint enterprise and has not accounted for those funds. i believe that obtaining the documents that i require from [v bank] will enable me to prove that funds provided by that loan were not applied for the purchase of a motor vehicle, as was alleged at the time, and that those funds have been applied elsewhere. i have engaged [mr w], a chartered accountant, to assist me with enquiries.[17] i have formed the view that the respondent has, over a long period of time, removed very substantial sums of money for our various accounts, and i believe that she has not fully disclosed funds which she has hidden from me.[18] the source of this belief was said to be based on his examination of ms roswell\u2019s financial disclosure in the case. for financial years ended 30 june 2002 to 30 june 2008 inclusive, there is a shortfall in the reported turnover of the company in each said financial year by approximately $800,000.00 totalling $5,600.00 for the said financial years.[19] in this context, he asserts that ms roswell appears to have cash loaded credit cards in her name. upon noting the parties have reached and in-principle agreement with the assistance of [the] judicial registrar [...] and require further time to finalise a consent minute of order and to allow procedural fairness to be afforded the court orders that: further consideration of the matter is adjourned to 18 august 2022 at 2.15pm for consideration of consent orders to be made finalising the matter noting the proceedings will be conducted face to face at court. ms roswell relied only on the affidavit material, which she had personally deposed and filed. the evidence although the visa was a personal account, as it was also used for company expenses, i accounted for all transactions made on it in the company books, with those credits and debits of a personal nature for the husband, myself, and the children, such as food, education costs and medical expenses, recorded against director's loan account [...00] in myob. lump sum payments paying down the visa account from our personal accounts were recorded as a credit on the [...00] account. company expenses included fuel, insurances, and licensing to name a few, in addition to those trade supplier payments, such as [u company], were allocated to their relevant expense accounts. transactions for the director's loan [...00] account for the period 1/7/2008 to 30/6/2020 were disclosed on 2 march 2021for the husband's forensic accountant. [cc company] paid us via cheque on a weekly basis, whereas company suppliers, such as [u company], provided payment terms to us of 30 days after the end of month. as funds received from [cc company] were not required until end of month to pay accounts, in the interim, and to maximise the benefit of being in receipt of said funds, i would transfer lump sums out of the [n pty ltd] company account, that weren't required at the time, into the [town d] offset account, to reduce interest accruing on that loan for benefit of the parties. the husband was aware of this. i would then transfer into either the company account or visa credit card account, as required to pay bill. whilst i acknowledge that i moved funds between accounts, neither the husband, nor his forensic accountant [mr w] has provided any evidence of wrongdoing.[23] the legal principles applicable given the evaluation of contribution based entitlements inevitably moves from qualitative evaluation of contributions to a quantitative reflection of such evaluation, there will inevitably be a \u201cleap\u201d from words to figures. that is the nature of the exercise of discretion, whether it be in the assessment of contributions in the matrimonial cause, assessment of damages in a personal injuries case, or determination of compensation in a land resumption case... the expression \u2018just and equitable\u2019 is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.[36] as a result of those matters, the court\u2019s approach to s 79/s90sm may be less compartmentalised than what a strict or unthinking adherence to four (or three) \u201csteps\u201d might otherwise reveal. the task is essentially holistic, is it just and equitable in the particular circumstances of the particular relationship or marriage under consideration to make an order and, if so, its terms must similarly meet that criteria. of course, holistic though the approach is, it must be referenced to what the act requires and care must be taken to ensure that the court\u2019s reasons make that clear.[37] where the court has determined that it is just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79(2) or s 90sm(3) and there is clear evidence that one party has engaged in conduct and, but for that conduct, the legal and equitable interests of a party or the parties (or the value of those interests) would have be significantly greater, justice and equity may require recognition of the unfairness inherent in those circumstances in the terms of the orders to be made. how might that be recognised? first, consistent with existing authority, it can be recognised pursuant to s 75(2)(o) (cf s 90sf(3)(r)). secondly, it might be contended that it might be recognised within the assessment of contributions. this court has long eschewed the notion of \u201cnegative contributions\u201d. nevertheless, it might be argued that the \u201cnon-dissipating party\u201d can be seen to have made a disproportionally greater indirect contribution to the existing legal and equitable interests (for example to their preservation) if it is established that, but for the other party\u2019s unilateral dissipation, those existing legal and equitable interests would have been greater or had a greater value. the assessment of the circumstance under discussion is, ultimately, a matter of discretion. equally, however, authority dictates that it will be \u201cthe exception rather than the rule\u201d that a direct dollar adjustment equivalent to the amount of the alleged dissipation of the pool is made to the otherwise entitlement of a party. it may be that aspects of the erstwhile treatment of legal fees pre-stanford will require further consideration in an appropriate case. importantly, of course, as has been emphasised in many authorities including those cited above, not every dissipation by a party can be seen to involve an affront to justice and equity, again the circumstances of the individual relationship must be assessed. (citations removed)[45] two fundamental premises emerge from omacini and the authorities preceding it. first, \u2018adding back\u2019 is a discretionary exercise. when the discretion is exercised in favour of adding back, it reflects a decision that, exceptionally, in the particular circumstances of a case, justice and equity requires it. the second premise is its corollary: in cases that are not \u2018exceptional\u2019 justice and equity can be achieved, not by adding back, but by the exercise of a different discretion \u2013 usually by taking up the same as a relevant s 75(2) factor. indeed, it has been said that the latter is \u2018a course which is, perhaps, technically more correct\u2019 than adding back to the list of existing interests in property. this decision appears to confirm the principle that where the payment of legal costs can be regarded as a premature distribution of funds (in which both parties have an interest), it is appropriate to add back those costs as a notional asset. it also confirms the principle that where funds have been borrowed to pay legal fees, and such liability is still outstanding, neither the payment of the fees nor the liability should be taken into account. the decision also supports the proposition that where it is determined that a payment of legal fees should be taken into account as a notional asset, any outstanding liability in respect of those fees should also be taken into account. in summary, we consider that the above mentioned decisions of the full court establish that, while the treatment of funds used to pay legal costs remains ultimately a matter for the discretion of the trial judge, in determining how to exercise that discretion, regard should be had to the source of the funds. if the funds used existed at separation, and are such that both parties can be seen as having an interest in them (on account, for example, of contributions), then such funds should be added back as a notional asset of the party, who has had the benefit of them. if funds used to pay legal fees have been generated by a party post-separation from his or her own endeavours or received in his or her own right (for example, by way of gift or inheritance), they would generally not be added back as a notional asset, nor would any borrowing undertaken by a party post-separation to pay legal fees be taken into account as a liability in the calculation of the net property of the parties. funds generated from assets or businesses to which the other party had made a significant contribution or has an actual legal entitlement may need to be looked at differently from other post-separation income or acquisitions.[49] it is well settled that save in exceptional circumstances a trial judge should deal with the property as at the date of the hearing and make adjustments taking into account the various matters set out under s.79. however, the particular justice of the case may make it appropriate to notionally add back assets which have been demonstrated to have been dissipated either during the marriage or post-separation. normally it is necessary to demonstrate an appropriate basis for doing so, for example by wastage such as gambling or extravagant living. additionally, because of the requirement for each party to bear their own costs, it is generally appropriate to add back to the pool of assets notionally any legal costs that have been spent on the litigation and to deal with the costs as a separate issue at the end of the litigation. there seems to be no appropriate basis for notionally adding back moneys that existed at separation but which have been subsequently spent on meeting reasonably incurred necessary living expenses. neither the family law act nor the case law require that parties go into a state of suspended economic animation once their marriage breaks down pending the resolution of their financial arrangements. parties are entitled to continue to provide for their own support. whether any expenditure so incurred is reasonable or extravagant is a matter that can be determined by the trial judge.[50] issues value of former family home we have assessed the value of the shedding to be $80,000 and the pool to be $30,000 which includes pool fencing and perimeter paving. the total value not included in this assessment is $110,000 due to permits not being obtained. value of holiday home at town d the husband was involved in the parties gaining council approval for the [...] shed, attached [structure], and room addition, (which originally received approval as [an outdoor structure], and was later enclosed via the introduction of materials to form two walls to create a room referred to as the 'dwelling addition' in the report, for which the underlying council approved [outdoor] structure was not altered to accommodate said walls)... the shed and [attached structure] have full council approval, adding $50,000 to the valuation, and i seek only $5,000 of the possible $55,000 for the dwelling addition for the approved [outdoor structure], giving a total value of $445,000 i seek be attributed to the [town d] property in the asset pool.[55] ms roswell has supplied what she asserts are the relevant council approvals for these structures.[56] this evidence is the basis for her claim that the town d property should be included in the asset pool at a value of $445,000.00. monies withdrawn from the line of credit/legal fees and issues to do with the family trust other contributions other liabilities hat emerges from the authorities is that while there might be a \u201crule\u201d the application of which is appropriate in the vast majority of cases, the manner in which a particular liability should be treated is, ultimately, dependent upon the nature of the liability, the circumstances surrounding the liability and the dictates of justice and equity shaped by each. the usual practice or \u201crule\u201d sits comfortably and conformably within that rubric \u2013 in many cases, perhaps almost all, liabilities will be deducted from the \u201cgross\u201d value of the property because it will be clear (and even if not expressly stated, determined) that the justice and equity of the case demands that the liabilities should be met by the parties in the proportions in which the court determines the property is to be divided. legal costs the court should not depart lightly from the ordinary rules relating to costs between party and party and the circumstances justifying the departure should be of an exceptional kind.[66] step one \u2013 the pool of assets and liabilities assets value ($) former family home at suburb h 910,000.00 town d property 445,000.00 proceeds of sale of k street, suburb l

the parties, the needs of the children, whether the assessment is being paid regularly, and whether it is likely that it will continue to be paid at a regular and adequate rate in the future. summary

of the parties contributions consideration of the contributions section 75(2) factors the repeated non-compliance of the wife has caused the husband to incur costs he might not ordinarily have incurred had there been compliance. that includes not just the costs of the final hearing but also the costs incurred in repeated attendances before the court. those costs, given the costs notice that i have seen, would seem to total at least $26,000, and (b) the wife\u2019s non-disclosure of her financial position is a matter of concern. she will walk away under the order that is proposed by the husband with the continued ownership of the d pty ltd company, whatever assets it may hold, and whatever intellectual property of c pty ltd that may be there. the wife\u2019s non-disclosure of her financial position is a matter of concern. she will walk away under the order that is proposed by the husband with the continued ownership of the d pty ltd company, whatever assets it may hold, and whatever intellectual property of c pty ltd that may be there. the funds held by the victorian supreme court to be split equally between the parties with the debt to b accountants to be paid, effectively, from the wife\u2019s share. i agree that the wife is responsible for paying b accountants. the husband ceased to have any ownership, interest or active role in c pty ltd well before liquidators were appointed. in short, the appointment of liquidators, and the events leading to it occurred on the watch of the wife. in summary, this will result in the funds from the victorian supreme court being dispersed in the following ways. approximately $40,000 to b accountants, approximately $160,000 to the husband and approximately $120,000 to the wife. (b) the parties to otherwise retain the assets in their possession. this results in the husband retaining a motor vehicle 1 valued at $5,000, a motor vehicle 2 valued at $2,000, a motor vehicle 3 valued at $12,000, a motor vehicle 4 valued at $10,000 and a recreational vehicle valued at $12,000, as well as other assets of nominal value. the wife would retain a motor vehicle 5 valued at $11,000, as well as other assets of nominal value. the parties to otherwise retain the assets in their possession. this results in the husband retaining a motor vehicle 1 valued at $5,000, a motor vehicle 2 valued at $2,000, a motor vehicle 3 valued at $12,000, a motor vehicle 4 valued at $10,000 and a recreational vehicle valued at $12,000, as well as other assets of nominal value. the wife would retain a motor vehicle 5 valued at $11,000, as well as other assets of nominal value. associate: dated: 23 june 2023 dated: 23 june 2023 [1] settled reasons were prepared upon the request of the respondent wife which was received on 13 june 2023.", "metadata": {"filename": "967.txt", "size": 14193, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 14310, "document_id": "967"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "967_chunk_0"}}

heightened state of arousal resulting in refusal and crying. despite improvements, [x] can be impulsive and seeks control of activities, reducing his ability to concentrate and attend to the task at hand. he requires prompting to wait for activities to be explained before beginning. presents with a number of complex comorbid conditions and has experienced and continues to experience a number of possibly traumatic family events that may be impacting on his behaviour. these factors should be taken into consideration when developing therapy and learning plans to support [x]\u2019s ongoing

informed me that [mr kiesel] used to hit her when she was in his care, leaving marks. i\u2019m concerned this may have happened to [y], given his strong desire not to go anywhere near [mr kiesel]. [y] won\u2019t even make eye contact with [mr kiesel] anymore. i\u2019m aware that [u] sees a therapist due to issues with [mr kiesel]. [mr kiesel] told [u] if she wanted to see the boys, it had to be through him to try and manipulate her into seeing him. when [mr kiesel] became aware i had taken the boys to [ms v]\u2019s \u2013 s mother] ...to spend time with [u], [mr kiesel] became extremely aggressive and hostile towards [u], which resulted in a massive meltdown from [u].

father\u2019s proposed minute of order (exhibit ten). 10 the only witnesses called were the parties and the paternal grandparents. 11 dr d (\u201csingle expert\u201d) gave evidence and was cross-examined. 12 the father gave direct and honest answers. i find him to be a credible witness. 13 the mother was a friendly witness who answered the questions asked of her. her evidence needs to be understood in the context of her medical condition. she has been diagnosed with, and receives treatment for, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cadhd\u201d) and post traumatic stress disorder (\u201cptsd\u201d). 14 the mother gave evidence that she is an \u201cundiagnosed autistic\u201d. she referred to this when she was shown evidence which suggested that she had provided an inaccurate answer. sometimes she was unsure about the order of past events and asked to be referred to affidavit material because she needed \u201cprompts to jog memories and/or access memories\u201d. 15 both paternal grandparents said that they did not trust the mother because she occasionally spoke untruths, or at least gave a version of events that did not reflect their reality. this was tested under cross-examination. for example it was put to the mother that changeovers did not present any difficulties for x. the mother challenged this, saying that for the majority of changeovers she has had to coax x to leave her. she said: he clings to me, says he does not want to go, i have had to cuddle him, soothe him, there is a lot of disruptiveness ...on some occasions i have had to forcibly get him in the car, he was grabbing my clothes, arms, and it was one of the most distressing things that i have ever had to do. 16 counsel for the father pointed out that this issue had not been raised in her affidavit or the single expert report. the mother alleged that she had told her lawyers and the single expert but they chose not to refer to the issue. 17 x has behavioural difficulties and i accept that on some occasions his behaviour might be challenging. however, i cannot accept difficulties at changeover to be a regular occurrence. i am not suggesting that the mother deliberately mislead the court. rather, this demonstrates an occasion where the mother\u2019s experience may not have accorded with the reality of other witnesses. therefore, i have treated the mother\u2019s version of certain events with caution, and on some matters i will prefer the evidence of other witnesses. 18 the paternal grandmother gave evidence in an honest and frank manner. she admitted that she could not trust the mother. while she is clearly aligned with the father\u2019s case, it is clear that she loves x very much, supports him enormously, and is an important person in his life. i found her to be a truthful witness. 19 the paternal grandfather gave his evidence in a clear and forthright manner. while he is clearly aligned to the father\u2019s case, there is no doubt that he works hard to get the best outcomes for his family, and will continue to play an active and hands on role in supporting the father and x. he is the patriarch of the family, and the father and mother had previously turned to him for support. he was observed to be a man of honesty, intelligence and integrity. however, it is possible that the mother finds him, and her dealings with him, to be intimidating. nonetheless i found him to be a credible witness. 20 the single expert was a credible witness who provided great insight into the family dynamics and x\u2019s needs. i accept the evidence she gave. relevant facts 21 the mother is ms sackville who was born in 1985 and is aged 35 years old. the mother was born in the united states of america (\u201cusa\u201d). 22 the father is

is important to capture information about x who is the subject of these proceedings. 36 x is five years old. 37 on 13 december 2017 the parents received a report that x had global development delay (\u201cgdd\u201d). 38 on 29 june 2018 dr j provided a report noting x to have both gdd, traits of autism, and adhd. the report further noted that x has a rare medical condition of which the long term impacts are unknown. 39 on 31 may 2019 x\u2019s ndis funding was approved. 40 on 7 april 2021 a report on x\u2019s special needs was prepared by the child development unit of the children\u2019s hospital in suburb k. it diagnosed x with: (a) diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders (dsm 5) autism spectrum disorder (\u201casd\u201d) requiring very substantial support (level 3 for

with an amazing, vibrant and affectionate personality. 42 the father describes x as a happy, affectionate, energetic and playful child. 43 the single expert did not interview x due to his young age and language difficulties. she did however observe him with the parties. the single expert made the following observations as to x: (a) x attempted to make conversation in his interactions with his father, (b) x was quite loud and noisy in his play, and at times his laughing response was exaggerated, (c) x enjoyed playing with a truck and beating a drum in the play room, and (d) x was quite

years and 4 months) presented as a busy and active child...x was observed to be restless and disruptive with a number of behaviours which would suggest developmental delays. at the time of the interviews x was not yet toilet trained.[3] 45 the single expert concluded the single expert report with the following recommendations: (a) that the parties have equal shared parental responsibility. if they cannot achieve this on their own, they might benefit from engaging with a therapist preferably who specialises in family law with the view of working on issues such as sharing parental responsibility, reflecting on their parenting behaviour, testing their views on each other and exploring avenues for addressing tensions in their parenting relationship. (b) that x lives with his mother. (c) that x spend five days per fortnight with his father. it is recommended that school holidays and special occasions be shared equally between the parties.

act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d). 47 pursuant to s 60ca of the act the court must consider what is in the best interests of the child when making a parenting order. in hardie v capris [2010] famca 1046 at [48] murphy j succinctly clarified: \u201cbest interests\u201d is not the application of a theoretical construct but, rather, the practical application of a number of considerations relevant to the individual needs, desires, health and aspirations of the particular child or children of this particular parenting relationship. 48 as discussed by the full court in moose & moose [2008] famcafc 108 at [66], the role of the judicial officer in making orders which are in the best interests of the child is to determine the best interest having regard to \u201cthe matters set out in section 60cc(2) and (3) guided in consideration of the provisions by the objects set out in section 60b(1) and the principles underpinning it contained in section 60b(2)\u201d. 49 in the leading authority of mazorski & albright [2007] famca 520 at [3] (\u201cmazorski & albright\u201d), justice brown refers to the primary considerations for determining the child\u2019s best interests, as set out in s 60cc(2) of the act, as the \u201ctwin pillars\u201d of the act outlining that: the first pillar is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. 50 the act indicates that these considerations are to be considered as having particular importance. they are described as the primary considerations. as stated in s 60b, the best interests of the child are met by ensuring they have the benefit of both their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives to the maximum extent, consistent with their best interests, and protecting them from physical or psychological harm, and from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. 51 the court must balance the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with the father with the primary consideration of protecting him from physical or psychological harm, from being subjected or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. fortunately for x, no significant risk issues were raised at the final hearing. 52 the concept of \u201ca meaningful relationship\u201d has been discussed in many authorities, most significantly in the decision of justice brown in mazorski & albright. those authorities establish that \u201ca meaningful relationship\u201d is a qualitative concept. the relationship is not measured simply by the amount of time the child is spending with each parent, but the quality of the relationship that exists between the child and parent. 53 there are 13 additional considerations for determining what is in a child\u2019s best interest, which are set out in s 60cc(3). i will address those which are relevant later in this judgment. 54 if the child is subject to an equal shared parental responsibility order, the amount of time to be spent by the non-resident parent, if reasonably practical, must be considered. where there is a dispute between equal time and substantial and significant time, the court is required to consider whether an order for equal time or substantial and significant time is in the best interests of the child and is reasonably practicable.[4] 55 for a parenting order to involve a child spending substantial and significant time with a parent, s 65daa(3) requires that it must at least provide for the children to spend time with the parent both on days falling on weekends and holidays, and on days falling outside those times. the order must also allow the parent to be involved in the children\u2019s daily routine, on occasions and events that are of particular significance to the children, and for the children to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent. 56 there is a distinct pathway which applies to parenting matters where an equal shared parental responsibility order is made, and this pathway will be followed.[5] the evidence on the section 60cc considerations 57 there is no doubt that both parents enjoy a meaningful relationship with x and will continue to do so. x will benefit from the continuation of this. 58 the single expert also confirmed that x will benefit from the visible and active presence of his parents in his life.[6] 59 i note that the mother made allegations of sexual violence against the father at the date of separation. these allegations were denied by the father, there are no family violence orders, and neither party contended that x is at risk of harm in the care of either parent. 60 the mother also alleged in her affidavit some past concerns about the father\u2019s capacity to care for himself and x when he was living alone. these concerns about neglect appeared to arise in the context of a mental health episode experienced by the father post separation. the mother did not press this issue as a current risk. 61 the mother was open and honest about her mental health issues. she was diagnosed with adhd in 1999 and has been under the consistent treatment of medical practitioners to manage her condition since. in 2018 she was also diagnosed with ptsd and sees a psychiatrist every six months for a review. there was no suggestion that the mother\u2019s health posed any risk to x, unless of course she fails to attend on her treating practitioners or stops following their recommendations. 62 this is not a case where either party asserts that x is at risk of harm in the care of either party, nor that there is a need to protect x from physical or psychological harm that he might be exposed to in either household. 63 section 60cc(3) of the act sets out additional consideration for determining what is in a child\u2019s best interest, and reference is now made to those relevant to these proceedings. 64 the mother has been the primary caregiver for x throughout his life. she has had a significant role in the care of x to date. she gave sensitive evidence about x\u2019s special needs and how she ensures they are met. 65 the father has also been actively engaged in x\u2019s life and it is clear that he enjoys a positive relationship with x. this was supported by the single expert\u2019s observations.[7] 66 the paternal grandparents have enjoyed a close and loving relationship with x since he was born. x has, and continues to spend significant time with them. they provide excellent support to the father in caring for x. 67 both parties have had an active involvement in making decisions about the major long-term issues regarding x. the mother does not work and has always been the primary carer for x. she has consistently been involved in all decisions concerning his long-term welfare and development. 68 the father works full time. in his previous role he was subject to restrictions about the use of his telephone during business hours. as a result, he says he asked his parents to assist from time to time by making phone calls or appointments on his behalf for x. at the time of the hearing he had commenced a new position of employment and was confident that he would not be so reliant on his parents for this in the future. 69 the parents\u2019 ability to communicate with each other regarding major long-term decisions is an issue of contention. the father alleges that the mother has made unilateral decisions regarding x. one such issue arose during the hearing. the parties had given evidence that x was being assessed and considered for admission to the special needs class for kindergarten aged students at e public school commencing in 2022. the father, when he gave evidence, indicated that he had missed a call from the department of education that day, and suspected that they were ringing to confirm that a place had been made available for x. 70 when the mother gave evidence the following day she confirmed that not only was x offered a place but that she had accepted it. paperwork had been sent to the mother the day before with instructions that she should complete and return it as soon as possible. the support class placement documentation was sent at 10:33am, and the mother returned the paperwork to the school one hour later. 71 while the father was copied into her response, the mother acknowledged that she had not communicated with him prior to accepting the offer. there was no suggestion that in doing so, the mother took steps that where inconsistent or contrary to the father\u2019s wishes. rather the incident highlighted the father\u2019s assertion that at times the mother can act compulsively, and in doing so fails to allow him to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues for x. 72 the father also expressed concern that the mother has historically been slow in engaging x with services. 73 the father has paid, and continues to pay child support in accordance with a child support assessment. he currently pays the mother $36 per fortnight. 74 there was also an issue of contention as to the payment of services not covered by ndis payments. the paternal grandparents allege that they paid for fitkidz before it was covered by ndis. they indicate that they will continue to provide a financial safety net for x\u2019s treatments and therapies should this be necessary. there is no reason to question their ongoing commitment to supporting x financially or otherwise. 75 the mother will continue to be x\u2019s primary carer and in all likelihood, his primary attachment figure. a significant issue in this case is the extent to which extended time with the father is in x\u2019s best interests. the father seeks to increase his time with x to a six day block. he proposes that he continue to split this block over a two week period until the commencement of term three in 2022. the mother argues that a five day block period is in x\u2019s best interests. she would like to move to one five day block in every fortnight as soon as possible. 76 there is a dispute between the parties as to x\u2019s adjustment between the two households. the mother gives evidence that more frequent moves between households is unsettling and disruptive for x. she gave evidence that on his return from the father\u2019s household x is often tired, unsettled and can display difficult behaviours. the father and the paternal grandparents did not report a similar experience. 77 the single expert found that for it to work well for x, a climate of consistency and understanding of his needs is required. at the time of writing the single expert report, she found that the parties were not entirely at that point. she recommended that x live with his mother, and spend substantial time with his father until the parties could demonstrate that they can implement mature and child focussed co-parenting arrangements.[8] 78 the single expert observed that for pre-school children, spending time weekly with each parent is developmentally important. however moving between houses requires a readjustment, and it is destabilising for a child to leave a home every week and then come back for a day. she felt a 5 day block is a natural progression for x because there was a benefit of fewer transitions. she observed that this was important for children on the autism spectrum because routine is important. 79 perhaps then the largest contention on the likely impact of changes in x\u2019s circumstances arise from the single expert\u2019s evidence on how best to phase in changes for x. 80 she recommended that the changes should not coincide with x\u2019s school commencement saying \u201cany changes need to be metered out rather than an avalanche of change as that could be confusing and bamboozling for him\u201d. she cautioned that any change needed to be introduced sensitively and carefully. 81 she further recommended a transition to five nights with the father over a two week period, then moving to five nights in one block. 82 the parents live about 15 kilometres (a 20 minute drive) from each other. they have agreed that changeovers will ultimately take place before or after school. because the mother does not work, the father agrees to collect and return x to her home when he is not attending school. 83 there appears to be no practical difficulty or expense for x in spending time with the father. 84 it is not unusual for a court to be asked to make communication orders, particularly for video communication between a parent and child at set times. the parties gave evidence on this issue. x exhibits behavioural difficulties. he still has difficulty with verbal communications, speaking only a few words. the mother expressed concern about committing to an order that requires x to have communication with his father at a set time for these reasons. 85 the mother does not work and is available to care for x on a full time basis. she gave very thorough evidence about the steps she has taken since x\u2019s birth to meet his physical, emotional and intellectual needs. 86 the father raised two concerns about the mother\u2019s capacity to provide for x\u2019s needs. he says that she doesn\u2019t drive, and because she is reliant on public transport can be prone to running late or not meeting appointments made for x. he is also worried about the impact this might have in the future when for example, x is enrolled in organised sport and needs to be driven to sporting fields. 87 the mother did not accept that this has been a problem to date or that it will be an issue into the future. initially the father was pressing for x to be in his care each friday night/saturday. when this was explored he said he was hoping that it would allow him to assist with transportation, and to attend x\u2019s sports and extracurricular activities. the mother reasonably requested she also have the opportunity to spend a weekend with x but expressed no hesitation in the father attending events or assisting with transportation. 88 the father\u2019s second concern arises from what he alleges is a pattern in the mother\u2019s diligence in taking x to his appointments. he alleged that the mother had missed facilitating 11 out of 27 speech therapy appointments, delayed making x\u2019s ndis application in 2018 and cancelled paediatric appointments which may have led to a delay in x getting access to appropriate therapies. 89 the single expert emphasised the need for x to receive as much early intervention as possible, and for the parents to work together to ensure that he does receive the support he needs. she was of the view that the parents had some work to do before they were co-parenting effectively and recommended that they participate in family therapy to assist them in overcoming their mutual lack of trust. 90 the father argued that if he had more time with x he would take more responsibility for ensuring x\u2019s attendance at appointments. he has not been able to make this commitment in the past due to his work commitments which required him to be working on a full-time basis during set day time hours, without access to a mobile telephone. as a result he relied upon his parents to assist him with his parenting responsibilities. at the time of the hearing the father had commenced a new job where he is required to answer help-desk calls from home, five days each week, 8.5 hours each day. however, he says that he will have more availability and potentially flexibility to assist in x\u2019s care in the future. 91 the paternal grandparents have been of great assistance to the father. they facilitated x\u2019s attendance at fitkidz, a homebased therapy scheduled for days when he was in the father\u2019s care. the paternal grandfather has a background as a \u201csenior executive\u201d and believed that he could continue to assist the parties in accessing services for x. in the past he has, with the father\u2019s authority, made enquiries and appointments on the father\u2019s behalf. 92 while the paternal grandparents have the capacity to meet the emotional and intellectual needs of x, and seek to continue to play an active role, there was little trust between them and the mother. their involvement has led to difficulties as observed by the single expert who said that while the grandparents were \u201ccoming from a concerned, well intentioned and caring space...it is always problematic when grandparents are seen to be overriding the role of parents\u201d.[9] she concluded that the impact of this on the mother would most likely have been to have \u201craised her defensiveness and left her feeling marginalised and disempowered\u201d.[10] 93 the single expert was of the view that moving forward the parties needed to find a way to respect each other and improve their communication. she outlined that: when a child has special needs, the efficacy of the child transitioning between two households is highly reliant on the parents being collaborative rather than competitive and operating from the same information, consistent intervention and similar behaviour management strategies. this cannot happen in a vacuum of the parties working together and both being involved in sessions with treating professionals or at the very least receiving summaries of those sessions. therapy intervention which involves only one parent making the decisions or the parties not being able to agree on treating therapists and therefore suggesting multiple therapists is therefore not recommended. there is strong risk if this occurs that x will quickly come to understand that there is no consistency between the two homes and that will leave him open to behaving manipulatively and playing one parent against the other. it is also likely to leave the parties persisting with disparate perceptions of x\u2019s developmental delay and therefore operating from different baselines in their expectations of his abilities which increases the conflict between them.[11] 94 the mother is an american citizen and seeks the inclusion of some culturally important days with x such as thanksgiving and halloween. she would also like to obtain united states citizenship and an american passport for x. 95 the mother has committed herself to taking care of x on a full-time basis and ensuring that his medical needs are met. the father has also been involved in x\u2019s life as much as he can, given his work commitments. 96 the mother also showed a responsible attitude to parenthood and encouraging the father\u2019s relationship with x. for example under cross-examination she conceded that x tells her sometimes that he misses his dad. she said she reassures him that his dad loves him and he will see him soon. she also was open to introducing x to video communications with the father when he is not in the father\u2019s care. 97 it was the court\u2019s observation that the parties\u2019 recent written communications were friendly, informative and generally appropriate. under cross-examination their approach and attitude to each other was displayed and observed to be respectful and appropriate. however issues for these parents seem to arise when they fail to consult or involve each other on an issue. 98 the schooling enrolment issue that arose during the hearing was an example of a situation where their parental communication completely failed. the parents have struggled with their communications in the past and this has led to mistrust. family therapy was ordered but issue arose with the location of the therapist. as the single expert recommended, they need to engage in family therapy to improve their communication and build up trust. parental responsibility 99 pursuant to s 65dac of the act, an order for equal shared parental responsibility requires the parents to make together, and jointly, decisions about major long-term issues affecting the children. 100 the parties have agreed to orders for equal shared parental responsibility. 101 as a consequence s 65daa must be applied. 102 i am satisfied that any orders made allowing the father to spend time with x either 5 days or 6 days each fortnight are reasonably practicable and in x\u2019s best interests. the orders proposed by all parties are consistent with s 65daa(2) as they allow the father to spend substantial and significant time with x on weekends, days on holidays, days during the week, and events special to the parent and to the child. further, the orders enable the father to be involved in the child\u2019s daily routine and therefore accords with the s 65daa(2) definition of substantial and significant time. the time is considered substantial and significant regardless of whether the father spends five days or six days of time with x. conclusions the default position on parental responsibility & communications 103 the father seeks an order that in the event there is no engagement by either of the parties in the decision-making process, there is a way forward with the decision-making ability being allocated to the moving party on the issue. 104 the father submits that such a mechanism will encourage the parties to engage in the decision-making process. he gives a number of examples where the mother has failed to engage with him on an issue. equally, the mother gives a number of examples of issues where the father has not been prepared to engage either. the school enrolment issue that unfolded during the trial highlighted the mother\u2019s lack of insight into what \u201cequal shared parental responsibility\u201d means in practice. she was asked to reflect on this by counsel for the father and she said: \u201ci told you my reasons, i stand by them\u201d. 105 whilst i understand the father\u2019s reasons for seeking the parental responsibility order he does, i am not convinced that the order will address the issue. it might act to cause the mother to feel pressured by the requests of the paternal family. it might also lead to occasions where the parents argue over whether there has been genuine engagement. alternatively, with the range of complex matters that arise from parenting x, it might be difficult for the parties to agree on what is a \u201cday to day\u201d decision as opposed to the long-term decisions that fall under the definition of parental responsibility. ultimately conflict over such matters distracts the parties from focussing on making good joint decisions about x\u2019s ongoing care. 106 i note that the parties are yet to complete an intake for family therapy and, with the icl\u2019s support, i will order that this is completed within 42 days. 107 included in the hundreds of pages of exhibits and tenders were entries by the parties in a \u201ccommunication book\u201d. the communication book is maintained by the mother and the father\u2019s household in detail. i am concerned that its completion involves excessive recordkeeping that might be unnecessary once x moves to spending time with the parents in two blocks each fortnight. 108 the paternal grandparents were critical of the accuracy of matters recorded and thought it did not lead to more active engagement on matters. the mother was enthusiastic about her use of the my family wizard app although the father was less positive. given the need for the parties to improve their parental communications, i will make an order that they preference the use of the my family wizard app for their communications about x. specific orders about attending events, medical appointments and engagement with the national disability insurance scheme 109 i have made orders largely in line with the icl\u2019s proposed orders which were agreed by the parties. they provide mechanisms to allow the parties to attend x\u2019s appointments and extra-curricular activities. 110 as the cancellation and/or rescheduling of some of x\u2019s appointments has been an issue for the parties, an order will be made requiring the party who is responsible for taking x to an event to contact the other parent and invite them to attend with x in the event that they become unable to do so. spend time orders 111 the mother, father and icl all took slightly different positions on x\u2019s transition to block time. 112 the father seeks an order that x spends 6 nights each fortnight with him. he proposes that it be broken across two blocks until term three in 2022 (thursday \u2013 monday in week one and then wednesday \u2013 friday in week two). 113 the mother proposes that x spends five nights each fortnight with the father. she proposes that it be taken as a block each alternate week from thursday until tuesday. 114 the icl proposes that x spend five nights each fortnight with the father and that it be broken across two blocks until term three in 2022, from which it will as a block each alternate week from thursday until tuesday. 115 the single expert gave important evidence as outlined above. her evidence was influenced by two issues: x\u2019s capacity to move to a longer period with each parent, and the preference of avoiding too much change as x commences school. 116 there was agreement by all witnesses that x will most likely settle once he moves to a consistent and stable arrangement with a longer block of time in each household. it will give him stability between the two households, whether he is with the father for 5 nights or 6 nights. 117 there was little evidence to guide a decision about whether x, given his medical conditions, will need more time to transition into a block period with the father. it is clear that he has what counsel for the father described as \u201cthe entire family dynamic available at the father\u2019s home\u201d. x has a close and loving relationship with his father, aunt and grandparents. they have all been engaged in his treatment for several years now. they do not report challenging behaviour when x is with them and that could well be, as counsel for the father acknowledged, because his care is shared across three adults in the home. 118 the single expert agreed that x could trial five days consecutively now, which led the mother to propose that it begin immediately. the icl preferred a more cautious approach, and i am equally concerned about the impact on x of changing his arrangements mid-way through the school year. if he were to commence a five night arrangement now, he would have four months to settle into it before the school year commences. in arriving at this conclusion i am influenced by the mother proposing it, and the father supporting it, as she knows x the best. 119 i have no doubt that the father and the paternal family will continue to engage with x and his activities that take place during times when he is in the mother\u2019s care. for example, now that changeovers are not taking place on a saturday, the father may still attend x\u2019s swimming lessons and see him there. if he commences soccer next year, the father may arrange to take him to some games or attend his training. 120 i am confident that these parents will embrace their co-parenting of x as he grows. the parents were supportive of facilitating communication between x and the other parent, when he is in their care. for this reason, i do not see the need to make a formal order for contact when x is in the care of one parent. 121 i also have to consider whether the father\u2019s time with x should increase to a block of six nights into the future. i am not prepared to make this order. x has been diagnosed with autism and exhibits challenging behaviours. the single expert remarked, the focus should not be on the quantity of time but the quality of it. x has complex needs, requires consistency and stability. therefore a cautious approach is warranted. for now i think that is more likely achieved by a longer block period of nine nights with his mother. what provision should be made for christmas day and other days of significance to the mother? 122 the parties were in agreement about how x will spend his time during school holidays and on most special occasions. 123 i have included provision for x to spend thanksgiving and halloween with the mother as these are days of significance to her. 124 there was a small issue over the timing of christmas day changeovers. i have made orders consistent with the icl\u2019s, and the father\u2019s minute so that changeovers will take place at 5pm, as this does not interfere with lunch arrangements. international travel 125 the parties both agree to an order permitting them to travel internationally with x. for this purpose they will apply for an australian passport. 126 each party sought an order that they hold the passport. 127 the mother holds dual citizenship with the united states of america. on one occasion shortly after separation she said she was considering returning to the usa with x. she has taken no steps to do so, and gave convincing evidence that she now considers australia their home. there are no flight risk concerns except that she has residency status in the united states. for this reason, i will make an order that the father holds x\u2019s australian passport. 128 the mother also seeks an order that the father do all acts and things to sign documents that will allow x to obtain united states citizenship, a united states passport and a social security number. there was no evidence led about the obtaining of united states citizenship and a social security number apart from that it could be useful for x in the future. i see no reason why the parties cannot obtain a united states passport for x, provided that it too is held by the father. whether an order should be made requiring the mother to attend upon her psychiatrist and gp to monitor her mental health. 129 the mother was frank about her mental health and treatment plan. she has to see her gp in order to obtain medication, and has no history of self-medicating or ceasing her medication without medical advice. on that basis i will make an order that she continues to attend upon her gp to monitor her mental health and that she adheres to any medication or therapy as recommended by any of her treaters. i do not see the necessity to make the more specific order sought by the father. 130 i thank the legal representatives and the parties for their assistance and the way they conducted themselves through the trial. x has complex needs but is blessed to have a group of adults in his life who support him, love him and are all prepared to rise above their own interpersonal issues and put the needs for x\u2019s care, development and support above their own. 131 i wish x the very best for the future and thank you all for taking the time to ensure that the orders made by this court best support him and your relationships with him. associate: dated: 1 november 2021 [1]the agreed orders are contained in exhibit 7 and referred to as

matter proceeded on an undefended basis on 30 january 2023, the respondent husband telephoned our office to advise of his position in these proceedings. the respondent husband repeated that the matter was quite \u201csimple\u201d and that everything should be divided equally. he should [sic.] could not afford to continue payments for our client\u2019s care. at the date of affirming this affidavit, the respondent husband has not filed any responding material outlining his position. [as written] when the court may proceed on an undefended basis ] [...] having regard to the circumstances in which the initial proceedings took place in the absence of mr allesch (the appellant), it is worth emphasising that the principle just described does not require that the decision-maker actually hear (or receive the submissions of) the party potentially liable to be adversely affected. sometimes, through stubbornness, confusion, misunderstanding, fear or other emotions, a party may not take advantage of the opportunity to be heard, although such opportunity is provided. affording the opportunity is all that the law and principle require. [39] decision-makers, including the courts, cannot generally force people to protect their own rights, to adduce evidence or other materials, to present submissions or to act rationally in their own best interests. this consideration may be especially relevant in relation to the family court where emotions, often engendered by the highly personal issues involved, can sometimes cloud rational thought. [40] nor are courts obliged to delay proceedings indefinitely because one party, although proved to be on notice of the proceedings, refuses or fails to appear in person or to be represented by a lawyer or some other individual permitted to speak for them who can explain the need for an adjournment. the rights of other parties are commonly involved. in the family court, the rights of non-parties (especially children) may be affected. additionally (as this court has itself accepted), the rights of the public in the efficient discharge by courts of their functions must be weighed against unreasonable delay in concluding litigation. [footnotes omitted] the application statutory framework justice and equity the 4-step approach first, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of the hearing. second, the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. third, the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), (the other factors) including, because of s 79(4)(e), the matters referred to in s 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourth, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case: step 1: property interests step 2: contributions the outset of the relationship during the relationship $10,000 for the purchase of an animal by the wife, (b) $80,000 for renovations at the suburb c property, (c) $30,000 for an outstanding loan payment on motor vehicle 3 solely in the wife\u2019s name, (d) $16,000 for motor vehicle 4 solely in the husband\u2019s name, (e) $140,000 for the repayment of the anz loan, (f) $85,000 toward the purchase of an investment property in suburb e (suburb e property), and (g) $50,000 for renovations to the suburb e property $80,000 for renovations at the suburb c property, (c) $30,000 for an outstanding loan payment on motor vehicle 3 solely in the wife\u2019s name, (d) $16,000 for motor vehicle 4 solely in the husband\u2019s name, (e) $140,000 for the repayment of the anz loan, (f) $85,000 toward the purchase of an investment property in suburb e (suburb e property), and (g) $50,000 for renovations to the suburb e property $30,000 for an outstanding loan payment on motor vehicle 3 solely in the wife\u2019s name, (d) $16,000 for motor vehicle 4 solely in the husband\u2019s name, (e) $140,000 for the repayment of the anz loan, (f) $85,000 toward the purchase of an investment property in suburb e (suburb e property), and (g) $50,000 for renovations to the suburb e property $16,000 for motor vehicle 4 solely in the husband\u2019s name, (e) $140,000 for the repayment of the anz loan, (f) $85,000 toward the purchase of an investment property in suburb e (suburb e property), and (g) $50,000 for renovations to the suburb e property $140,000 for the repayment of the anz loan, (f) $85,000 toward the purchase of an investment property in suburb e (suburb e property), and (g) $50,000 for renovations to the suburb e property $85,000 toward the purchase of an investment property in suburb e (suburb e property), and (g) $50,000 for renovations to the suburb e property $50,000 for renovations to the suburb e property events following separation conclusion as to contributions those same principles can be expressed as saying that the requirements of the section are met by approaching the assessment of contributions holistically and by analysing the nature, form, characteristics and origin of the property currently comprising that to which s 79 applies, and, in turn, analysing the nature, form and extent of the contributions (of all types) contemplated by s 79). that task is also undertaken by reference to the nature and form of the particular marriage partnership manifested by the particular circumstances of this particular marriage. is it, for example, a relationship, as deane j put it in mallett at clr 640\u2013 1, alr 222, fam lr 473 \u201c...where the parties have adopted the attitude that their marriage constituted a practical union of both lives and property...\u201d or is it, for example, a union where parties lived very separate domestic and financial lives? the initial contribution the wife\u2019s inheritance step 3: section 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g) factors parties\u2019 earning capacity the husband\u2019s non-disclosure and the his premature appropriation of marital assets for his own benefit \u2013 s. 75(2)(o) 6] under well established guidelines [authorities omitted] property settlement orders may make more generous provision for one party if it is inferred the other party improperly failed to fully disclose his or her financial affairs. however, when a trial court infers a party\u2019s failure to disclose, it is worthy of consideration whether the failure relates to assets or income, because the receipt of undisclosed income over a period of time, without more, does not necessarily permit an inference to be drawn that the money is stashed away and available at will to the recalcitrant party. just because an inference may be drawn does not mean it always must or should be drawn. [emphasis added] superannuation legal principles the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation, actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse\u2019s present and/or future entitlements under the fund. the facts of this case conclusions mechanics as to the orders associate: dated: 25 may 2023 dated: 25 may 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "972.txt", "size": 18671, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 18884, "document_id": "972"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "972_chunk_0"}}

[ms radcliffe] did start preparing the evening meal more regularly after [ms j] went to melbourne in the last few years of our relationship. before that [ms j] and i prepared them, with me doing most of them before [ms j] was able to.[38] towards the end of our relationship, the respondent was becoming increasingly irrational, volatile and obsessive until i left out of concern for my safety and own mental health. these attitudes have continued and shape all interactions surrounding [x].[47] current circumstances documents to be relied upon and evidence given that [x] has a close relationship with both parents and considering that both parents present as being highly motivated and capable of meeting [x\u2019s] needs, it is recommended that [x] has the opportunity to spend equal amounts of time in both homes. given the parents\u2019 commitment to providing [x] with the stability, routine and structure that is necessary for him to thrive, it is expected that [x] is likely to have the capacity to transition to an equal shared care arrangement. his adhd symptoms are currently very well managed with the use of medication and adherence to the routines and strategies that are implemented within both homes.[89] summary of dr h pai results for ms radcliffe summary of dr h pai results for mr marsters dr h\u2019s general observations radcliffe] presented as being an open and honest individual who expressed herself articulately and intelligently. she expressed an adequate understanding of the current assessment.[96] marsters] presented as being an open, talkative and friendly individual. he presented as having a good understanding of the purpose of the current assessment, indicating he has previously been involved in other family law matters. during the interview, it was observed that [mr marsters] frequently digressed from the initial point of conversation, with him typically directing the conversation to discussions around [ms radcliffe\u2019s] various alleged shortcomings and parenting deficiencies.[97] presented as being a friendly, articulate and intelligent individual. despite being reassured that [x] could speak openly and honestly, it was observed that there was a general reluctance to provide any information that could potentially portray either of his parents in a less than favourable light. [x] presented as being intensely loyal to both his parents and it was clear that he cared very much about their feelings. he presented as being somewhat guarded when any issues were raised that related to any concerns that he may have in relation to his current and / or future care arrangements.[98] matters agreed assets ownership description applicants value respondent\u2019s value joint d street town e, tasmania $350, 000 respondent plant and equipment $152, 630 applicant motor vehicle 2 $23, 950 r bank shares $6, 223 s insurance $10, 949 nab account number ...19 $60 combined bank accounts $3, 493 $804 furniture & effects $3, 450 westpac shares $2,781 total $554, 340 liabilities applicant\u2019s value nab mortgage $127, 168 t financial services $2,000 hh lawyers (post-separation \u2013 legal costs) nil ms u (post-separation \u2013 legal costs) $129,168 net total - $425,172 superannuation superannuation fund 1 super account ... accumulation interest $153, 781.10 (as at 30 june 2022) superannuation fund 2 $36, 888.83 (as at 30 june 2022) superannuation fund 3 $47, 812.21 (as at 30 june 2021) $238, 482.14 financial resources applicant\u2019s value respondent\u2019s value long service leave entitlements (employer) e$28, 493 e$28, 493 (gross) notes: the applicant paid the entirety of the valuation costs upfront consisting of: (1) w valuers \u2013 valuation d street \u2013 total $4, 400.00 z valuers and auctioneers \u2013 valuation chattels \u2013 total $3, 080.00 the respondent is to pay 50% of these costs, totalling $3,740.00 and it is agreed such payment will be made on the happening of either the refinance of the mortgage and transfer of the d street property to the respondent, or the sale of the property and in the event of the latter such repayment to be made before balance sale proceeds are distributed between the parties. issues for determination issue 1: x\u2019s time with his parents during school terms and school holidays issue 2: whether the parties' superannuation interests should be dealt with in a separate pool? in summary, then, the trial judge has a discretion as to how superannuation interests will be treated in a particular case. if superannuation is not included in the list of property but rather made the subject of a separate pool, it will be necessary where a splitting order is sought, or extremely prudent where no such splitting order is sought (in order to ensure that justice and equity is achieved) to: value the superannuation interest (according to the regulations if an order under part viiib is sought or according to the regulations or otherwise if no order is sought), (b) consider and make findings about the types of contributions referred to in s 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) which have been made by the parties to the superannuation interests on either a global approach or an asset by asset approach depending on the circumstances, (c) consider the other factors in s 79(4) being the matters in s 79(4)(d), (e), (f) and (g), and (d) ensure that pursuant to s 79(2) the orders in relation to the parties' property, and any order under part viiib in relation to superannuation interests are just and equitable. in the context of a consideration of the matters referred to in sub-paragraph (b) and (c) of the last paragraph, the following matters may well be relevant: the relationship between years of fund membership and cohabitation, actual contributions made by the fund member at the commencement of the cohabitation (if applicable), at separation and at the date of hearing, preserved and non-preserved resignation entitlements at those times, and any factors peculiar to the fund or to the spouse's present and/or future entitlements under the fund.[110] issue 3: whether the parties' contributions to the non-superannuation pool should be regarded as equal issue 4: whether there should be an adjustment in percentage terms to the respondent for matters set out in s 75(2)? issue 5: whether the applicant should pay the respondent spousal maintenance? issue 6: should orders be made to ensure that the respondent retains the property at d street, town e? standard of proof the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. parenting parenting orders: the law x\u2019s best interests: the s 60cc factors section 60cc(2)(a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents what these definitions convey is that \"meaningful\", when used in the context of \"meaningful relationship\", is synonymous with \"significant\" which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for \"important\" or \"of consequence\". i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant.[120] it seems to me that the final conclusion reached by the federal magistrate that the proposed relocation would jeopardise the relationship between the children and their father to an unacceptable extent was not at all consistent with the evidence that was before the federal magistrate. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship.[121] presents as having a close bond and relationship with both his parents. [x] clearly enjoys spending time in both homes and he presents as having only positive feelings around his relationships and the level of connection he has established with the family members in both homes.[122] section 60cc(2)(b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence this will give [x] the greatest opportunity to maintain meaningful relationships with the parents and provide him with the greatest protection from the conflict and negative dynamic advanced by the father. the father, to cope with week about, will require engagement with intensive targeted family therapy and restrictions on his communications about his own negative and hostile thoughts to enable him to rebuild positive attitudes to the mother's parenting.[124] section 60cc(3)(a): any views expressed by the child, and the weight to be accorded to those views given their age and level of maturity the terms of s60cc(3)(a) itself may be taken to recognise that, whilst a child\u2019s views ought to be given proper consideration, their importance in a given case may depend upon factors such as the child\u2019s age or maturity and level of understanding of what is involved in the choice they have expressed. children may not, for example, appreciate the long term implications of separation from one parent or the child\u2019s siblings. section 60cc requires that attention be given by the court to these matters.[125] towards the end of the appointment, once [x] presented as feeling more comfortable and less guarded, i asked [x] to consider how he would feel if it was decided that he could spend equal amounts of time with his mum and dad, he said \u201cokay\u201d. when asked to consider how he would feel if it was decided that his current living arrangements would not change, he said, \u201cokay\u201d. [x] appeared to be genuinely nonplussed when considered both these options. although he could not provide further reasoning or information in relation to this issue, his body language (smiling, thumbs up) indicated that he appeared to be relaxed and comfortable when considering either of these options for his living arrangements.[126] section 60cc(3)(b): the nature of the relationship of the child

implementing an arrangement of that kind, and (d) the impact that an arrangement of that kind would have on the child, and (e) such other matters as the court considers relevant.[135] equal time given that [x] has a close relationship with both parents and considering that both parents present as being highly motivated and capable of meeting [x\u2019s] needs, it is recommended that [x] has the opportunity to spend equal amounts of time in both homes. given the parents\u2019 commitment to providing [x] with the stability, routine and structure that is necessary for him to thrive, it is expected that [x] is likely to have the capacity to transition to an equal shared care arrangement. his adhd symptoms are currently very well managed with the use of medication and adherence to the routines and strategies that are implemented within both his homes.[136] substantial and significant time for the purposes of subsection (2), a child will be taken to spend substantial and significant time with a parent only if: (a) the time the child spends with the parent includes both: the time the child spends with the parent includes both: days that fall on weekends and holidays, and (ii) days that do not fall on weekends or holidays, and (b) the time the child spends with the parent allows the parent to be involved in: (i) the child's daily routine, and (ii) occasions and events that are

allows the child to be involved in occasions and events that are of special significance to the parent. the time the child spends with the parent allows the child to be involved in occasions and

section 75(2)(o): any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account in considering whether the justice of a case requires some act done by a party to be taken into account under s.75(2)(o), the court should, we think, have regard primarily to the existence or otherwise of any legal obligations, as between the parties, in relation to the doing of that act, and also, perhaps, to ordinary notions of justice and equity between the parties. in this case, the applicant had a legal duty to maintain the children of her prior marriage, which duty had primacy over the duty of any other person, other than the children's respondent, to so maintain them: ss.66a and 66b of the act. the respondent, on the other hand, had no legal duty to maintain these children at any time during the marriage because, by s.66g, a step-parent has such a duty only if he or she is a guardian of the child, or has custody of the child by an order of a court, or a court having jurisdiction under part vii of the act by order determines that it is proper for the step-parent to have that duty. none of those pre-conditions existed in this case. accordingly, in contributing to the support of these children the applicant was merely honouring a legal obligation which she owed to the children, whilst the respondent, in making his contribution, was acting essentially as a volunteer assisting the applicant in the discharge of her legal obligations. upon that basis, whilst we consider the justice of the case clearly required the respondent's contribution to be taken into account under s 75(2)(o), the same cannot be said of the applicant's contribution. in making that contribution the applicant was in no way discharging or assisting to discharge any legal obligation of the respondent.\u201d[171] section 75(2)(p): the terms of any financial agreement that is binding on the parties to the marriage section 75(2)(q): the terms of any

79(4)(d)-(g), including s 75(2) \u2014 other factors conclusion regarding the parties' superannuation entitlements final assessment: a just and equitable exercise of discretion? ... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[177] spousal maintenance spousal maintenance: the law in lee steere and lee steere [1985] famca 57, (1985) flc 91-626 the court viewed the exercise that is required in proceedings under sec. 79 as incorporating two steps. firstly the ascertainment of contribution and then the consideration of the relevant matters set out in sec. 75(2). it is the combined application of the past contributions and the sec. 75(2) elements that bring a court to make an order that is just and equitable within the meaning of sec. 79. an order for maintenance, be it periodic or by way of lump sum, which is intended to be caught by the provisions of sec. 66l, 77a and 87a is something that is looked at generally after the sec. 79 matters have been attended to. it may require an additional transfer of property or payment of lump sum over and above the proposed order which has already been arrived at by the application of sec. 79 principles. (emphasis added) a party to a marriage is liable to maintain the other party, to the extent that the first-mentioned party is reasonably able to do so, if, and only if, that other party is unable to support herself or himself adequately... (a) by reason of having the care and control of a child of the marriage who has not attained the age of 18 years, (b) by reason of age or physical or mental incapacity for appropriate gainful employment, or (c) for any other adequate reason, that threshold is whether the applicant \u201cis unable to support herself or himself adequately\u201d by reason of the matters set out in (a), (b), or (c) of that section, but having regard to any relevant matter referred to in sub-section 75(2). thus, the question of whether the applicant can support herself \u201cadequately\u201d is not to be determined by reference to any fixed or absolute standard but having regard to the matters referred to in s 75(2) and more specifically the paragraphs of that sub-section identified above. nor is that question to be determined upon a \u201csubsistence\u201d level, as earlier cases under state maintenance legislation suggested. in nutting and nutting (1978) flc 90-410 at 77, 094 lindenmayer j said:- \u201cby sec. 72 of the act, the respondent is liable to maintain the applicant only to the extent that she is incapable of supporting herself adequately, and again \u2018adequately\u2019 imports a standard of living which is reasonable in the circumstances, including the circumstances that the parties are no longer husband and wife and that the assets and resources which were formerly available to them both in common have now been divided between them.\u201d (emphasis added) 1. a threshold finding under s72, 2. consideration of s74 and s75(2), no fettering principles that pre-separation standard of living must automatically be awarded where the respondent\u2019s means permit, and discretion exercised in accordance with the provisions of s 74 with \u201creasonableness in the circumstances\u201d as the guiding principle.[181] is the respondent unable to support himself adequately? is the applicant reasonably able to pay maintenance? associate: dated: 25 may 2023 dated: 25 may 2023 [1] when discussing parenting issues the parties will still be referred to applicant or respondent.[2] trial affidavit of mr marsters 26 october 2022 [6], [8] (\u2018respondent\u2019s trial affidavit\u2019).[3] single expert report of dr h, 6 june 2022, 26 (\u2018single expert report\u2019).

in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. section 79(4) prescribes matters that must be taken into account in considering what order (if any) should be made under the section. the requirements of the two sub-sections are not to be conflated. in every case in which a property settlement order under s 79 is sought, it is necessary to satisfy the court that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.\u201d the expression \u201cjust and equitable\u201d is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.\u201d [footnotes omitted] firstly, in order to ascertain whether it

that one or the other party has the right to a property adjustment order. the court must give separate consideration to s.79(2) in addition to the matters referred to in s.79(4). associate: dated: 25

been the subject of many authorities in this court. in ajo & gro [2005] famcafc 104, (2005) flc 93-218 at [30] , following kowaliw & kowaliw [1981] famca 70, (1981) flc 91-092 and townsend & townsend [1994] famca 144, (1995) flc 92-569 (\u201ctownsend\u201d), the full court held that add backs fall into \u201cthree clear categories\u201d. where [sic] the parties have expended money on legal fees, where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets, and \u201cwaste\u201d or wanton, negligent, or reckless dissipation of assets. this latter category indicates that the nature of the expenditure of post-separation or premature distributions can be relevant to the exercise of discretion to add back. ... 58. in our view, these authorities establish four relevant propositions. first, adding back property which has been distributed and spent is discretionary, and reflects an exceptional exercise of the discretion as an \u201caccounting\u201d or \u201cbalance sheet\u201d exercise for the purposes of ss 79(2) and (4) to achieve justice and equity between the parties. secondly, the nature of the expenditure reflected in add backs is relevant, and reasonably incurred expenditure does not usually come within accepted categories of add back. thirdly, the decision in stanford [(2012) 247 clr 108, [2012] hca 52], followed by bevan[(2014) flc 39 \u2013 572, [2014] famcafc 19], does not necessarily require the conclusion that adding back notional property is per se an error, but proper consideration must be given to existing interests in property. fourthly, in cases which are not exceptional, expended interim distributions can be taken up under s 75(2) rather than as part of the balance sheet exercise.\u201d drawing against the mortgage over the property at

sending [x] to visit with you at your brother\u2019s house because of your past history of abusive behaviour\u201d. the mother also said that \u201cadditionally, it has been several months since you have seen [x]. she is young and a few months is a long time to her. you are a virtual stranger to her and she is at an age where separation anxiety is an issue. i don\u2019t feel that sending her to spend time with you is the best choice for her emotional well-being at this point in time as she simply doesn\u2019t know you. these proceedings child inclusive conference memorandum the mother impressed as holding a high level of mistrust towards the father and believes that he lacks in parenting skills and may \u201clash out\u201d in an emotionally abusive way towards [x]. whilst the mother reported she is no longer fearful of the father, she does not want to engage in verbal communication with him with her preference being for email or text messages. at the end of the observation session, the mother, infant maternal half-brother ([l]) and the stepfather were brought into the observation room by the writer and [x] appeared to become still and put her head down. this may indicate that [x] experienced a level of discomfort with regards to all parties being in the same room. the writer encourages [x] to say goodbye to the father and let her know that she would now spend some time playing with the mother, stepfather and [l].

[late] 2012, [x] returned home again, miserable and quiet. i asked her if she is okay, [x] said \u201che said dont tell you\u201d. my husband and i told her that shes safe, she can tell us anything and she wont get into trouble. [x] then said \u201che smacked me again\u201d. and expressed to us that she \u201cnever wants to go back to him not forever\u201d. 24. we drove directly to the [suburb r] police station [on a day in late] 2021 after she had told us this again and i received advice from an officer who advised me to stop all visitations at this time and to report these things to the department of child safety. 25. we then went to a friends home for dinner after the police station and upon returning home [x] had a shower. [x] was in the shower and i began to hear her cry, i walked in and asked her what is wrong. [x] told me that her \u201cbum bum\u201d was hurting. i asked what had happened (assuming she had somehow hurt it in the shower). [x] than stated \u201c[mr potter] did it\u201d. i asked her if i could see her bottom to see if i could notice anything that may be causing her some pain in the shower. i noticed a scratch in the crack of her bottom and ask her how it happened. she said again \u201che did it\u201d. [x] finished her shower and myself and my husband sat down with her in our lounge room and asked her where this happened, if he had a wet wipe, if she had pooped and was he just wiping her and accidentally scratcher her. [x] clearly stated that there was no wet wipe, she did not poo that day, that it happened in the lounge room once [uncle mr n] had left and that his finger was in her bottom. we asked why he was doing that and [x] said he said \u201cbecause he wanted too\u201d. the stepfather\u2019s version of what occurred in late 2021 17.on [a day in late] 2021, i distinctly recall [x's] demeanour was again unusual. she was very quiet and seem disheartened. my wife asked [x] if she is okay and [x] expressed to us that [mr potter] said \"he said don't tell you\". she mentioned that she ''never wants to go back also stated that he had smacked her yet again. 18. my wife and i drove directly to the [suburb r] police station [on a day in late] 2021 where my wife went inside for some advice regarding the situation and i stayed in the car. 19. after this, myself, my wife, [x] and our son visited a friends home for dinner. 20. when we returned home my wife assisted [x] into the shower and i was sitting on our couch which is within ears reach of the shower. my wife had also come out into the lounge room and we then heard [x] began to scream and cry. [ms rubra] bolted into the shower and i heard [x] say ''my bum bum is hurting\" while crying. i then heard her say \"[mr potter] did it\" repeating that twice. i then got up to see what was going on and saw a nail scratch on the crack of her bottom. my wife and i asked [x] a series of questions to ensure that we were understanding [x's] experience correctly. she very clearly stated that this didn't happen while her bottom was being wiped and that it happened once [uncle mr n] bas left the home and it was in the lounge room. [x] stated clearly that his finger was in her bottom. 21. we asked [x] why he did this to her and [x] stated that [mr potter] said \"because he wanted too\". aftermath the trial exhibit 1 and exhibit 2 investigating officer attempted numerous phone calls and text messages to the mother of the child to speak with her. all attempts to make contact with the mother have been unsuccessful, further attempts have also been made to speak with the mother\u2019s partner without success. advice would be provided that as the child is only three years old and it is unlikely that the child will not particularise offences during a 93a statement to a court standard due to her age. investigating officer has made several attempts to contact all parties without success. what can be gleaned from this evidence? how the allegation was made ...going out for the night and she found [x] in the shower crying. the mother said that [x] told her that the father had put his finger up her bottom. the mother said she walked out into the lounge where the stepfather was and asked [x] a number of different questions. the mother said that she understood that this had allegedly occurred in [mr n\u2019s] home whilst the father and [x] were by themselves. the mother said that [x] disclosed that the father had put his finger inside [x\u2019s] bottom and [x] had asked him to stop but the father said no. the change of allegation the demeanour of the child when making the allegation what x said to ms p 5.1 on 15 august 2022, i conducted an age-appropriate interview of [x] at my office in [town v]. [x] was able to tell me that her family consisted of her mummy and her daddy and her father's name is [mr k]. she said that she also has two brothers named [l] and [m]. when asked about [mr potter], [x] stated that she also sees \"[mr potter]\" but she doesn't know why. she stated, \"[mr potter] is another daddy\" and she likes seeing him. [x] then stated, \"he touched my private parts. he likes touching ladies' private parts\", and when asked how she knew this, [x] stated \"mummy told me\". [x] said that [ms rubra] had said some other things but \"i've forgotten what else mummy said\". 5.2 [x] stated that [mr potter] is not a good person because he touched her private parts at his house. i then asked [x] if she could tell me a little bit more about this and she stated she was in [mr potter's] bedroom and [mr potter] put his finger in her bottom but she couldn't remember what else. [x] then stated, \"i can remember that mummy told me that i can only see him at places where i'm safe\". 5.3 [x] appeared to be speaking in a very matter of fact manner and did not display any anxiety as she said this to me. [x] stated, \"i have two daddies, daddy [mr k] and daddy [mr potter] but daddy [mr k] and daddy [mr potter] are not good friends because daddy [mr k] doesn't like daddy [mr potter].\" when i asked [x] what she thought about [mr potter], she stated that she likes him and likes spending time with him. credibility of the stepfather discussion demeanour of x behaviour of the mother (and stepfather) problems the solution other aspects of the family report application of the act application of law to the circumstances of the case primary considerations \u2013 section 60b the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents (b) the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. it is important to x that she has a meaningful relationship with both her mother and father, and (b) there is a very great need to protect x from being exposed to the risk of family violence, harm or abuse, particularly emotional abuse. there is a very great need to protect x from being exposed to the risk of family violence, harm or abuse, particularly emotional abuse. both parents to their credit acknowledge that it is important for the children to have a meaningful relationship with the other parent. unfortunately, it is only the father who is committed to x having a meaningful relationship with the mother whereas the mother is not committed to x having a meaningful relationship with the father.

what is a reasonable excuse depends not only on the circumstances of the individual case but also on the purpose of the provision to which the defence of \u201creasonable excuse\u201d is an exception... ... however, the reality is that when legislatures enact defences such as \u201creasonable excuse\u201d they effectively give, and intend to give, to the courts, the power to determine the content of such defences. defences in this form are categories of indeterminate reference that have no content until a court makes its decision. they effectively require the courts to prescribe the relevant rule of conduct after the fact of its occurrence. that being so, the courts must give effect to the will of parliament and give effect to their own ideas of what is a \u201creasonable

dispute 2 the issues in dispute are: (a) whether the mother should have sole parental responsibility for x or whether equal shared parental responsibility between the parties, is in x\u2019s best interests, (b) what time x should spend with the parent she is not living with (and how), and (c) whether x should remain on the family law watchlist. whether the mother should have sole parental responsibility for x or whether equal shared parental responsibility between the parties, is in x\u2019s best interests, (b) what time x should spend with the parent she is not living with (and how), and (c) whether x should remain on the family law watchlist. 3 at the commencement of the hearing there was an issue raised by the father about which parent x should live with. the father under cross-examination said that in the event that the court made findings that x was at risk in the mother\u2019s household or care, he was prepared for the court to make an order that x live with him. this was also confirmed in his case outline document where he said: in the father\u2019s view, it is in the child\u2019s best interests to live with him. however the father understands that such outcome is unlikely in given circumstances where the child has lived wholly in the care of the mother since birth. if it were not for the serious concerns for the child\u2019s safety and healthy development, the father would be supportive of the child\u2019s continuing residence with the mother.[1] (as per the original) 4 by final submissions and after hearing the evidence the father consented to an order for x to remain living with the mother. background 5 the mother, ms longer was born in australia in 1993 and is aged 28 years. 6 the father, mr longer was born in 1979 and is aged 42 years. he is from a country b cultural background. 7 the parties commenced a relationship in 2016 and began cohabiting in approximately 2016. 8 the parties were married in 2016. 9 after they married they moved in with the maternal grandparents in suburb c, nsw and in february 2017 they moved to suburb d in city e, nsw. 10 the parties first separated in october 2017 when the mother left the former matrimonial home and moved in with her parents. 11 the parties\u2019 only child x was born in 2017. 12 on 7 december 2017 the parties separated on a final basis when x was one month old. 13 the father initiated proceedings on 25 may 2018 in the federal circuit court in newcastle seeking equal shared parental responsibility, that x live with the mother and spend time with him on a graduated basis. 14 the proceedings were transferred to the sydney registry of the federal circuit court and on 20 december 2018 a child dispute conference memorandum was prepared. at that time the father was employed and residing in country ee but intended to return to the city e area to live. 15 the father has lived interstate and overseas for periods of time since separation. he says that since this time he has visited the child at least once per month, when allowed by the mother. at other times he has been visiting the child up to twice per week as per court orders. at times when the father was unable to visit the child, he says that he has communicated with her via skype, typically twice per week. 16 the mother deposes that the father travelled a lot during 2018 both prior to and after the father initiated court proceedings. 17 on 9 may 2019 interim orders were made for x to spend supervised time with the father at a contact centre. the first supervised visit took place on 13 june 2019. 18 in 2019 the father\u2019s son f was born. 19 in 2019 the father married ms g the mother of his son f. ms g was born in country h in 1999 and is 22 years old. 20 on 26 august 2019 further interim orders were made for x to spend unsupervised time with the father. 21 following the father\u2019s first unsupervised visit the mother alleged that x looked \u201cpassed out,...worn out and dehydrated\u201d.[2] the mother took x to the doctor and was advised that she may have had \u201cminor heat stroke\u201d and \u201cpossibly heat exhaustion\u201d.[3] 22 in 2019 paediatrician dr j assessed x as having a developmental delay. 23 in or around february 2020 the father relocated to tasmania with his wife and their child, f. 24 a family report was prepared on 1 june 2020. 25 on 2 august 2020 x spent time with the father following five months of no contact due to covid-19 lockdowns and subsequent state border closures. during this visit, the mother alleges that when x was returned to her care she appeared drowsy and was dressed in the father\u2019s wife\u2019s shirt.[4] 26 on 17 september 2020 orders were made for the father to communicate with x via skype. the orders noted that the father was living and working interstate. 27 on 13 december 2020, the mother alleges that when she returned to collect x from spending time with the father she was only wearing a nappy and her jumper.[5] 28 on 7 july 2021 x undertook an online assessment through the suburb k early childhood assessment team (pecat) and was diagnosed with global developmental delay (gdd). 29 on 27 july 2021 a child inclusive conference memorandum was prepared. 30 on 29 july 2021 x was physically assessed and diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (asd). 31 on 2 august 2021 the matter proceeded to a final hearing over three days. 32 as at the date of the final hearing: (a) the mother continues to reside with x, the maternal aunts (ms l aged 21 and ms m aged 19) and the maternal grandparents\u2019 in suburb c, new south wales.

[the father]: yes, i was. [counsel for the icl]: and you would have been aware that therefore you were entitled to have a lawyer represent you without you having to pay any fees \u2013 any private fess for the purpose of these proceedings? [the father]: yes. [counsel for the icl]: is there a reason why you elected not to have a lawyer represent you then, under those circumstances? [the father]: because...responsibility not to waste public funds...torturing my former wife with cross-examination will probably not bring a dramatic improvement on my position. 42 as a consequence, the mother was only cross-examined by the icl. the father was invited at the conclusion of the cross-examination of the mother to put forward any questions that he would like asked of the mother. the majority of these questions were put by the icl and he was invited to make submissions on some other matters. 43 ms s, the family consultant was required for cross-examination. 44 apart from the family consultant, the only witnesses called were the parties. 45 i will at this point make some comments on the parties and the credit of the witnesses. 46 the father is an articulate, engaging and intelligent man. despite his decision not to instruct a lawyer, he managed his representation competently. as a witness he was thoughtful about the parental conflict and had no difficulty expressing his views on it and many other topics, even when he was not asked to comment on the issues. while i find that he gave honest evidence, he often lacked insight into his own behaviour and his impact on those around him. 47 i found the mother to be an honest and straightforward witness. she answered the questions asked of her directly and did not attempt to give self-serving answers. she was a credible witness. 48 the mother filed affidavits in support from the maternal grandparents, mr t and ms u. they required a country v interpreter and none could be arranged. the father had filed an affidavit in support from ms w but she was not available for cross-examination. ultimately, these affidavits were not relied upon. 49 the family consultant prepared three reports in this matter as follows: (1) child dispute conference memorandum dated 20 december 2018, (2) family report dated 1 june 2020 (\u201cfamily report\u201d), and (3) child inclusive conference memorandum dated 27 july 2021 (\u201ccic memorandum\u201d) child dispute conference memorandum dated 20 december 2018, (2) family report dated 1 june 2020 (\u201cfamily report\u201d), and (3) child inclusive conference memorandum dated 27 july 2021 (\u201ccic memorandum\u201d) 50 the family consultant did not interview x. the most recent reports were undertaken during the covid-19 global pandemic. all meetings were conducted by telephone. 51 in the family report the family consultant made a range of recommendations premised on what findings the court would make about the respective allegations of the parties and any findings of risk to x. 52 she attended court and was cross-examined. she gave strident and confronting evidence. her evidence caused the father to assert that she \u201csounded biased\u201d and he asked whether she had any personal experience (presumably as a victim of family violence). in his written submissions he sought that her evidence be dismissed saying:[7] the family consultant appears to have excessive fixation on fighting patriarchy and made an impression that she won\u2019t let facts get in the way of her story easily. in fact listening to her passionate constructions, i could help feeling for her \u2013 perhaps i wasn\u2019t alone thinking that in her work she must be reliving some of her own trauma. i made it clear i didn\u2019t mean to prey when i asked her whether she herself has been a subject to coercive control. if she hadn\u2019t been subject to coercive control herself, it must have been some other traumatising experiences that let her to her emotive, extravagant performance at the cross examination. i am genuinely concerned that ms s is not capable of objective assessment. it may be self evident, but i would like the court to dismiss her evidence and get another family consultant involved or take her evidence with a good pinch of salt. (as per the original) 53 the family consultant addressed the father\u2019s concern under cross-examination saying:[8] my personal experience of family violence does not have any bearing on this matter. i have got experience having interviewed many, many men who have been determined to have been perpetrators of coercive and controlling family violence, and interestingly, most of them tend to lay the blame for their behaviour and what they\u2019ve done at the feet of others like a family consultant, or any other person, because there\u2019s an inability to see within themselves what\u2019s truly happening - what the real issue is. 54 she outlined her extensive experience in the field of family violence which includes: (a) a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work, (b) employment as a family consultant at the federal circuit court and family court of australia since 2016, (c) four years employment as a principal counsellor & consultant at y counselling, (d) employment as a child sexual assault counsellor at z organisation, and (e) employment as a family support officer at aa group. a bachelor\u2019s degree in social work, (b) employment as a family consultant at the federal circuit court and family court of australia since 2016, (c) four years employment as a principal counsellor & consultant at y counselling, (d) employment as a child sexual assault counsellor at z organisation, and (e) employment as a family support officer at aa group. she confirmed that she herself has no lived experience as a victim of family violence. 55 the family consultant gave helpful evidence. she is well qualified to express opinions in this area given her specialised knowledge based on her training, study and experience. 56 however, her evidence was complicated by the release of the pecat assessment report about x after her three reports had been written. x\u2019s diagnosis of gdd and asd adds another layer of complexity to the matters before the court, especially the assessment of risk. 57 under cross-examination, the family consultant helpfully answered questions about x\u2019s development, the recent diagnosis made in the pecat report and its impact on her recommendations. but at times she drew conclusions about risk that, on the evidence, could not be drawn. this led counsel for the icl to submit that i should not place great weight on the evidence she gave under cross-examination. 58 ultimately, it is a matter for the court to assess and review the evidence and make findings about significant matters in dispute. in reaching my conclusions, i have treated with caution some of the oral evidence the family consultant gave under cross-examination and where i have departed from her recommendations, i have outlined why. proposals 59 i will now consider the parties\u2019 proposals. 60 at the commencement of the trial, the mother\u2019s proposal was as follows: (a) that she have sole parental responsibility for x, (b) that x live with her, and (c) that x spend time with the father as determined by the court to be in her best interests but says that the father should only be granted overnight time with x when she is older, or otherwise when the father returns to sydney from tasmania. that she have sole parental responsibility for x, (b) that x live with her, and (c) that x spend time with the father as determined by the court to be in her best interests but says that the father should only be granted overnight time with x when she is older, or otherwise when the father returns to sydney from tasmania. 61 after the father had given his evidence, a minute of orders sought by the mother was prepared and tendered as exhibit 2. however, after hearing the evidence of the family consultant, the mother tendered a new minute of orders sought. in that document she sought more specific orders namely: (a) that x spend time with the father every last thursday of the month for a period of not more than two hours supervised by bb families or any other supervising agency, and the costs of the supervision and any report are to be met solely by the father, (b) that the father is to notify the mother of his inability to spend time with x within 28 days\u2019 notice in writing, (c) that changeover is to occur at the mother\u2019s residence with the supervisor collecting x for the commencement of time and the supervisor returning x to the mother\u2019s residence at the conclusion of time, (d) that x has skype communication with the father with such calls to be initiated between 11.00am -11.15am each monday and the mother is to facilitate such communication and ensure that x is available to communicate with the father at those times, (e) orders to facilitate the ongoing communication between the parties about matters pertaining to x, (f) an order permitting the mother to remove x from australia for travel at her discretion, and (g) an order restraining the father from removing x from australia and requiring that x\u2019s name be included on the family law watchlist for this purpose. that x spend time with the father every last thursday of the month for a period of not more than two hours supervised by bb families or any other supervising agency, and the costs of the supervision and any report are to be met solely by the father, (b) that the father is to notify the mother of his inability to spend time with x within 28 days\u2019 notice in writing, (c) that changeover is to occur at the mother\u2019s residence with the supervisor collecting x for the commencement of time and the supervisor returning x to the mother\u2019s residence at the conclusion of time, (d) that x has skype communication with the father with such calls to be initiated between 11.00am -11.15am each monday and the mother is to facilitate such communication and ensure that x is available to communicate with the father at those times, (e) orders to facilitate the ongoing communication between the parties about matters pertaining to x, (f) an order permitting the mother to remove x from australia for travel at her discretion, and (g) an order restraining the father from removing x from australia and requiring that x\u2019s name be included on the family law watchlist for this purpose. 62 the father proposes that: (a) the parents have shared parental responsibility, (b) x live with the mother, and spend time with the father graduating up to a half of each school holidays as well as each second weekend outside school holidays, and in the alternative, that she lives with the father, and (c) x\u2019s name be removed from the family law watchlist. the parents have shared parental responsibility, (b) x live with the mother, and spend time with the father graduating up to a half of each school holidays as well as each second weekend outside school holidays, and in the alternative, that she lives with the father, and (c) x\u2019s name be removed from the family law watchlist. 63 the icl, having considered all of the material filed and the evidence given during the hearing, prepared a minute of order on the final day of the hearing. the icl proposes that: (a) the mother have sole parental responsibility for x, (b) x live with the mother, (c) x spends time with the father for five hours once a month, progressing to eight hours once she commences school, with further specified phase in arrangements to increase the father\u2019s time, (d) x have electronic communication with the father for 15 minutes twice a week, and (e) specific orders to facilitate the ongoing communication between the parties about matters pertaining to x. the mother have sole parental responsibility for x, (b) x live with the mother, (c) x spends time with the father for five hours once a month, progressing to eight hours once she commences school, with further specified phase in arrangements to increase the father\u2019s time, (d) x have electronic communication with the father for 15 minutes twice a week, and (e) specific orders to facilitate the ongoing communication between the parties about matters pertaining to x. the child - x 64 before applying the law, information as to x, the subject child of these proceedings, needs to be captured. 65 x is currently 3 years old and will turn 4 this year. 66 at around 15 months of age x was assessed and diagnosed with gdd. concerns were also raised about x\u2019s \u201csocial abilities and communication\u201d. 67 the mother has been referred to the national disability insurance scheme (ndis) and the \u201clife start\u201d program, which reportedly led to funding for various other assessments conducted by the pecat diagnostic and assessment service, and the commencement of speech, occupational and behavioural therapy. 68 the pecat assessment was tendered and provides critical information about x\u2019s level of functioning. the report concluded that x \u201csatisfies dsm-5 criteria for autism spectrum disorder requiring very substantial support (level 3)\u201d. 69 of her current abilities, the pecat assessment noted: (a) x\u2019s vocabulary is currently limited to \u201ctwo or three simple words\u201d but has difficulty expressing what she wants, (b) she can follow familiar one step instructions, (c) x prefers to play in insolation. the mother states that she does not \u201cacknowledge people around her\u201d, (d) she wears nappies day and night, (e) she needs assistance with dressing, (f) she has limited danger awareness and has runaway previously in unfamiliar environments, (g) she can become upset when separating from her mother, (h) she has frequent temper tantrums, (i) she can be fussy about her food, and (j) she has sensory aversion to loud and unfamiliar noises and can become agitated. x\u2019s vocabulary is currently limited to \u201ctwo or three simple words\u201d but has difficulty expressing what she wants, (b) she can follow familiar one step instructions, (c) x

about her food, and (j) she has sensory aversion to loud and unfamiliar noises and can become agitated. 70 the mother has also consulted with a second paediatrician, dr cc. dr cc recommended that x commence day care. x now attends family day-care one day per week. the mother has applied for funding for a support person. 71 the father accepts the diagnoses that have been made of x. however, he raises the possibility that her symptoms are \u201csimilar to those manifest in abused and traumatised children.\u201d[9] he therefore raises the possibility that x \u201cis at an unacceptable risk of harm in a household undoubtedly plagued by physical and other abuse and severe mental health conditions.\u201d[10] 72 the father in his affidavit of 30 april 2019 at paragraph 2 said: despite the obstacles, x and i have a growing relationship. when i visit, she welcomes me with smile and arms stretched out. she cuddles me and leans forward to touch her face with mine in baby \u2018kisses\u2019. i bring her her favourite food (berries) and presents, and we spend time reading books and playing with toys. (as per the original) the law 73 the principles governing the determination of competing parenting applications are set out in part vii, family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d). 74 when making a parenting order, the court must consider what is in the best interests of the child pursuant to section 60ca, but, as succinctly put by justice murphy in hardie & capris [2010] famca 1046 at [48]: \u2018best interests\u2019 is not the application of a theoretical construct, but, rather, the practical application of a number of considerations relevant to the individual needs, desires, health and aspirations of the particular child of this parenting relationship. 75 as discussed by the full court in moose & moose [2008] famcacf 108 at [66], the role of the judicial officer in making orders which are in the best interests of the child is to determine the best interest having regard to: the matters set out in s 60cc(2) and (3) guided in consideration of the provisions by the objects set out in s 60b(1) and the principles underpinning it contained in s 60b(2). 76 as for the primary considerations, in the leading authority of mazorski & albright [2007] famca 520 (\u201cmazorski & albright\u201d), justice brown refers at [3] to such considerations as the \u201ctwin pillars\u201d where: (a) the first pillar is the importance of children having a meaningful relationship with both parents, and (b) the second pillar is the need to protect children from physical and emotional harm. the first pillar is the importance of children having a meaningful relationship with both parents, and (b) the second pillar is the need to protect children from physical and emotional harm. 77 the court must balance the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with her father with the primary consideration of protecting her from physical or psychological harm, and from being subjected or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. 78 the concept of \u201ca meaningful relationship\u201d has been discussed in many authorities, most significantly by justice brown in mazorski & albright. those authorities establish that \u201ca meaningful relationship\u201d is a qualitative concept. the relationship is not measured simply by the amount of time a child is spending with each parent, but the quality of the relationship that exists between a child and parent. 79 the distinct pathway which applies to parenting matters where an equal shared parental responsibility order has been made was the subject of much discussion by the high court in mrr & gr [2010] hca 4. this pathway does not take on as much significance here, because the father is not seeking orders for substantial and significant time with x. 80 for the sake of context, i will deal with the secondary additional considerations under s 60cc (3) of the act prior to drawing them together with the primary considerations in a final analysis as to what orders are in the best interests of x. additional considerations section 60cc(3)(b)the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child\u2019s parents, and (ii) other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) 81 the mother has been x\u2019s primary carer and attachment figure throughout her life. x also shares a close and loving relationship with her maternal grandparents and aunts who she has lived with since birth. it has been observed that the mother has \u201cgood support from her boyfriend, parents and extended family\u201d.[11] 82 the father has had little involvement in x\u2019s day to day care due to the periods of time he has been living interstate, overseas or travelling. on the impact of this, the family consultant observed at [84] of the family report that: [i]t is not surprising that there were previously some difficulties encountered in relation to x forming and solidifying an attachment relationship with mr longer because he has been either unable or unwilling to commit to a schedule of \u2018time\u2019 as has been determined by the court to be in x\u2019s best interests. this is regrettable and does seem lacking in child focus. if mr longer is unable to ensure he spend regular and consistent time with x moving forward, this would potentially cause x considerable confusion and stress in her relationship with him and, ultimately, she may become resistant to spending time with him entirely. 83 the involvement of the parties in x\u2019s day to day care led the family consultant to conclude at [89] that: [f]or x, it would likely be extremely stressful to spend extensive periods away from her mother, at least at this time, and she would be considerably vulnerable to experiencing symptoms of anxiety, grief and loss if separated from her mother. 84 the family consultant supported the father spending time at the paternal residence because it would provide x with an opportunity to develop more meaningful relationships with her father, his wife and other paternal family members. 85 the mother has demonstrated her capacity and eagerness to provide for the needs of x and encourage her emotional and intellectual development. 86 the pecat report observed that: (a) \u201c[the] mother has diligently formulated a comprehensive early intervention program consisting of speech therapy, occupational therapy, positive behaviour support and a supported playgroup.\u201d[12] (b) \u201cms longer should be commended for her efforts in formulating this program.\u201d[13] \u201c[the] mother has diligently formulated a comprehensive early intervention program consisting of speech therapy, occupational therapy, positive behaviour support and a supported playgroup.\u201d[12] (b) \u201cms longer should be commended for her efforts in formulating this program.\u201d[13] section 60cc(3)(c) the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity: (i) to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child 87 the mother says that despite the father\u2019s absence from x\u2019s life, she has continued to encourage the father to maintain a relationship with her. the history of the father\u2019s interaction with x can be summarised as follows: (a) the parties separated when x was one month old. at that time the father was living in city e and the mother in the region dd. the father visited x in the presence of the maternal grandparents at least weekly and sometimes twice each week. (b) in may 2018 an issue arose between the parties following the father\u2019s visit with x. shortly after this the father commenced proceedings in the newcastle registry. (c) the father had only limited interaction with x between may 2018 and march 2019 as he was living in country ee. it was noted that x became distressed when she first saw her father due to being unable to identify him, particularly after long periods of absence without contact. (d) in march 2019 the father attended at the mother\u2019s home unannounced seeking to see x. when the mother indicated that he could not spend time with x, he contacted the police who later conducted a welfare check. (e) on 9 may 2019 interim orders were made for the father to spend time with x at a supervised contact service, ff contact centre, two hours each week. the mother says that the father attended sporadically. (f) in august 2019 the father\u2019s time with x progressed to unsupervised time in three hour blocks. the mother raised some concerns about the father\u2019s care for x during these times. (g) during 2020 the father visited x on eight occasions. the mother also gave evidence about some concerns she had about the father\u2019s care of x during some of these visits. the parties separated when x was one month old. at that time the father was living in city e and the mother in the region dd. the father visited x in the presence of the maternal grandparents at least weekly and sometimes twice each week.

hearing the father had spent time with x on two occasions in 2021. he communicates with x regularly via videoconferencing although the mother has described this as \u201cinconsistent\u201d. 89 the mother argued that the father has voluntarily opted to remain absent for long periods of time without taking the opportunity to spend time or communicate with x. the father admitted that there were a range of factors that contributed to his availability to spend time with x. in 2019 he welcomed the arrival of a new child, f. he remarried and moved to tasmania in early 2020. for part of 2020 he was unable to visit nsw due to restrictions on travel arising from covid-19. he has been building a home in tasmania and establishing a business there. 90 the family consultant observed at [84] of the family report that: [i]f safe to do so, it would be in x\u2019s best interests if mr longer commit to spending time with her on a regular basis and ms longer support and facilitate this. this would ensure that the child/father emotional bond can be further strengthened, a lasting and meaning relationship nurtured, and a reliable and consistent parenting plan maintained, which would better support x\u2019s development, and likely provide ms longer with considerable reassurance. 91 the father was asked what time he realistically thought he could spend with x in future given his relocation to tasmania. he hoped to attend nsw more regularly and could commit to visiting x on the last weekend of each month. he was adamant that supervised time was unnecessary. 92 the mother argued that since their separation and throughout the course of these proceedings, \u201cthe parties have had significant and enduring conflict in their communication and have struggled to make shared and equal long-term decisions about the child and associated parenting arrangements\u201d.[14] 93 the mother has been constantly engaged with a range of services for x and has provided the father with reports and other information in relation to her diagnosis and treatment. in september 2020 the mother organised for the father to attend x\u2019s speech therapy session. 94 apart from the speech therapist, the father does not appear to have met with or spoken to any of x\u2019s therapists, educators or medical practitioners. of more concern, was the father\u2019s views about the gdd and asd diagnosis under cross-examination by counsel for the mother. while accepting both diagnoses and the substantial support x requires, he said that he had some doubts about the opinions expressed in the reports. he said that he had done his own research of reliable sources and was concerned that x\u2019s gdd and asd was possibly caused by abuse or trauma from within the mother\u2019s home. i find there was no evidence to support this and remain concerned that this response may inhibit the father\u2019s ability in the future to participate equally with the mother in making decisions about major long-term issues for x. 95 the mother and the icl both seek orders for sole parental responsibility to the mother and refer me to the family report and updated cic memorandum which gives clear and unequivocal support for such an order. not least because the conflictual relationship between the mother and father would make the sharing of parental responsibility challenging.[15] section 60cc(3)(ca) the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent\u2019s obligations to maintain the child 96 the father said that he pays the minimum amount of child support through the child support agency. presumably he also pays child support for his three older children from previous relationships. 97 at the time of the hearing he received government benefits and derived a small income from his work but anticipated that his income would increase to allow him more regular trips to nsw to see his four children who reside here including x. section 60cc(3)(e) the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child\u2019s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis 98 there is an obvious practical difficulty for the father in spending time with x. putting to one side covid-19 interruptions, there are difficulties created by both geography and circumstance. the father has a new, young family in rural tasmania and is establishing a life for them there. he accepts that x is unlikely to be able to travel to tasmania in school holidays to visit him, as her half siblings would. 99 the mother receives financial assistance from her parents as well as government benefits, and currently works two days per week. she is unlikely to be in a position to facilitate x spending time with the father in tasmania, even if it was considered to be in x\u2019s best interests. 100 the icl submits that due to the mother\u2019s limited means and the father\u2019s decision to move to tasmania, the father should continue to fund any travel costs associated with visiting and spending time with x. this is a reasonable proposition. section 60cc(3)(f) the capacity of:(i) each of the child\u2019s parents, and (ii) any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs 101 both parties challenged each other\u2019s capacity to provide for x\u2019s emotional and intellectual needs. the mother has demonstrated her capacity to meet x\u2019s needs in an exemplary manner and can only be congratulated for her focus and dedication. the father, while more absent from her life, says that his family \u201cbrings to the table other important attributes, such as professional education and culture.\u201d[16] 102 the mother has consistently demonstrated a responsible attitude to the responsibilities of parenthood. she has cared for and attended to x\u2019s needs, and ensured that she has a safe, stable and supportive home life. this is contrasted with the father who has had little involvement in x\u2019s emotional and intellectual development. 103 the mother submits that during her marriage with the father, he had little involvement in the care of his older children, and sought assistance from her to care for them. in this way, the mother says that she became largely responsible for the care of the father\u2019s older children when they spent time with him during the weekends. 104 i do not accept that the father has had little involvement in the care of his older children. he has sought to continue to be a significant figure in their lives, and in x\u2019s, notwithstanding his distance from them. indeed in his written submissions the father says that: [f]rom experience and observations of the emotional, psychological and developmental differences in my first 2 children and my third one, the more the court orders enable and encourage positive co-parenting, the better off x will be.[17] 105 the father raised concerns about the mental health of the mother and her parents. the mother receives counselling from her psychologist and does not experience any mental health issues that would impact her capacity to provide for the needs of the child. the mother has been proactive in taking steps to ensure that her own psychological needs are taken care of, so as to enable her to support and care for x. section 60cc(3)(i) the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents 106 these matters have been addressed above. section 60cc(3)(g) the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child\u2019s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant 107 x lives in a bilingual household. her grandmother was born in country gg and her grandfather in country hh. it is reported that she speaks more country v than english. 108 the father is of country b cultural background. his wife was born in country h and speaks country v. 109 he has four children from previous relationships. f is two and lives with him. he is expecting a new child to be born shortly. his other three children reside in the city e area with their mothers. when he travels to see x he also arranges to see and spend time with his other children. at [82] of the family report the family consultant stated that: x does have a right to experience relationships with other paternal family members, notably her half-siblings, and knowledge and information concerning her paternal history, customs, beliefs and traditions. these all inform important aspects of x\u2019s identity formation and self-concept. section 60cc(3)(j) any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family 110 while there are no previous or current family violence orders in relation to either parent or x, both parties make serious allegations against the other in respect to family violence as well as psychological, emotional and financial abuse. 111 the father alleges that he experienced family violence at the hands of the mother including: (a) in february 2016 in city e the mother forcibly pushed the father's head to one side when he was lying down. he became partially paralysed for some moments and has felt discomfort in the affected place for over a year. (b) in the first half of 2016, the mother pushed or punched the father in the solar plexus and other parts of body on multiple occasions. one such incident occurred in july 2016 in city jj. (c) on 24 december 2016 the mother bit the father\u2019s forearm. he emailed her a photo of the wound and she responded \u201cgood that\u2019s what i like to see.\u201d (d) shortly before 31 december 2016 the mother punched the father in his right arm. he emailed her a photo of the resulting bruise. (e) on 15 february 2017 in city e, the mother forced her fingernails into the father\u2019s left thigh causing minor bleeding and leaving a scar. (f) shortly before 24 february 2017 in town kk, the mother threw a car key hitting the father in the head. (g) on 7 may 2017 the mother called the father \u201casshole\u201d and \u201cdickhead\u201d in the presence of his children. he emailed her about it later. (h) on 31 may 2017, the mother called the father a \u201cpiece of shit\u201d, hit him and threw a chair in his direction. she later blamed him for her actions in an email. (i) while living in suburb d, the mother forcibly prevented the father from leaving a heated argument and he threatened to call the police. in february 2016 in city e the mother forcibly pushed the father's head to one side when he was lying down. he became partially paralysed for some moments and has felt discomfort in the affected place for over a year.

(i) while living in suburb d, the mother forcibly prevented the father from leaving a heated argument and he threatened to call the police. 112 ultimately the primary risk that is pressed by the father is that he was the victim of physical violence, and controlling and coercive conduct at the hands of the mother during the relationship. he says for example, that she prevented or discouraged him from spending time with his circle of friends during their marriage. on that basis, there is a risk that she may engage in similar conduct in future relationships, and in doing so may expose x to family violence. 113 the mother alleges that there was a pattern of behaviour and conduct by the father that was coercive and controlling or that caused her to be fearful. in support of this her evidence is that: (a) there was a power imbalance between the parties - she was young and na\u00efve when the relationship commenced and there was a 14 year age gap between them. (b) she experienced verbal and physical abuse at the hands of the father during the relationship. (c) he denigrated her and was disrespectful towards her family members and cultural background. (d) the father allegedly exerted control over her by: (i) controlling and monitoring all of her expenditure during the relationship, (ii) giving her directions on how she should dress and behave around other men, (iii) setting rules about her conduct and behaviour and employing biblical quotes to guide her behaviour, and (iv) threatening to have x removed from her care during the relationship, and continuing \u201cto wield this sword\u201d by the position he takes in these proceedings. there was a power imbalance between the parties - she was young and na\u00efve when the relationship commenced and there was a 14 year age gap between them.

(emphasis in original) 115 section 4(1ab) defines member of the family to include former spouses and former de facto partners. this means that the behaviour could constitute family violence whether directed to the child or grandparents or the parties. 116 section 4ab(2) gives, as an example of conduct that may constitute family violence, \u201cpreventing the family member from making or keeping connections with his or her family, friends or culture.\u201d however, such behaviour only becomes family violence where the quality of that conduct meets the description in s 4ab(1). 117 in illgen & yike [2018] famca 17 at [123]- [125] justice gill analysed the terms \u201ccoerces or controls\u201d in the following manner: 123. coerce is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as 1. to restrain or constrain by force, law or authority, force or compel, as to do something. 2. to compel by forcible action 124. control is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as: 1. to exercise restraint or direction over, dominate, command 125. the phrase \u2018coerces or controls\u2019 is expressed disjunctively. however it may be seen that the two concepts are closely related. together they form an expanded concept of the exercise of power, to restrain another or to cause another to act, by force, domination or command. 118 generally coercive control is understood as a course of conduct aimed at dominating and controlling another person. 119 even if we accept the father\u2019s evidence that there were occasions when the mother intentionally caused physical harm to him, and that his circle of friends diminished during the relationship, he needs to demonstrate that the mother\u2019s conduct caused a negative response in him (such as, that he felt compelled to take actions against his will or that he felt dominated by the mother or that she caused him to fear her). additionally he needs to demonstrate the mother\u2019s ability to control him. 120 the mother presented as softly spoken. her counsel asserted that when she entered the relationship with the father she was na\u00efve, sheltered, young and most likely impressionable. the father himself describes the mother as \u201can anxious person, emotional, excitable, relatively narrow minded and, at least during our relationship, quite immature and dependant on her parents\u201d.[18] the father\u2019s evidence fell well short of establishing coercive control on the part of the mother. 121 notably when the family consultant gave evidence, the father asked her to comment on his experience of family violence during the relationship and specifically his allegation that the mother had committed \u201cnine incidents of physical violence...along the lines of bites and bruising documented by photographs\u201d. she observed in response: [19] well, remarkably, bites, scratches and so on are very commonly identified on victim survivors of family violence. it\u2019s one of the things that is often used by perpetrators in a court. you know, they will very often admit to lower-impact crimes and very often claim that, you know, they\u2019ve been abused and evidence bites and scratches as evidence of that. so the reason i\u2019m saying that is that based on the mother\u2019s evidence, you can\u2019t discount that it has been in response to frustration, stress, angst, potentially, you known, anxiety, around her experience of you. 122 the father asks that i find the mother\u2019s allegations to be \u201cvague, generic accusations\u201d and that i should not accept her account of the family violence because she \u201cfailed to provide a single specific account of an actual abuse.\u201d indeed he criticised the mother for \u201cwielding the coercive and controlling victim card\u201d. 123 his submission and indeed the manner in which he conducted his case failed to appreciate the complex nature of coercive and controlling conduct and its impact. behaviour described as coercive and controlling is rarely a single incident, but rather a pattern of behaviour. 124 the family consultant supported this in the family report at [35] saying the mother \u201cdepicted a relationship in which she were subjected to dynamics of power, control, domination, sexual jealousy and insecurity, and an array of other psychological abusive tactics.\u201d 125 of the father\u2019s capacity to exert control and dominance the family consultant made a number of observations at [77] of the family report that would evidence that the father \u201chad an attitude of ownership and authority in the parental relationship.\u201d she concluded that \u201cconsiderable social science research indicates that a lot of the things mr longer has done meet the criteria for coercive, controlling family violence\u201d.[20] 126 while i have been unable to make findings on every incident alleged by the mother, i found her evidence on the issue was credible. she is supported by the opinion of the family consultant. i find that she experienced family violence in the relationship in the form of coercive and controlling behaviour. section 60cc(3)(l) \u2013 whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child 127 the avoidance of further litigation is a matter that counsel addressed me on. this is a difficult matter because of x\u2019s age and disabilities. not only are the long term implications for x unknown, i cannot be sure of the father\u2019s capacity to manage her behavioural challenges into the future, especially if he is unable to establish a regular and consistent pattern of spending time with her. 128 the mother seeks an order for the father\u2019s time to be supervised. the icl cautioned against me making a long term order for supervision. in all likelihood it would lead to further litigation. 129 the avoidance of further litigation also motivated the mother to seek orders with respect to obtaining a passport for x and undertaking travel outside the commonwealth of australia. section 60cc(3)(m) \u2013 any other fact or circumstances the court thinks is relevant 130 in his minute of order the father sought an order restraining the mother from changing x\u2019s name. this was the first time that the issue had been raised and there was no evidence led on the issue by either of the parties. for this reason i decline to make such an order. primary considerations meaningful relationship 131 section 60cc(2)(a) of the act requires me to consider the importance of x having a meaningful relationship with each of her parents. on the other hand, i must consider the issue of the risk associated with her being exposed to harm or abuse in the care of either of her parents. 132 in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92 at [122], the full court said: no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child's best interests. 133 in finton & kimble [2017] fcwa 106 at [37], justice walters said: the court is required to consider, as one of a large number of factors, the benefit to the child of having such a meaningful relationship. 134 in that decision, his honour referred to several other authorities, including the full court decision in jurchenko & foster [2014] famcafc 127 at [123] where the court noted that: ... having a \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child\u2019s best interests. 135 both parties accepted that x should have a meaningful relationship with the father. the challenge in this case is how this can be achieved in a manner that is in x\u2019s best interests and without risk. the law as it applies to cases about risk 136 in the case of deiter & deiter [2011] famcafc 82 at [61], the full court indicated that, in assessing risk i have to look at two elements: \u201cthe first requires prediction of the likelihood of the occurrence of harmful events, and the second requires consideration of the severity of the impact caused by those events.\u201d 137 in making a prediction of whether risk is likely to occur i need to be reasonably satisfied of it. as observed by justice dixon in briginshaw v briginshaw [1938] hca 34, (1938) 60 clr 336 at 362: ...reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. in such matters \u2018reasonable satisfaction\u2019 should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences. 138 more correctly, the approach is now contained in s 140(2) of the evidence act 1995 (cth) which is generally to the same effect and states: (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject\u2011matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged. 139 in newman & tate [2020] famca 1114 dcj mcclelland at [92] provides a useful summary of the full range of principles to be applied when determining whether an unacceptable risk, in terms of s 60cc(2)(b) of the act, exists. he observes: determining the issue of risk essentially involves applying a risk matrix whereby it is necessary to assess the potential seriousness of the harm in the context of the probability of its occurrence. that is, there is an obligation on a trial judge to evaluate, not only the extent, magnitude and nature of the harm that might befall the child if there is a future act of abuse or harmful conduct, but also to evaluate the prospect or probability of such an act or conduct occurring that would cause such harm to the child he also goes on to observe that: the court may reach a conclusion of \u2018unacceptable risk\u2019 from the accumulation of factors... 140 finally, having identified the existence of an unacceptable risk, it is then necessary for the court to assess whether that risk \u201cis able to be sufficiently managed or ameliorated\u201d: see blinko & blinko [2015] famcafc 146 at [83]. discussion of risk 141 there are risks alleged by each parent in this matter. 142 the father relies on multiple affidavits and his case outline document where he has at various times alleged a range of risks for x in the care of the mother including: (a) the paternal grandfather previously abused alcohol and was a \u201cviolent alcoholic\u201d. (b) the paternal grandfather is anxious and paranoid evidenced by his behaviour of padlocking the doors of his house at night. (c) the mother does not support his relationship with x. (d) the mother suffers from mental health issues, particularly anxiety which causes her to not support his relationship with x. the paternal grandfather previously abused alcohol and was a \u201cviolent alcoholic\u201d. (b) the paternal grandfather is anxious and paranoid evidenced by his behaviour of padlocking the doors of his house at night. (c) the mother does not support his relationship with x. (d) the mother suffers from mental health issues, particularly anxiety which causes her to not support his relationship with x. 143 however, by the time of the hearing and under cross-examination he took the following view as to the risks that each posed: (a) in relation to the allegations of past physical violence by the mother, he acknowledged that the last incident he referred to was over four years ago and not in x\u2019s presence, but noted that the mother has entered a new relationship and may have similar problems. (b) of the other risks referred to in the father\u2019s material he acknowledged that they are not as much of a concern now \u2013 he has never seen the maternal grandfather use alcohol and is not sure if he still padlocks the house at night. the father also conceded that in recent times his relationship with the mother has improved. (c) there was extensive evidence given about x\u2019s special needs and the various services and therapies she is engaged with both externally and in her home. the father conceded that she is well cared for by the mother and he has no current concerns about her safety and care. (d) he maintained that he was the victim of coercive and controlling behaviour at the hands of the mother during their relationship because she isolated him from his friends and caused physical harm to him during the relationship. as outlined earlier, having considered the evidence, there is no basis upon which i can make such a finding. in relation to the allegations of past physical violence by the mother, he acknowledged that the last incident he referred to was over four years ago and not in x\u2019s presence, but noted that the mother has entered a new relationship and may have similar problems. (b) of the other risks referred to in the father\u2019s material he acknowledged that they are not as much of a concern now \u2013 he has never seen the maternal grandfather use alcohol and is not sure if he still padlocks the house at night. the father also conceded that in recent times his relationship with the mother has improved. (c) there was extensive evidence given about x\u2019s special needs and the various services and therapies she is engaged with both externally and in her home. the father conceded that she is well cared for by the mother and he has no current concerns about her safety and care. (d) he maintained that he was the victim of coercive and controlling behaviour at the hands of the mother during their relationship because she isolated him from his friends and caused physical harm to him during the relationship. as outlined earlier, having considered the evidence, there is no basis upon which i can make such a finding. 144 at the commencement of the hearing the father proposed that if the court finds there are \u201cserious concerns for the child\u2019s safety and healthy development\u201d in the mother\u2019s household he is prepared for the court to make an order that x live with him. however as outlined earlier, the father ultimately conceded that x is well cared for by the mother and that he has no current concerns about her safety. 145 the court also has no concerns about x\u2019s care in the mother\u2019s household and does not accept that she is at risk of harm in the mother\u2019s household. 146 the mother alleges that: (a) the father has mental health issues and a personality dysfunction. (b) the father abuses alcohol and has an irresponsible and erratic driving style. (c) the father\u2019s lacks a protective instinct towards his other children. (d) there was a pattern of abuse and coercive control during the parties\u2019 marriage. (e) there is the potential for future psychological abuse of x due to his tendency towards prolonged periods of absence without contact. (f) the father has unacceptable views about and does not want x exposed to these. the father has mental health issues and a personality dysfunction. (b) the father abuses alcohol and has an irresponsible and erratic driving style. (c) the father\u2019s lacks a protective instinct towards his other children. (d) there was a pattern of abuse and coercive control during the parties\u2019 marriage. (e) there is the potential for future psychological abuse of x due to his tendency towards prolonged periods of absence without contact. (f) the father has unacceptable views about and does not want x exposed to these. 147 in the course of the hearing, other than the mother\u2019s affidavit evidence, no other evidence supported the assertion that father has a mental health issue that poses a risk to the child. 148 the mother conceded that she had seen the father under the influence of alcohol on two occasions and that she did not realistically press his alcohol consumption as a risk. nor was his irresponsible or erratic driving pressed as an ongoing risk. 149 the parties have different and contrasting attitudes to their responsibilities as parents. they bring different parenting styles to the upbringing of x. the mother is a cautious and anxious parent. by contrast, the father approaches parenting in a more relaxed manner. the mother is concerned about what she perceives is the father\u2019s lack of a protective instinct towards his other children but this is not pressed as an ongoing risk issue. 150 the father seems to have limited insight into this dynamic. the mother might have felt more secure had the father made enquiries with x\u2019s treating medical, allied health professionals and educators about her progress or had he sought assistance on strategies to manage her when in his care. but he has not. the mother might have felt more confident had the father acknowledged in his affidavit material or submissions the challenges that parenting x present now and into the future. he has not done this either. 151 however, the decisions that have to be made in this case go beyond parenting styles. they have to be grounded in the risks that are present and how, if at all, those risks can be mitigated. 152 the principal risks for x that emerged over the course of the hearing are: (a) whether the father\u2019s views about women and sexuality have the potential to place x at risk, (b) the risks arising from the coercive and controlling behaviour exhibited by the father, (c) the risk that the father\u2019s lack of frequency and consistency in visits causes psychological harm to x, and (d) the risk that the father cannot manage x. whether the father\u2019s views about women and sexuality have the potential to place x at risk, (b) the risks arising from the coercive and controlling behaviour exhibited by the father, (c) the risk that the father\u2019s lack of frequency and consistency in visits causes psychological harm to x, and (d) the risk that the father cannot manage x. 153 the mother in her affidavit material raised concerns that the father sexualises girls. whilst the father\u2019s recent preference for younger partners may support her concerns, i was not satisfied on the evidence, that the father\u2019s views about women and sexuality have the potential to place x at risk. 154 considerable evidence was led about the father\u2019s ability to have frequent and consistent visits with x and the risks that might arise if he is unable to do so. the family consultant at [84] of the family report observed that if it was safe to do so, it would be in x\u2019s best interests for the father to spend time with her on a regular basis as it would ensure \u201cthe child/father emotional bond can be further strengthened, a lasting and meaningful relationship nurtured, and a reliable and consistent parenting plan maintained, which would better support x\u2019s development...\u201d she also cautioned that if the father is unable to spend regular and consistent time with x this would \u201cpotentially cause x considerable confusion and stress in her relationship with him and, ultimately, she may become resistant to spending time with him entirely.\u201d 155 i note that the father has been consistent in his efforts to maintain and develop a relationship with x since her birth. whilst he might be criticised for putting the needs of himself above the needs of x, and in doing so failing to establish a consistent spend time with regime, i accept that he has been a consistent figure in her life. notwithstanding his six months in country ee, his travels around australia and his relocation to tasmania, he has continued to visit x and develop his relationship with her. this causes the family consultant to conclude at [82] of the family report that: [d]espite mr longer\u2019s limited time with x, it would appear that x is comfortable in his care and she has the foundations of a relationship with her father who has been involved in various parenting tasks during \u2018time\u2019 and appears to be invested in knowing and raising her. 156 provided he continues to speak with her on a regular basis and visit her in accordance with the orders, i am confident he will continue to nurture the relationship. 157 i have outlined extensively in this judgment the challenges that x faces. the family consultant considered them somewhat briefly when she undertook her report but her interviews took place prior to the most recent pecat assessment report being released. the icl and the father were of the view that there is no significant risk of the father being unable to manage x. it was argued that x\u2019s behavioural challenges and gdd were known to the court when interim orders were made for unsupervised time and there has been no significant change of circumstance since then. 158 i am not bound by decisions made on an interim basis. at a final hearing, the court has time to test the evidence. there are many more documents available via evidence gathering processes and we have had the opportunity to view documents tendered about x\u2019s development and engagement with other services. 159 i accept that the father has great experience as a parent to three other children. i also accept that on many occasions the father will be supported by his new wife and older teenage children when he spends time with x. however, i am concerned by the father\u2019s lack of engagement with the people involved in x\u2019s care, assessment and ongoing treatment and therapy who are all best placed to guide him on how to best manage x\u2019s behaviour and how to best support her treatment plans. 160 earlier i made a finding that the father engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour during the course of the relationship. the icl submitted that there is no evidence before the court that the father has engaged in controlling and coercive behaviour since the parties separated and therefore i cannot be reasonably satisfied that it remains a risk to x to the briginshaw standard. 161 counsel for the mother argued that the father has continued a course of coercive and controlling behaviour alleging that he: (a) had not taken up opportunities to have contact when orders were made in his favour. (b) has not taken up opportunity to communicate with x regularly. (c) demonises the mother and maternal grandmother and alleges risk with no evidence. (d) has spent no longer than four hours with x at any time. (e) does not take her special needs seriously. (f) has threatened to remove x from the mother\u2019s care, including in these proceedings. had not taken up opportunities to have contact when orders were made in his favour. (b) has not taken up opportunity to communicate with x regularly. (c) demonises the mother and maternal grandmother and alleges risk with no evidence. (d) has spent no longer than four hours with x at any time. (e) does not take her special needs seriously. (f) has threatened to remove x from the mother\u2019s care, including in these proceedings. 162 further, counsel for the mother submitted that people who engage in coercive and controlling behaviour do not suddenly stop and if i make a finding that it existed during the relationship, the mother and x remain at risk in the future. the family consultant took a similar view. when put to her that the mother was not maintaining an unacceptable risk case she opined that this may be a reflection of \u201cthe control she is experiencing\u201d. 163 when the family consultant was asked about the risks for the mother and x she said:[21] in family court proceedings, perpetrators of coercive, controlling family violence are particularly dangerous to mothers and children because their control extends well beyond separation, sometimes for years. they engage in patterns of behaviour that are designed to isolate, degrade, exploit and control victims and the mother\u2019s depictions of some of the father\u2019s behaviour would be considered text book in some of the things she has told me. 164 and:[22] ...[m]y fear with x and with her mother is that need to continue to control and have dominance and power over her will continue well beyond...today. without court orders that protect x and her mother, who has been her sole carer, primary carer and has been her primary source of love and nurturance and care her entire life, i think that it would be a very dire situation. 165 i have considered all of the arguments put forward by counsel for the mother and considered their cumulative effect. whilst i accept there is a risk that the father will continue to engage in behaviour that is coercive and controlling, i find the risk of this is low. the father since separation has continued to pursue his relationship with x both directly with the mother and via these court proceedings in a reasonably positive way. at the same time he has occupied himself with many other activities and in other countries and states. arguably he faces more criticism for his absence post separation than his presence. his lack of engagement with the mother about x or the medical professionals, therapists and educators might suggest that he is no longer engaged in a course of conduct aimed at dominating and controlling the mother. only time will tell, but in any event, whatever orders are made will need to mitigate against this risk. can the risks of psychological harm to x be mitigated? 166 i note that the father has been consistent in his efforts to maintain and develop a relationship with x since her birth. whilst he might be criticised for putting the needs of himself above the needs of x, and in doing so failing to establish a consistent spend time with regime, i accept that he has been a consistent figure in her life. notwithstanding his six months in country ee, his travels around australia and his relocation to tasmania, he has continued to visit x and develop his relationship with her. this causes the family consultant to conclude at [82] that: 167 provided he continues to speak with her on a regular basis and visit her in accordance with the orders, i am confident he will continue to nurture the relationship. 168 unfortunately due to the covid-19 pandemic, it may be many months before the father is able to spend physical time with x again. the father argues that his continued electronic communication with her will ensure that he is a familiar person in her life. even so, if the father were to spend time with x any orders would need to ensure that x was comfortable transitioning back to his care and separating from the mother. 169 during the hearing evidence was given about the need for the father to understand x\u2019s behaviour and manage it. also emphasised was the need for the father to spend time with x regularly and consistently. a familiar and consistent venue was also raised as being important to mitigate the risk of x becoming distressed or over stimulated. 170 the father is an intelligent man who will have no difficulty turning his mind to the assessment reports and recommendations made in them. the risks of psychological harm can be mitigated through the father being required to see x in a familiar environment, taking advice from her carers and treaters and containing his visits for periods of a short duration for now. 171 with a sensitive approach and regular visits by the father, i am of the view that the risks of psychological harm to x can be mitigated. 172 when the family consultant completed her interviews in july 2021 she concluded at [31] of the cic memorandum that if the court found merit in the mother\u2019s allegations of coercive controlling behaviour perpetrated against her by the father that it would not be appropriate that she be expected to have contact or communicate with him. the risks associated with this can be mitigated by ensuring that contact and communication between the parties is kept to a minimum. 173 counsel for the mother argued that the only way the risk of harm could be mitigated was by making an order for supervised time between x and the father. 174 the father has already been through a regime of supervised time. this time would have allowed both he and x to develop their relationship, and for the supervisor to raise any concerns about the appropriateness or otherwise of the father\u2019s behaviour. no concerns were raised. while the mother has expressed some reservations about the father\u2019s care of x on three unsupervised occasions, and i have considered the nature of her concerns, they had little to do with the fathers controlling and coercive behaviour \u2013 more his parenting style. 175 i have also considered the evidence of the family consultant. she did not support a long term order for supervision, nor an order for overnight time. 176 i am left concluding that the risks arising from family violence and the psychological harm identified can be mitigated by orders that: (a) avoid the parties having to make mutual decisions, (b) avoid the mother and father having to come face to face too often, (c) require the father to seek appropriate advice about managing x\u2019s behaviour and his time with her more generally before unsupervised time recommences, (d) ensure a consistent, familiar and appropriate venue for the father\u2019s time, and (e) limit the duration of the father\u2019s visits and do not increase the duration until endorsed by x\u2019s treating doctor or therapist. avoid the parties having to make mutual decisions, (b) avoid the mother and father having to come face to face too often, (c) require the father to seek appropriate advice about managing x\u2019s behaviour and his time with her more generally before unsupervised time recommences, (d) ensure a consistent, familiar and appropriate venue for the father\u2019s time, and (e) limit the duration of the father\u2019s visits and do not increase the duration until endorsed by x\u2019s treating doctor or therapist. conclusion as to orders parental responsibility 177 as the court is being asked to make orders as to parenting, the first question to be determined is whether the presumption in section 61da(1) of the act, that is, is it in the best interests of the child that the parents have equal shared parental responsibility, has been rebutted as: (a) there are reasonable grounds to believe a parent (or a person who lives with the parent) has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence (section 61da(2)) of the act, or (b) the proceedings are interim and the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order (section 61da(3)) of the act. there are reasonable grounds to believe a parent (or a person who lives with the parent) has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence (section 61da(2)) of the act, or (b) the proceedings are interim and the court considers that it would not be appropriate in the circumstances for the presumption to be applied when making that order (section 61da(3)) of the act. 178 as i have found that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the father has engaged in family violence, the presumption in section 61da(1) is rebutted. 179 pursuant to section 65dac of the act, an order for equal shared parental responsibility requires the parents to make together (and jointly) decisions about major long-term issues affecting the child. the father seeks an order to this effect. 180 the father\u2019s case is that the communications between the parties have much improved. 181 his view as reported by the family consultant at [23] of the cic memorandum is that: [t]he court making an order for the mother to have sole parental responsibility for x would be \u2018an easy way out for the legal system to cut fathers off when the mother is not willing to communicate\u2019, and that sole parental responsibility is \u2018fundamentally wrong\u2019. 182 the family consultant ultimately concluded at [31] of the cic memorandum that: [e]qual shared parental responsibility would not be appropriate for this family because there is conflict between the parents, who are unable to effectively communicate and problem solve together on x\u2019s behalf. there would be a risk that shared parental responsibility would expose x to conflict between her parents, which would not be in her best interests. also of significance, if the court determines that there is merit to the mother\u2019s allegations of coercive controlling behaviour perpetrated against her by the father, it would not be appropriate that she be expected to have contact or communicate with him. this is because she would likely experience this as immensely stressful and there would be a risk that such maternal stress would be transferred to x, which would not be in her best interests. further, x lives with the mother and spends minimal time with the father who does not appear to have been actively involved in her care to date. it would seem sensible that the mother have sole parental responsibility for x. 183 in cross-examination she confirmed her views on this had not changed. 184 i am satisfied that requiring the mother to communicate with the father in order to give effect to an order for the parents to have equal shared parental responsibility would cause her ongoing anxiety and may adversely impact upon her parenting capacity and, hence, not be in the best interests of x. 185 i have also reached this conclusion because x has high needs and requires constant involvement of medical and therapeutic services. it is not practical to require the mother to arrive at these decisions jointly with the father into the future. it is reasonable though for him to be advised of these matters and have the opportunity to speak to professionals involved in her treatment. i will make orders to facilitate this. what time should the father spend with x? 186 in m v m [988] hca 68 the high court at [20] observed that parenting proceedings are not to be viewed as adversarial proceedings in the ordinary sense, but as an investigation as to what order will best promote the welfare of the child. a court exercising jurisdiction under part vii of the act is not bound by the proposed orders of any party or limited to making orders in the terms sought by a party.[23] 187 for reasons that will be outlined, i will make orders for the father to spend time with x that have regard to the needs to mitigate the risks outlined previously. this means that the orders at times depart from the orders sought by the parties. 188 at [24] of the cic memorandum the father stated to the family consultant that: he seeks \u2018flexibility\u2019 in the court orders, because he lives a significant distance from the maternal residence. he said that he would like the court orders to reflect that he spend time with x \u2018when i\u2019m in new south wales and whenever i can\u2019. he said that he would like x to commence spending overnight time with him at times he is in new south wales, if the court determines this appropriate. he said that he understands that it would be necessary to consider x\u2019s age and stage of development, and whether she would be capable of managing same. [he] indicated that, in circumstances whereby x pined for her mother whilst spending overnight time with him, he would immediately return her to the maternal residence. 189 the mother says x needs a routine because children on the autism spectrum manage better with consistent and firm schedules. 190 the family consultant said at [27] of the cic memorandum that: a significant issue for x is the limited time she has spent with her father, notwithstanding that the covid-19 global pandemic has partly interfered with this. children need regular time with a parent in order to sustain a relationship. the reality is, x was one month old when her parents separated and she has not lived with her father since, nor spent meaningful and significant time with him. if the father is unable to commit to regular travel to x\u2019s domain (sydney), and spend time with her pursuant to court orders, x\u2019s relationship with him would possibly never develop to its full potential. 191 she went on to say at [30] that: it would be important that the father exercise caution and considerable patience concerning x commencing to spend overnight time with him. many children can manage one overnight with their non-live-with parent by the time they attain three years of age, but this is dependent on the child\u2019s personality and temperament, and their individual circumstances. it cannot be discounted that x would potentially experience spending overnight time in her father\u2019s care as stressful. this is because she has spent minimal time with him to date, and children on the autism spectrum are vulnerable to significant stress by way of altered routines and schedules. 192 having regard to those matters and to the special needs of x, i will make an order that she spend time with her father from 10am until 3pm on the last saturday of each calendar month. 193 having regard to the likely gap before the father can spend time with x again, before his first unsupervised visit, he will be required to visit x in a setting familiar to her, for example at either her home or at her day care facility (for example, ll childcare). the mother will nominate the setting. the father\u2019s attendance at this setting will establish trust with x but will also allow him to speak to her carers about managing x whilst she is in his care. when this suggestion was made during submissions the father expressed some reluctance - he viewed it as unnecessary. i listened to his concerns and whilst i accept he is not an unfamiliar person to x, in order to settle x and make it a positive experience for her i am of the view that a transition of this nature will be in her best interests. 194 the father will also be required to speak with one of the professionals currently engaged in x\u2019s treatment before his first unsupervised visit and seek advice on x\u2019s developmental needs and a suitable venue for his visits with her. she is currently under the care of a paediatrician, general practitioner, speech therapist, and the ll foundation. if the father is unable to arrange this, the mother will nominate to the father a suitable professional form him to speak with. 195 and upon seeking that advice and in considering any recommendations, the mother will confirm with him the regular venue he proposes to use consistently when he spends time with x. 196 i appreciate that the father seeks to enjoy much longer periods of time with x. i am aware that the icl, no doubt to avoid the need for further litigation, has recommended an incremental progression of the father\u2019s time with x from 9am until 5pm when x commences school. 197 due to x\u2019s medical and psychological needs it is difficult right now to assess her readiness for an increase in time in 18 months. even more so when we have no clear timeframe on when the father will be able to spend time with x again. i am prepared to extend the father\u2019s time by two hours each month such that it concludes at 5pm however such extension of time will not occur until the parties receive a recommendation in writing that supports x\u2019s capacity to tolerate the increase in time. again the mother will nominate to the father a suitable professional to make this assessment. 198 the icl proposed that the father also be permitted to spend time with x on the second saturday of each calendar month. when the father was asked about his intentions for the future he indicated that he could commit to a monthly visit and would only be likely to cancel or vary three or four of these each year. i am concerned that making the order proposed by the icl will create an expectation for x that she will see her father on a fortnightly basis when the likelihood of this seems improbable. it also requires more communication between the parties, something that the orders attempt to avoid due to the risk issues analysed above. the icl also proposed make up time for the father if he is unable to spend time with x in accordance with the orders. i declined to make this order for the reasons already outlined. 199 the parties did agree to a raft of orders concerning the ongoing communication and notification of matters concerning x. i will make those orders as proposed by the icl. removal from family law watchlist 200 the orders made on 26 august 2019 by judge boyle caused the child to be placed on the family law watchlist (formerly known as the airport watchlist) by virtue of the mother\u2019s fear that the father would remove x from australia as part of his continuous and ongoing travels abroad. 201 the father seeks to have x\u2019s name be removed from the watchlist. he advised the family consultant that he hopes to travel abroad with x and her half siblings in the future. he said that he has no intention of travelling interstate or abroad with x without her mother\u2019s knowledge and agreement. 202 the mother to seeks to travel abroad with x in the future but does not consent to the father doing so. 203 neither party appear to be a flight risk. both parties have well-established lives in australia. the suitability and practicality of x\u2019s travelling overseas in the future remains an unknown. having considered the evidence and submissions made on the issue i will order that x\u2019s name be removed from the watchlist and i will permit the mother to travel with x outside of australia for periods of no more than four weeks duration. 204 should the father in the future wish to travel abroad with x he will need to seek the mother\u2019s consent to do so. associate: dated: 1 november 2021 [1] father\u2019s case outline filed 29 july 2021 (\u201cfather\u2019s case outline\u201d).[2]affidavit of ms longer filed 28 july 2021, paragraphs 105-106.

judge o\u2019shannessy introduction background the proceedings interim proceedings the final hearing documents relied upon exhibits tendered applicable law standard of proof in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: the nature of the cause of action or defence, and the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and the gravity of the matters alleged. credit of the parties ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... [citations omitted] ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (\u201ccarlson\u201d) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case: [165] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... [169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide. [90] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to. 34 i acknowledge the wisdom of those observations. parenting family law act provisions major long\u2011term issues, in relation to a child, means issues about the care, welfare and development of the child of a long\u2011term nature and includes (but is not limited to) issues of that nature about: (a) the child\u2019s education (both current and future), and (b) the child\u2019s religious and cultural upbringing, and (c) the child\u2019s health, and (d) the child\u2019s name, and (e) changes to the child\u2019s living arrangements that make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with a parent. to avoid doubt, a decision by a parent of a child to form a relationship with a new partner is not, of itself, a major long\u2011term issue in relation to the child. however, the decision will involve a major long\u2011term issue if, for example, the relationship with the new partner involves the parent moving to another area and the move will make it significantly more difficult for the child to spend time with the other parent. ... 4ab definition of family violence etc. (1) for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person\u2019s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful.

the husband: i do. ms johnson: and so how many days a week would that be? you said it was once a month, but for what period of time? the husband: three days \u2013 three days of \u2013 three days without. monday \u2013 leave on a monday, fly back on a thursday. or drive and fly by. ms johnson: and that was on a sub-contracted basis from a [interstate]. is that correct? the husband: it is. ms johnson: all right. and you have a lot of other work, because you were quite respected in the industry. do you agree with that? the husband: i don\u2019t know. ms johnson: well, you\u2019re getting a lot of work generated, aren\u2019t you? you\u2019re busy? the husband: i \u2013 it\u2019s cyclical. yes. ms johnson: and it dropped back a little bit during 2020. would you agree with that \u2013 because of covid, and you couldn\u2019t do the fly in/fly out? the husband: i lost quite a lot of work, yes. ms johnson: yes. and i think it was in 2019 financial year, was that when you earned 166,000 in that year? the husband: 2019 to 2020, i think. ms johnson: okay. 166,000. yes, thank you? the husband: yes. ms johnson: and then \u2013 and the year prior to that it was 124,000? the husband: no, that\u2019s actually not true.[25] ... ms johnson: ... but, [the husband], in that, there\u2019s a report of [r consulting firm] and what they say is your taxable income in the 2019 year was 123,938. do you agree that that was the figure? the husband: yes. ms johnson: and in the 2019/2020 financial year, your taxable income was $161,717? yes. ms johnson: and it also goes on to say your net income from 1 july 2020 to 31 july \u2013 december 2020 was 66,185 \u2013 so that\u2019s a half year. you agree - - - ? the husband: yes, possibly. yes. ms johnson: right. okay. well, just going back to what i was putting to you was that you earn a considerable income, you\u2019re a high income earner. do you agree with that? the husband: one year.[26] the husband: ... it was just regarding the salaries on the two thousand and \u2013 my salary was quoted as 124,000 for 2018 to 2019. but there\u2019s 14,000 of long service leave on that which showed up in my bank account, so when i worked for [employer q], and then when you put the 10,000 into my super, it gives me an annual income of 100,000. so even though the sum showed by \u2013 by accountant then is 124, it was actually a taxable income of 100. his honour: in terms of recurring income? the husband: yes, because 14,000 was from my old employer as long service leave, and that was added onto that financial year. his honour: but you got it paid in cash? the husband: yes. just since \u2013 since the business \u2013 the \u2013 the \u2013 my \u2013 my premise of my business is that earn $100,000 a year, and the 161,000 was purely because of the death on [work site] where i flew up to [the site] on a weekly basis for a period of time to [perform work duties] to 300 [employees]. so what that saw me was attending the [work site] on a weekly basis for a couple of months, and then it dropped down to monthly, which brings my salary back to 100,000. so my actual salary of four years of being self-employed, three have been 100,000, and one has been 161. his honour: and the 161 was the \u2013 when you had the weekly basis instead of the monthly basis? the husband: in \u2013 in 2019.[27] the husband: so my question is what \u2013 so i will make the statement. my income for 2021 was actually $100,850.[28] his honour: was it is what you mean. do you - - - the husband: yes, yes, your honour. his honour: do you agree that was - - - the husband: do you \u2013 yes. his honour: - - - my income. the husband: yes, yes. do you agree that that was my income? the wife: yes. and i can see now there might be a date error. the husband: so in your affidavit - - -? the wife: - - - \u201920. the husband: in your affidavit the \u2013 in your affidavit you\u2019ve said my income 2020 to 2021. you actually contacted the child support agency at the end of 2021 to give them that information, didn\u2019t you? the wife: i don\u2019t recall when i contacted them. however, it is a really confusing system and i think they work on a year behind. i\u2019m \u2013 i\u2019m not sure but, you know, i agree that i can see your tax return here is \u2013 it\u2019s just over 100,000. the husband: so in your affidavit dated \u2013 and i\u2019ve got the numbers \u2013 so i want to go to her affidavit dated \u2013 i think it was february 2021. in that affidavit you claim that i had an income of $200,000 a year. that\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it? the wife: yes.[29] the husband: ... and, just jumping back onto the salary, the $160,000 that i earned in one year, one year alone - - - his honour: yes. the husband: - - - was purely based on that one time of a death on [work site] where i was able to fly out for 10 consecutive weeks, which gave me a huge amount of income for one year. i supplied my tax returns to this court. my average salary is $100,000. i earned $100,000 last year. my current salary is $100,000. my earnings is $100,000, and i work full time for that. not only do i work full time, i\u2019m also able to cater for the girls in the time that i work, which again is opposite to what my former partner says. ...[30] the wife's income the husband: and you also claim [in february 2021] that your salary was $39,000 a year. that\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it? the wife: yes. and if you look at my notice of assessment. ... the husband: so working for a not-for-profit organisation you have an annual salary that differs from your taxable salary. that\u2019s correct, isn\u2019t it? the wife: well, it \u2013 yes. so when you \u2013 when you put in deduction ..... you\u2019re - - - the husband: okay. so but it\u2019s different. your actual salary ... at that time was $55,000 a year, wasn\u2019t it? the wife: what year? sorry. what year are we talking about? the husband: in 2020. when you \u2013 2021 when you submitted your affidavit that you earned $39,000. ... the wife: that was based ... on my tax return.[31] ... his honour: before you do \u2013 yes. before you do because i think you\u2019re going to a different topic i just want to clarify. [the wife], being a not-for-profit \u2013 and i think what\u2019s being suggested is that you are able to salary sacrifice. is that the case? that you\u2019re able to salary sacrifice? the wife: i can do. yes. his honour: yes. and as at february 2021 were you salary sacrificing any of your income? yes. his honour: thank you. and as of now are you salary sacrificing any of your income? the wife: no. his honour: when did that change? the wife: last year.[32] ... the husband: so, your honour, if the \u2013 so my question relates back to the financial motivation. if i was to receive an increase in the care of the children it wouldn\u2019t be cost effective for [the wife] to return to work, more hours, because she wouldn\u2019t actually have as much money if she returned to work. so i\u2019m re-putting that question that to reduce the number of time the children spend with dad is financially motivated? the wife: that\u2019s not true. i\u2019ve already answered that.[33] expert evidence: the family report interview with [the husband] [the husband] gave an overview of the relationship and post-separation period from his perspective and consistent with his affidavit material. his mood and affect were well-modulated and within a normal range. [the husband] categorically denies the allegations of family violence and alleges [the wife] has been deceptive around her narrative on the financial issues to maximise her share of the settlement. ... [the husband] categorically denies the allegations of coercive and controlling family violence and financial abuse. he informed the writer that [the wife] had unilateral access to her income, and he consistently put a minimum of $2000 a fortnight in their joint account, and sometimes more. [the husband] referred the writer to his affidavit filed 22 april 2021 (paragraphs 15-25). in summary, he describes himself as the sole contributor to their joint account in which he deposited approximately $2000 a fortnight, and sometimes more. he expressed concern about [the wife\u2019s] spending and alleged gambling and believes that the bank statements support his narrative around this issue. as stated previously, [the husband] alleges that [the wife] allegations are designed to maximise her share of the settlement. ... as with [the wife], [the husband] believes that much of the parental conflict was encapsulated, and the children's exposure to the arguing and fighting was limited. he described agreeing to five nights a fortnight on the basis the arrangements would eventually move to a shared care structure. [the husband] notes that the post-separation relationship has been volatile from the outset but deteriorated significantly after the introduction of holiday time. he alleges [the wife] has been uncommunicative and uncooperative since october 2020, which coincides with the beginning of her new relationship. concerning [the wife\u2019s] intervention order, he categorically denies the allegations, which he described as vexatious and a strategic move by [the wife] to limit his time with the children. [the husband] described the children asking for more time with him in the early post-separation period. he acknowledges telling the children he was \u201cfighting for more time\u201d when they asked and, in retrospect, accepts that he should have been more circumspect. however, he categorically denies pressuring or influencing the children around their wishes in the matter. [the husband] informed the writer he continues to work on a fly-in- fly-out basis three days a month, and he does not perceive this as a restraint to a shared care arrangement. he is of the view the children will be psychologically and emotionally disadvantaged if denied an equal time relationship with him. the children and their relationships interview with [x] (aged seven) [x] was readily engaged but a little guarded and defended around the issue of spending time and parental roles. her mood and affect were appropriately labile and within a normal range. concerning her attendance at the assessment, she informed the writer, \u201cwe\u2019ve come because mum and dad can\u2019t be happy. my dad wants to have equal amounts of days, but my mum doesn\u2019t. dad talked about it this morning\u201d. ... [x] perceives herself as having adjusted reasonably well to the spending time arrangements. however, she notes that [y] struggled during holiday time with their father and had missed her mother. [x] explained that facetime with her mother had alleviated her anxiety about not seeing her during this extended period, and both parents were flexible around facetime contact. unprompted, [x] added that she also misses her father a lot. [x\u2019s] projective questioning, particularly around her interpersonal needs such as help with problem-solving, day-to-day caregiving, insight into her emotional life, social and domestic organisation, and knowledge about her friendships, identifies [the wife] as the primary attachment relationship. however, the writer gained the impression that [x] sensed her answers were skewed towards her mother and, unprompted, stated, \u201ci want equal time with my parents because i miss them both a lot when i\u2019m not with them. dad thinks it would be fair, it should be fair. i sometimes worry dad gets sad because it\u2019s not fair\u201d. [x] reports that [y] cries a lot when they talk about the spending time arrangements and would like her parents to reconcile. [x] appeared to become distracted and fatigued when the writer tried to discuss the pros and cons of various arrangements, and she struggled to conceptualise her father\u2019s proposal. the writer returned [x] to the waiting room when it became apparent she had reached her threshold for concentration with this part of the assessment. interview with [y] (aged six) [y] was readily engaged but somewhat defended and cautious when answering questions concerning the spending time arrangements. her mood and affect were appropriately labile and within a normal range. [y] understood the assessment to be about her parent\u2019s separation and the spending time arrangements and stated, \u201cwe\u2019ve come because my parents have split up. my dad wants equal time. i want seven days with mum and seven days with dad\u201d. ... [y] has limited memories of family life and reports her parents argued a lot, but they were mostly a happy family. she described feeling sad and upset about her parent's separation and stated, \"dad says he\u2019s fighting mum because he wants more days, and if it's not equal time, it's not fair\u201d. [y] reports feeling homesick and missing her mother on the recent holidays. however, she was able to facetime her mother and felt better afterwards. [y] explained that both parents allow facetime communication when they ask, which makes the absences easier. [y] was somewhat defended and cautious around her responses to projective questioning and questions of proximity and intimacy. she initially stated, \u201cthe parent that knows me best is my mum because i came out of her tummy\u201d. however, [y] became cautious and defended and appeared to be concerned about balancing her answers evenly between the parties. [y] did note that when she is anxious, she sleeps with [the wife], and her mother and sister know her moods and feelings the best. ... conjoint interview with both children the writer brought the children together to assess the sibling bond and test the consistency of their narratives. the children share a warm and reciprocated relationship. they described worrying about the possibility of being separated from each other as a result of the parental separation. while both children cautiously acknowledged their mother's primary caregiver role, they are concerned that the arrangements are fair for both parents. the children harbour no perceptions of fault with either parent concerning the parental separation, and [x] stated, \u201ci think they like each other as friends\u201d. observation of [the husband] with the children the children were brought to the playroom for observation with [the husband]. they separated from their mother without any sign of anxiety or apprehension. [the husband] quickly settled the children to play around the table with a game, and there was laughter and excitement around the surprise elements of the game. [y] was particularly affectionate with her father, sitting between his legs and seeking his attention. [the husband] was able to divide his time between the children in a skilled and equitable manner, and his interactions were pitched at a developmentally appropriate level. there is a warm and affectionate rapport between [the husband] and the children, who were relaxed and at ease in his care. ... the conduct of both parties throughout the assessment was exemplary, and they both impressed as skilled and intuitive parents. the parties' presentation is consistent with their view that the children's exposure to the parental conflict has been limited. ... prima facie, the accounts of the parties, when deconstructed, describe a relationship in long-term decline from before the birth of the children. there was an inability to acknowledge or understand the needs of each other, and a grumbling dissatisfaction and mutual antipathy were contained within the day-to-day functions and chores of family life. the behaviour of both parties in these circumstances closely aligns with the paradigm of \u201ccommon couple conflict\u201d. ... the children\u2019s engagement around the concept of fairness and equal time is consistent with them entering the developmental phase of \u201cconcrete functioning\u201d (ages 6-7). in this phase, they are able to integrate the experience of sharing with the concept of fairness (inductive reasoning). triggered by their father\u2019s narrative and their sense of loss around the parental separation, they perceive an equal time structure as the obvious solution to the parental dispute. this reductive logic does not account for the more complex developmental and psychological issues concerning the children's attachment needs, their adjustment to the separation, and their overall readiness for this type of arrangement. in this context, the writer's view is that the children's wishes in the matter are an unreliable guide to their best interest in the current circumstances. [the husband\u2019s] proposal for [an equal] shared care arrangement is assessed in the context of the parties\u2019 capacity to cooperate and communicate effectively around this type of arrangement. the literature on shared care describes the prerequisite conditions for optimal outcomes with this type of structure as, a high level of constructive communication and problem-solving, alignment of parenting values, a commitment by both parents to the concept, and an absence of conflict. ... it is the writer's view that the parties' communication and cooperation is not at the sophisticated and mature levels required for optimal outcomes with this type of arrangement. in these circumstances, an equal time arrangement is contraindicated and not recommended to the court. however, if the parties can settle into a rhythm and routine around the care of the children, it should not be ruled out in the future. the parties\u2019 should consider a review of the arrangements towards the end of the school year in 2022. this would allow the children to mature into their current developmental phase and provide for the post-separation relationship to improve from its existing low base. as stated previously, the parties have worked hard during the relationship to protect the children from the worst aspects of the parental conflict. these boundaries have become somewhat porous in the post-separation period. the children\u2019s current triangulation into the dispute presents as the most significant risk to their psychological and emotional welfare at this point in time. the current arrangements serve to consolidate the children\u2019s primary attachment needs with [the wife] while providing substantial time to maintain their relationship with [the husband]. this division and structure of time provides a stable platform for the children at this critical period in their adjustment to the separation. the parties should understand that children's adjustment to parental separation is largely dependent on the adult adjustment. the formula is simple, the more constructive and positive the adult adjustment, in the absence of conflict, the better the psychological and emotional outcomes for the child. recommendations the parties to have equal shared parental responsibility. the children to live with [the wife]. [the husband] to spend term time with the children, each alternate weekend from the conclusion of school on friday until the commencement of school on monday, and each alternate week from the conclusion of school on wednesday until the commencement of school on friday. [the husband] to spend holiday time with the children for half of all school holidays with the long summer break taken on a week about basis. the parent that has the children on the weekend following the last day of the school term to have the first week of the holidays. all milestones and days of celebration as per customary practice in these matters. in the event the one or other of the parties is unable to care for the children overnight, the party without the children to have first right of refusal to care for them. telephone and facetime contact as agreed between the parties. the parties to communicate with each other via a cloud-based app such as mymob.com or talkingparents.com. changeover as agreed between the parties. the parties to keep each other informed of any medical emergencies pertaining to the children in a prompt and timely fashion. the parties undertake to cease and desist from denigrating each other within earshot of the children. [emphasis added] the parenting issues in dispute ms johnson: i\u2019ve obtained instructions from the mother, given the evidence that has been given, and she seeks a four/10 arrangement, which would

and that it\u2019s good for them to spend time with him but she does think that the five/nine arrangement is excessive, but that a four/10 arrangement would be more in the children\u2019s best interests. section 60cc factors primary considerations meaningful relationship with both of the children\u2019s parents the need to protect children from physical or psychological harm additional

party. stanford ] in many cases where an application is made for property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice by made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife. no less importantly, the express implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship... and the assumption that any adjustment of those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4) (and/or section 90sm(3)). ] ...the fundamental propositions that have been identified require a court have a principled reason for interfering with the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties to the marriage and whatever may have been their stated or unstated assumptions and agreements about property interest during the continuance of the marriage.

is that there is no principle or guideline (or, indeed, anything else emerging from s 79), that renders the direct contribution of income or capital more important \u2013 or \u201cspecial\u201d \u2013 when compared against indirect contributions and, in particular, contributions to the home or the welfare of the family. ] if it is necessary to make the point again, and to highlight it for the purpose of this appeal, we add our endorsement to what has been made clear in the authorities referred and to the full court\u2019s comments in [52] of hoffman, that the words of s 79 do not provide endorsement for any category of contribution related to any class of property (for example, high wealth) being, by virtue of that category or class, more valuable or important that another. in each case the contributions made by the parties must be evaluated in the context of the facts particular to that case. dickons ] there can be little doubt that the classification of contributions by reference to terms such as \u201cinitial contributions\u201d, \u201ccontributions during the relationship\u201d, and \u201cpost-separation contributions\u201d, can be helpful as a convenient means of giving coherent expression to the evidence in a s 79 case and to giving coherence to the nature, form and extent of the parties\u2019 respective contributions. however, the task of assessing contributions is holistic and but part of a yet further holistic determination of what orders, if any, represent justice and equity in the particular circumstances of this particular relationship. so much is clear from the terms of s 79 itself and, in particular, s 79(2). the essential task is to assess the nature, form and extent of the contributions of all types made by each of the parties within the context of an analysis of their particular relationship. ... hurst ] the direct financial contribution of the suburb c property by the husband some 14 years before trial is, of course, a significant direct financial contribution weighing in his favour (s 79(4)(a)) and her honour correctly so found. but, as the authorities earlier cited make clear, a separate question within the assessment of contributions is, relevantly, the contributions made by both parties indirectly other than financially (s 79(4)(b)) and contributions to the welfare of the family including in the capacity of homemaker and parent (s 79(4)(c)). ... lovine & connor ] contribution, either direct or indirect and financial or non-financial, to any of acquisition and/or conservation and/or improvement to property (whether or not such property has ceased to be held) or to the welfare of the family or children, falls for consideration. no order of priority is attached to individual elements. the evaluation occurs often, as in this case, with respect to such disparate kinds of contribution made over a substantial period. such evaluation, having regard to its subject matter, inevitably involves value judgments and matters of impression. [41] it follows that the assessment involves matters of estimation and is not, and cannot be, a mathematical exercise. no amount of devotion to mathematics is capable of transforming a discretionary exercise involving many component parts, each mostly unamenable to precise computation, into one of aggregating separately finely calculated components to reach an overall outcome. [42] as part of the process of ultimately determining just and equitable orders under s 79 there is included a complex of discretionary assessments and judgments of many components of contribution, only some of which are capable of measurement in money terms and then often only in historical, rather than present, money terms. any dictate to the effect that in the course of assessment each disparate component part or kind of contribution must be assigned a discrete and identifiable value or percentage is antithetical to the nature of the discretion involved. ] it follows that the assessment involves matters of estimation and is not, and cannot be, a mathematical exercise. no amount of devotion to mathematics is capable of transforming a discretionary exercise involving many component parts, each mostly unamenable to precise computation, into one of aggregating separately finely calculated components to reach an overall outcome.

[36] that principle has a counterpart in the application factors prescribed in section 75(2) or section 90sm(3) of the act. any adjustment to the parties contribution-based- entitlements should be determined inclusively after considering all relevant factors, not by aggregating incremental adjustment in respect of each relevant factor. ] that principle has a counterpart in the application factors prescribed in section 75(2) or section 90sm(3) of the act. any adjustment to the parties contribution-based- entitlements should be determined inclusively after considering all relevant factors, not by aggregating incremental adjustment in respect of each relevant factor. tations omitted] the length of the marriage can be seen to be of considerable importance in the assessment of contributions. step three: section 75(2) factors ...in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue. on our adjusted figure for the value of the parties net assets ($1,503,863), adjustment of 10% in the wife\u2019s favour results in an increase in her entitlement of $150,386, and a corresponding reduction in the husband\u2019s entitlement, producing a differential movement between them of $300,772 ... 7] it is also important to recall what was said in phipson & phipson [2009] famcafc 28 when the full court was dealing with another appeal from the trial judge in the present proceedings: ] it is always important to keep in mind that an adjustment of x% for s 75(2) factors leads to a disparity in the value of property received by the parties representing 2 x x%. it is that disparity, measured in \u201cmoney terms\u201d, that requires consideration in determining whether the result is just and equitable: see campbell v kuskey [1998] famca 10, (1998) flc 92-795 at 84,928. 8] the 10% adjustment his honour made on account of s 75(2) factors has led to a disparity in favour of the wife equivalent in value to 20% of the assets. in money terms this represents $187,733 out of a total asset pool of $938,665. apart from the issues associated with the care, accommodation and maintenance of the children, the s 75(2) factors largely balanced out (save that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife would have more capital than the husband). the husband was going to have whatever responsibility remained for the care, accommodation and maintenance of j. both parties would have significant responsibility for the two younger children. it is true the wife will have the children with her about 20% more of the time than the husband, but this amounts to only a little more than 70 additional days a year. [109] in our view an assessment leading to a disparity of $187,733 in the capital/superannuation to be received by each party was outside the reasonable ambit of the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion, even taking into account the matters found by his honour relating to the non-payment of child support in the period after the husband gave up his employment. our conclusion is sufficient to enliven appellate intervention (house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513). the appeal will therefore be allowed. 9] in our view an assessment leading to a disparity of $187,733 in the capital/superannuation to be received by each party was outside the reasonable ambit of the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion, even taking into account the matters found by his honour relating to the non-payment of child support in the period after the husband gave up his employment. our conclusion is sufficient to enliven appellate intervention (house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513). the appeal will therefore be allowed. ... 2] in our view, given that the children will be with him around 40% of the time, the husband\u2019s accommodation needs for the children would not be significantly different to those of the wife. however, in light of the agreement in relation to child support, we accept that the wife will bear the greater proportion of the burden of maintaining the two younger children (at least for the time being). the husband, on the other hand, will have whatever responsibility remains for accommodating and maintaining j. the other s 75(2) factors, in our view, are evenly balanced, save for the fact that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife will have 4% (or $37,546) more of the assets/superannuation than the husband. [113] taking these matters into account, and the failure of the husband to pay child support after giving up his employment, we consider there should be a 4% adjustment for s 75(2) factors, creating a disparity of 8% between the parties \u2013 or in money terms an amount of $75,093. 3] taking these matters into account, and the failure of the husband to pay child support after giving up his employment, we consider there should be a 4% adjustment for s 75(2) factors, creating a disparity of 8% between the parties \u2013 or in money terms an amount of $75,093. 9] in our view, s 79(4)(e) requires those matters to be taken into account in arriving at orders that are just and equitable as between the parties. in arriving at an appropriate assessment for those factors, a dollar value of it should be uppermost in our minds [79] and, of course, the ultimate disparity in entitlements which it might produce. that dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests in property of the parties. discussion of the factors age and state of health income, property, financial resources and capacity for employment care of children under 18 years commitments of each of the parties to support themselves or a child responsibilities of either party to support any other person pension or benefit reasonable standard of living would maintenance assist education or training effect on creditors effect party contributed to the earning capacity and property of the other protect parties role as a parent whether party cohabiting with another person child support to be provided any fact or circumstances required to take into account conclusion as to section 75(2) adjustment step four: just and equitable and conclusion conclusions and calculations as to property matters associate: dated: 26 may 2023 dated: 26 may 2023 [1] although not relied upon in either parties list of documents the husband was cross examined about this document on 4 february 2022 at tp 102.[2] wife cross examined upon on these paragraphs on 18 february 2022 at tp 241-242.[3] see blass & blass [2022] fedcfamc1a 63; (2022) flc 94-085; (2022) 64 fam lr 625 (\u2018blass\u2019) at [40] & [41].[4] the wife\u2019s outline of case page 3 of 8.[5] wife\u2019s opening 3 feb 2022 tp 37 line 35.[6] by inference from wife\u2019s trial affidavit at [28], \u201c...the husband had $130,000\u201d.

morning [mr carron], we refer to the above appeal and note that the matter has been brought on for mention on 5 november 2019. we confirm that there is no utility in proceeding with the appeal in circumstances where the orders for costs in relation to judge egan\u2019s orders are redundant. kindly file and serve your notice of discontinuance as a priority. in circumstances where you fail, neglect or refuse to discontinue the proceedings and we are required to attend by telephone on 5 november 2019, we are instructed to seek a costs order be made against you on an indemnity basis and we shall rely upon this email in respect of same. we trust common sense will prevail in these circumstances. we look forward to receiving your filed notice of discontinuance by the close of business today. kind regards [ms d] friday, 1 november 2019 1:18 pm [dear ms d] in order to provide certainty in this matter, please provide written confirmation that your client agrees to jointly request that the costs order dated 4 december 2019 [sic] be set aside as part of the proceedings currently being heard by her honour judge turner. once that is received, a notice of discontinuance will be filed. yours faithfully [mr carron] friday, 1 november 2019 14:29:07 aest [hi mr carron], for clarity, our client is seeking that judge turner make a costs order against you on an indemnity basis and we are instructed to file an application for costs as directed by judge turner yesterday once the matter has been finally determined. the orders made by judge egan are no longer relevant and should you not discontinue your appeal in relation to the orders made by judge egan then we shall submit to [the registrar] that your intention is simply to inflate our client\u2019s legal fees. where [the registrar] is unwilling to make that costs order, we shall bring it to judge turner\u2019s attention in our application for costs as discussed above. we hope this clears up any confusion you may have with respect to our client\u2019s position on costs.\u201d kind regards [ms d] friday, 1 november 2019 3:04 pm i refer to [the registrar\u2019s] letter dated 31 october 2019 where she states there has been no advice as to \u201cwhether the parties have reached an accommodation which will enable this appeal to be discontinued\u201d. i also note that the costs order was stayed pending the outcome of appeal no 117/2018. discontinuing that appeal would remove that stay. i have been advised that your client\u2019s response is unclear in regards to the existing order and that discontinuing the appeal without reaching an accommodation would be unwise. in order to facilitate a resolution to the matter i state that my understanding from your response is that your client will not be pursuing enforcement of that order and will be seeking a new costs order. please advise if this is incorrect. failure to respond by 5pm today will taken [sic] as your client\u2019s acceptance of this understanding and i will file a notice of discontinuance accordingly. yours faithfully [mr carron] 01/11/2019 15:06 [hi mr carron], our client will not be pursuing the order made by judge egan in

wife is seeking indemnity costs from the commencement of her initiating application in september 2016 for both parenting and property matters. [23] i find that a costs order already exists as to the property proceedings up to and including the first property hearing as a costs order was made by judge egan in december 2018.

(2) the party may, within 14 days after receiving the costs assessment order, apply to have it set aside. note: if a party wishes to object to a costs assessment order after an assessment hearing has taken place, the party must do so in accordance with part 12.9. promissory estoppel certainly extends to representations (or promises) as to future conduct... in principle there is certainly no reason why the doctrine should not apply so as to preclude departure by a person from a representation that he will not enforce a non-contractual right... true it is that in the orthodox case of promissory estoppel, where the promisor promises that he will not exercise or enforce an existing right, the elements of reliance and detriment attract equitable intervention on the basis that it is unconscionable for the promisor to depart from his promise, if to do so will result in detriment to the promisee. none the less the proposition, by making the enforcement of the promise conditional on (a) a reasonable expectation on the part of the promisor that his promise will induce action or forbearance by the promisee and (b) the impossibility of avoiding injustice by other means, makes it clear that the promise is enforced in circumstances where departure from it is unconscionable. one may therefore discern in the cases a common thread which links them together, namely, the principle that equity will come to the relief of a plaintiff who has acted to his detriment on the basis of a basic assumption in relation to which the other party to the transaction has \u201cplayed such a part in the adoption of the assumption that it would be unfair or unjust if he were left free to ignore it\u201d: per dixon j. in grundt [(1937) 59 clr at 675], see also thompson [(1933) 49 clr at 547]. equity comes to the relief of such a plaintiff on the footing that it would be unconscionable conduct on the part of the other party to ignore the assumption. an equitable estoppel is binding in conscience on the party estopped, and it is to be satisfied by that party doing or abstaining from doing something in order to prevent detriment to the party raising the estoppel which that party would otherwise suffer by having acted or abstained from acting in reliance on the assumption or expectation which he has been induced to adopt. perhaps equitable estoppel is more accurately described as an equity created by estoppel. that brings me to estoppel, a label which covers a complex array of rules spanning various categories. there are divisions between common law and equitable estoppel, between estoppel by conduct and estoppel by representation, and the distinction between present and future fact. there are titles such as promissory estoppel, propriety estoppel, and estoppel by acquiescence. yet all of these categories and distinctions are intended to serve the same fundamental purpose, namely \u201cprotection against the detriment which would flow from a party's change of position if the assumption (or expectation) that led to it were deserted\u201d: waltons stores [(1988) 164 clr at 419], per brennan j. see also per mason cj and wilson j [(1988) 164 clr at 404], grundt [(1937) 59 clr at 674 675]. the result is it should be accepted that there is but one doctrine of estoppel, which provides that a court of common law or equity may do what is required, but not more, to prevent a person who has relied upon an assumption as to a present, past or future state of affairs (including a legal state of affairs), which assumption the party estopped has induced him to hold, from suffering detriment in reliance upon the assumption as a result of the denial of its correctness. a central element of that doctrine is that there must be proportionality between the remedy and the detriment which is its purpose to avoid. associate: dated: 30 may 2023 dated: 30 may 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "981.txt", "size": 28894, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 29166, "document_id": "981"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "981_chunk_0"}}

(ii) ms f placed the initials jp after her signature. (iii) subsequent enquiries by the wife revealed that that at the time the document was witnessed by ms f, ms f\u2019s appointment as a justice of the peace had expired. (iv) it is not a requirement of the legislation that the financial agreement, in order for it to be binding, is sworn or affirmed or needs the signature of a jp. (v) as is the common law practice, provided the signature to a deed is witnessed by an adult (someone over the age of 18) then there is no issue as to who can witness a signature.

(vi) subsequent to the appointment the wife chose to use the services of d lawyers in the preparation of the financial agreement and the husband chose to use mr e from e lawyers as his legal representative. (vii) i find that at no time did d lawyers act for both parties in the same or related matters and therefore this is not a matter where reg 11 legal profession uniform law australian solicitors\u2019 conduct rules (nsw) applies. (viii) likewise the decision of rees j in bachman & donohoe [2021] fedcfamc1f 240 is also not applicable. in that matter where it was held that independent legal advice had not been given, it was clear that the lawyer was involved with one of the parties (as a friend and part owner of a boat), had acted for one party in the preparation of a will, had given advice to both parties in respect to a property transfer and refinance, had subsequently given legal advice to both parties resulting in the drafting of a financial agreement and it was only shortly before signing that financial agreement that one of the parties was referred to another lawyer for independent advice. this is a very different fact scenario to this matter where the lawyer did not know the parties, had not acted previously for the parties, the joint appointment was information sharing and gathering only and that after the appointment and prior to the preparation of the agreement the wife had chosen d lawyers to retain as her lawyer and the husband had chosen e lawyers as his lawyers.

(xi) i therefore find that the husband had never been in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers about the financial agreement and therefore there was no conflict in d lawyers acting for the wife in respect to the financial agreement. (b) the wife did receive independent legal advice in respect to the financial agreement (i) the wife does not dispute that she was in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers but denies that such advice was independent. (ii) the parties had been in discussion about having a financial agreement drawn up prior to marrying.

(iv) no matter who chose the lawyers or how the booking came about for the parties to attend upon d lawyers, the wife knew of the appointment (as evidenced by her diary entry in her 2011 day timer) and the purpose of the appointment. (v) i accept the husband\u2019s evidence that during the joint initial consultation the parties were each informed that they would each require their own legal representation if they wished to proceed with the financial agreement. (vi) i accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the joint initial consultation, which according to the wife who had a nail appointment (as noted in her 2011 day timer) at 3.30pm to 4.00pm, would have only lasted until then and that during that time a series of questions were asked by mr b, mostly of the husband, as to their financial situation. (vii) i accept the evidence that at the initial joint consultation with mr b the wife chose to stay with d lawyers for the purposes of the preparation of the financial agreement. (viii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that she did not instruct d lawyers to prepare the draft financial statement. (ix) the wife is an educated and intelligent woman who was aware that the husband and his family required that a financial agreement be entered into prior to the wedding. (x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation. (xii) within days of the initial joint consultation mr b provided a draft of the financial agreement to the husband which was subsequently provided to the husband\u2019s solicitor mr e at e lawyers. (xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife\u2019s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit \u201ci sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b\u201d [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011. (xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit \u201ci do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]\u201d. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated \u201cmy level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both\u201d [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband\u2019s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife\u2019s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement. (xxix) if ms c had not done so, ms c would not have signed the requisite certificate. (xxx) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the contents of the financial agreement when the wife had read the draft, had been spoken to about the amendments, had signed the document and had kept a copy of the financial agreement in her possession since october 2011. (xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement. (c) the nonexistence of a cost agreement and the who paid the account is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding (i) the wife cannot recall receiving or signing a costs agreement from d lawyers. (ii) the hard file of d lawyers is no longer in existence, having been destroyed after 7 years. (iii) the best evidence that exists is a copy of a tax invoice rendered to the wife by d lawyers for $1,540. (iv) there is no evidence that the account was disputed. (v) the account was subsequently paid. (vi) as to who actually paid the account is irrelevant as it was issued to the wife and then paid. (vii) i find that how the account came about and how it was paid is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding. ) subsequent to the appointment the wife chose to use the services of d lawyers in the preparation of the financial agreement and the husband chose to use mr e from e lawyers as his legal representative. (vii) i find that at no time did d lawyers act for both parties in the same or related matters and therefore this is not a matter where reg 11 legal profession uniform law australian solicitors\u2019 conduct rules (nsw) applies.

(x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation. (xii) within days of the initial joint consultation mr b provided a draft of the financial agreement to the husband which was subsequently provided to the husband\u2019s solicitor mr e at e lawyers. (xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife\u2019s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit \u201ci sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b\u201d [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011. (xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit \u201ci do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]\u201d. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated \u201cmy level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both\u201d [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband\u2019s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife\u2019s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement. (xxix) if ms c had not done so, ms c would not have signed the requisite certificate. (xxx) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the contents of the financial agreement when the wife had read the draft, had been spoken to about the amendments, had signed the document and had kept a copy of the financial agreement in her possession since october 2011. (xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement. (c) the nonexistence of a cost agreement and the who paid the account is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding (i) the wife cannot recall receiving or signing a costs agreement from d lawyers. (ii) the hard file of d lawyers is no longer in existence, having been destroyed after 7 years. (iii) the best evidence that exists is a copy of a tax invoice rendered to the wife by d lawyers for $1,540. (iv) there is no evidence that the account was disputed. (v) the account was subsequently paid. (vi) as to who actually paid the account is irrelevant as it was issued to the wife and then paid. (vii) i find that how the account came about and how it was paid is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding. i) i find that at no time did d lawyers act for both parties in the same or related matters and therefore this is not a matter where reg 11 legal profession uniform law australian solicitors\u2019 conduct rules (nsw) applies. (viii) likewise the decision of rees j in bachman & donohoe [2021] fedcfamc1f 240 is also not applicable. in that matter where it was held that independent legal advice had not been given, it was clear that the lawyer was involved with one of the parties (as a friend and part owner of a boat), had acted for one party in the preparation of a will, had given advice to both parties in respect to a property transfer and refinance, had subsequently given legal advice to both parties resulting in the drafting of a financial agreement and it was only shortly before signing that financial agreement that one of the parties was referred to another lawyer for independent advice. this is a very different fact scenario to this matter where the lawyer did not know the parties, had not acted previously for the parties, the joint appointment was information sharing and gathering only and that after the appointment and prior to the preparation of the agreement the wife had chosen d lawyers to retain as her lawyer and the husband had chosen e lawyers as his lawyers. (ix) it was only after the parties had chosen to obtain their own lawyers that the financial agreement was prepared by the wife\u2019s lawyers and subsequently amended at the insistence of the husband\u2019s lawyers. (x) advice as to financial agreement was then provided to the wife and the husband by their respective lawyers. (xi) i therefore find that the husband had never been in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers about the financial agreement and therefore there was no conflict in d lawyers acting for the wife in respect to the financial agreement. (b) the wife did receive independent legal advice in respect to the financial agreement (i) the wife does not dispute that she was in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers but denies that such advice was independent. (ii) the parties had been in discussion about having a financial agreement drawn up prior to marrying. (iii) the wife was aware that the husband\u2019s family together with the husband wanted the financial agreement because of the financial discrepancy between the parties. (iv) no matter who chose the lawyers or how the booking came about for the parties to attend upon d lawyers, the wife knew of the appointment (as evidenced by her diary entry in her 2011 day timer) and the purpose of the appointment. (v) i accept the husband\u2019s evidence that during the joint initial consultation the parties were each informed that they would each require their own legal representation if they wished to proceed with the financial agreement. (vi) i accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the joint initial consultation, which according to the wife who had a nail appointment (as noted in her 2011 day timer) at 3.30pm to 4.00pm, would have only lasted until then and that during that time a series of questions were asked by mr b, mostly of the husband, as to their financial situation. (vii) i accept the evidence that at the initial joint consultation with mr b the wife chose to stay with d lawyers for the purposes of the preparation of the financial agreement. (viii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that she did not instruct d lawyers to prepare the draft financial statement.

(xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife\u2019s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit \u201ci sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b\u201d [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011. (xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit \u201ci do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]\u201d. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated \u201cmy level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both\u201d [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband\u2019s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife\u2019s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement. (xxix) if ms c had not done so, ms c would not have signed the requisite certificate. (xxx) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the contents of the financial agreement when the wife had read the draft, had been spoken to about the amendments, had signed the document and had kept a copy of the financial agreement in her possession since october 2011. (xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement. (c) the nonexistence of a cost agreement and the who paid the account is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding (i) the wife cannot recall receiving or signing a costs agreement from d lawyers. (ii) the hard file of d lawyers is no longer in existence, having been destroyed after 7 years. (iii) the best evidence that exists is a copy of a tax invoice rendered to the wife by d lawyers for $1,540. (iv) there is no evidence that the account was disputed. (v) the account was subsequently paid. (vi) as to who actually paid the account is irrelevant as it was issued to the wife and then paid. (vii) i find that how the account came about and how it was paid is not relevant in determining whether the financial agreement is binding. ) i therefore find that the husband had never been in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers about the financial agreement and therefore there was no conflict in d lawyers acting for the wife in respect to the financial agreement. (b) the wife did receive independent legal advice in respect to the financial agreement (i) the wife does not dispute that she was in receipt of legal advice from d lawyers but denies that such advice was independent. (ii) the parties had been in discussion about having a financial agreement drawn up prior to marrying. (iii) the wife was aware that the husband\u2019s family together with the husband wanted the financial agreement because of the financial discrepancy between the parties. (iv) no matter who chose the lawyers or how the booking came about for the parties to attend upon d lawyers, the wife knew of the appointment (as evidenced by her diary entry in her 2011 day timer) and the purpose of the appointment. (v) i accept the husband\u2019s evidence that during the joint initial consultation the parties were each informed that they would each require their own legal representation if they wished to proceed with the financial agreement. (vi) i accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the joint initial consultation, which according to the wife who had a nail appointment (as noted in her 2011 day timer) at 3.30pm to 4.00pm, would have only lasted until then and that during that time a series of questions were asked by mr b, mostly of the husband, as to their financial situation. (vii) i accept the evidence that at the initial joint consultation with mr b the wife chose to stay with d lawyers for the purposes of the preparation of the financial agreement. (viii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that she did not instruct d lawyers to prepare the draft financial statement. (ix) the wife is an educated and intelligent woman who was aware that the husband and his family required that a financial agreement be entered into prior to the wedding. (x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation.

(xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011.

(xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated \u201cmy level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both\u201d [7].

(xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife\u2019s trial affidavit).

(xxxi) subsequently on october 2011 the wife was sent a tax invoice prepared by ms c from d lawyers as to services rendered for the preparation, amendment and execution of the financial agreement. (xxxii) i find that this tax invoice is evidence that: (a) d lawyers acted only for the wife. (b) d lawyers prepared the financial statement, amended the financial statement and had the financial statement executed. (xxxiii) the tax invoice was subsequently paid. (xxxiv) i therefore find that the wife was in receipt of independent legal advice from the lawyers that were acting for her in regard to the financial agreement. ) the wife is an educated and intelligent woman who was aware that the husband and his family required that a financial agreement be entered into prior to the wedding. (x) the wife was aware after the initial consultation with mr b as to what needed to be done in order to proceed with a financial agreement. (xi) i find that at the initial joint consultation the wife in effect gave the go ahead to mr b to prepare the financial agreement based on the information gathered at the initial consultation. (xii) within days of the initial joint consultation mr b provided a draft of the financial agreement to the husband which was subsequently provided to the husband\u2019s solicitor mr e at e lawyers. (xiii) the wife then attended an appointment at d lawyers at 10.00am in september 2011 (as evidenced by the wife\u2019s diary entry in her 2011 day timer). (xiv) the appointment in september 2011 was with ms c, an employee of d lawyers, who from thereon in had the conduct of the matter on behalf of the wife, with one of her obligations being to inform the wife as to the ramifications of entering into a financial agreement. (xv) as explained by ms c in her affidavit \u201ci sometimes took meetings with clients independently of mr (b). sometimes he would see new clients for initial appointments and then hand the file to me. i would then run with it generally unless there were any concerns, in which case i would go back to mr b\u201d [8]. (xvi) from the evidence it would appear that the appointment in september 2011 was not for the signing of the financial agreement but to go through the draft of the agreement. (xvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife thought at the time that d lawyers was acting either for both of them or for the husband. (xviii) it is clear from the evidence that ms c was acting for the wife and mr e was acting for the husband. (xix) mr e required several amendments to the financial agreement which was communicated to ms c both orally and in writing in september 2011. (xx) ms c in her affidavit explained her limited recall as to her involvement with the matter swearing in her affidavit \u201ci do not specifically recall meeting ms innis or providing advice to her. noting that i signed annexure d to the financial agreement, i presume i did but it was too long ago to remember [6]\u201d. (xxi) ms c however had a vague recollection of the wife remembering that she was a student [5]. (xxii) ms c further stated \u201cmy level of responsibility while employed at d lawyers depended on the type of matter. i sometimes gave advice on financial agreements. i gave such advice in a combination of oral and written form. i cannot remember whether it was always oral and written at that time - certainly my practice now is to do both\u201d [7]. (xxiii) there is nothing in the evidence to suggest that ms c acted inappropriately at any time in her role as a qualified solicitor acting for the wife in the financial agreement. (xxiv) i do not accept that the wife was not aware of the husband having other lawyers acting on his behalf in respect to the financial agreement. (xxv) i have no doubt that ms c would have obtained instructions from the wife as to the amendments to the financial agreement as suggested by the husband\u2019s lawyers. (xxvi) although the wife has no recollection as to the subsequent appointment with ms c in september 2011 (although her written and oral evidence on this issue was muddled), the evidence supports that on that day the amendments had been made and incorporated into the financial agreement, the financial agreement had been signed by the wife (with ms c witnessing her signature), ms c had signed the certificate of independent advice and was provided with a copy of the financial agreement ([67] wife\u2019s trial affidavit). (xxvii) i do not accept the wife\u2019s evidence that the wife had never received any legal advice from ms c about the financial agreement or that she was unaware of the impact that it would have upon the wife should the parties separate. (xxviii) i have no doubt that ms c would have explained the financial agreement to the wife and provided her with independent evidence as to the effect, advantages and disadvantages of the agreement.

the financial agreement, clause 2.10 states that the husband \u201cconfirms that annexure a fully and adequately discloses the identity, nature and estimated value of his separate assets, financial resources and liabilities as at the date of this agreement\u201d. (b) the husband sets out in the financial agreement under annexure a his assets liabilities and financial resources (annexure a) as follows: the husband sets out in the financial agreement under annexure a his assets liabilities and financial resources (annexure a) as follows: assets agreed estimated value real estate h street, town j business interest in company k of country g (equipment and liquid assets) assets silver bonds gold bonds motor vehicles motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation h street, town j business interest in company k of country g (equipment and liquid assets) assets silver bonds gold bonds motor vehicles motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation business interest in company k of country g (equipment and liquid assets) assets silver bonds gold bonds motor vehicles motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation assets silver bonds gold bonds motor vehicles motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation silver bonds gold bonds motor vehicles motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation gold bonds motor vehicles motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation motor vehicles motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation motor vehicle 1 superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation husband\u2019s australian superannuation $365,000.00 $950,000.00 $220,000.00 $1,300,000.00 $30,000.00 $10,000.00 $950,000.00 $220,000.00 $1,300,000.00 $30,000.00 $10,000.00 $220,000.00 $1,300,000.00 $30,000.00 $10,000.00 $1,300,000.00 $30,000.00 $10,000.00 $30,000.00 $10,000.00 $10,000.00 total assets $2,875,000.00 liabilities mortgage anz bank outstanding loans to brother mr l with respect to business interest detailed above anz bank outstanding loans to brother mr l with respect to business interest detailed above outstanding loans to brother mr l with respect to business interest detailed above $30,000.00 $200,000.00 $200,000.00 total liabilities $230,000.00 total net assets $2,645,000.00 the husband in annexure a made misrepresentations as to the following assets and liabilities: (i) extent of the husband\u2019s equity in h street, town j (a) the husband acquired the title to h street, town j (h street, town j) in september 2011, one month before the execution date of the financial agreement. (b) it is not in dispute that as at the date of the financial agreement, h street, town j was valued at $365,000 which reflected the purchase price paid by the husband. (c) the husband however stated in annexure a that the mortgage to anz (mortgage) over h street, town j was $30,000, which inferred that the husband had equity in h street, town j in the sum of $335,000. (d) however the husband states in the trial affidavit that the mortgage was the difference between the purchase price of $365,000 and the deposit of $50,000 [9]. (e) therefore as at october 2011 the mortgage was $315,000 (and not $30,000 as indicated by the husband) and the husband\u2019s equity was $50,000 and not the sum of $335,000 as reflected in annexure a. (f) the husband therefore misrepresented the extent of his equity in h street, town j. (ii) value of company k, country g (a) the husband in annexure a values company k of country g (company k) with its equipment and liquid assets at $950,000. (b) in addition under the separate heading of \u201cassets\u201d the husband includes silver bonds of $220,000 and gold bonds of $1,300,000 (the bonds). (c) how the husband came to these figures has not been addressed by the husband in his trial affidavit. (d) during cross-examination the following emerged: the bonds were not separate but formed part of the assets of company k. the $950,000 figure was incorrect as the bonds should have been included in the value of company k. the husband said that he calculated the value of the bonds by looking at their current value in 2011 although no explanation was given as to what that actually entailed and the husband admitted that he did not know the number of bonds held by company k. (e) the husband therefore misrepresented the true value of company k. (f) as it unclear as to what the true value of company k was, it is not possible to ascertain the total net assets. (iii) ownership of company k (a) a reading of the financial agreement and annexure a indicates that the husband was the sole owner of company k. (b) the husband\u2019s trial affidavit states however that \u201cthe country g assets in which i have an interest were owned with my brother, mr l (mr l), namely... an interest in a business, the company k of country g of which, in 2011, i was a director and shareholder, and... gold and silver bonds, which were assets of the company k\u201d [27]. (c) however in cross-examination the following emerged: the husband\u2019s brother (the brother) was the sole person who established company k at a time when the husband was living overseas. the husband\u2019s only hands on involvement with company k was to help out the brother when he was visiting country g doing such things as answering the phone, cleaning the floors or locking up. in 2006 or 2008 the brother transferred for \u201cno money\u201d company k (together with the interest in the bonds) to the husband. the reason for the transfer was to protect the brother\u2019s assets from any liabilities, provide possible tax breaks to the brother and to take the brother\u2019s assets as he was going through some legal problems. as a consequence of the transfer the husband became the sole director and sole shareholder of company k. the husband had no difficulty with the transfer as he felt that he owed the brother because of the extent of the financial support the brother had provided when the husband was studying. the husband was aware that whilst the transfer resulted in the husband being the legal owner of company k, there was no financial benefit for the husband as he was holding company k on behalf of the brother to protect the brother. this continued to be the situation when the husband entered into the financial agreement in october 2011. the husband maintained that he had informed mr b that on paper company k belonged to the husband. from 2006 or 2008 until the return of company k to mr l in 2013 the husband received \u201cno money\u201d from company k. in 2013 the husband for \u201cno money\u201d transferred his interest in company k and the bonds back to the brother. the transfer took place because by that time the brother was no longer in a position where the brother feared losing his assets and the husband was in a position where as a non-resident of country g there were \u201castronomical\u201d tax implications in country g if the husband was to continue to be involved in company k. (d) the financial makes no reference to this arrangement between the husband and the brother as to company k (the arrangement). (e) i do not accept that the arrangement was discussed adequately with mr b because if it had been then it would have been reflected in the financial agreement. (f) further there is no evidence that the husband raised the arrangement with mr e. (g) again mr e would have ensured that the arrangement was reflected in the financial agreement. (h) the inclusion of the arrangement was not one of the amendments sought by the lawyers for the husband to the financial agreement in september 2011. (i) i find that the husband misrepresented the arrangement when providing instructions to his lawyers in respect to the financial agreement and therefore misrepresented in the financial agreement that the husband had an entitlement of any nature to the assets of company k including the bonds. (j) as the husband had no financial entitlement to company k or the bonds, then these items should never have been included in annexure a as property owned by the husband. (iv) loan of $200,000 (a) an explanation as to this loan is not contained in the financial agreement. (b) an explanation as to this loan is not contained in the husband\u2019s trial affidavit. (c) the husband in cross-examination was adamant that company k was acquired by the husband for no money, that the husband did not receive any money when company k was in his name and that no money was received when company k was transferred back to the brother. (d) an explanation as to this loan was not the subject of cross-examination. (e) i find that in the absence of any evidence to support a legitimate loan of $200, 000, that the husband misrepresented the existence of this loan. (f) this amount should therefore have not been included in annexure a. (d) the wife had no comprehensive knowledge of the arrangement and i make this finding based on the following: (i) i accept from the evidence that the wife has very limited knowledge as to the assets and liabilities that the husband supposedly held as at the date of the financial agreement. (ii) the husband admits that at the joint consultation with d lawyers, it was the husband that answered the bulk of the questions about the parties\u2019 financial affairs. (iii) it is clear from the wife\u2019s trial affidavit that the wife held no understanding as to the arrangement between the husband and the brother. (iv) i accept that the wife\u2019s attempts to extract information from the husband as to his financial affairs and in husband\u2019s interest in the brother\u2019s business were unsuccessful leading up to the preparation of the financial agreement. (v) the husband in cross-examination was vague as to whether he had informed the wife as to the arrangement in regard to company k, or his financial situation using such phrases as: (a) \u201ci\u2019m sure we\u2019ve had a discussion that i had assets in country g\u201d (b) \u201cit would have been raised\u201d (c) \u201cwe would have had discussions\u201d (d) \u201ci would have said\u201d (vi) the husband\u2019s vagueness continued in the following exchange between the bench and the husband during cross examination: extent of the husband\u2019s equity in h street, town j (a) the husband acquired the title to h street, town j (h street, town j) in september 2011, one month before the execution date of the financial agreement. (b) it is not in dispute that as at the date of the financial agreement, h street, town j was valued at $365,000 which reflected the purchase price paid by the husband. (c) the husband however stated in annexure a that the mortgage to anz (mortgage) over h street, town j was $30,000, which inferred that the husband had equity in h street, town j in the sum of $335,000. (d) however the husband states in the trial affidavit that the mortgage was the difference between the purchase price of $365,000 and the deposit of $50,000 [9]. (e) therefore as at october 2011 the mortgage was $315,000 (and not $30,000 as indicated by the husband) and the husband\u2019s equity was $50,000 and not the sum of $335,000 as reflected in annexure a. (f) the husband therefore misrepresented the extent of his equity in h street, town j. (ii) value of company k, country g (a) the husband in annexure a values company k of country g (company k) with its equipment and liquid assets at $950,000. (b) in addition under the separate heading of \u201cassets\u201d the husband includes silver bonds of $220,000 and gold bonds of $1,300,000 (the bonds). (c) how the husband came to these figures has not been addressed by the husband in his trial affidavit. (d) during cross-examination the following emerged: the bonds were not separate but formed part of the assets of company k. the $950,000 figure was incorrect as the bonds should have been included in the value of company k. the husband said that he calculated the value of the bonds by looking at their current value in 2011 although no explanation was given as to what that actually entailed and the husband admitted that he did not know the number of bonds held by company k. (e) the husband therefore misrepresented the true value of company k. (f) as it unclear as to what the true value of company k was, it is not possible to ascertain the total net assets. (iii) ownership of company k (a) a reading of the financial agreement and annexure a indicates that the husband was the sole owner of company k. (b) the husband\u2019s trial affidavit states however that \u201cthe country g assets in which i have an interest were owned with my brother, mr l (mr l), namely... an interest in a business, the company k of country g of which, in 2011, i was a director and shareholder, and... gold and silver bonds, which were assets of the company k\u201d [27].

(b) in addition under the separate heading of \u201cassets\u201d the husband includes silver bonds of $220,000 and gold bonds of $1,300,000 (the bonds).

(c) the husband in cross-examination was adamant that company k was acquired by the husband for no money, that the husband did not receive any money when company k was in his name and that no money was received when company k was transferred back to the brother. (d) an explanation as to this loan was not the subject of cross-examination. (e) i find that in the absence of any evidence to support a legitimate loan of $200, 000, that the husband misrepresented the existence of this loan.

[mr hale] is not the sole director and secretary of the company.[6] the length of cohabitation between the wife and me was accordingly about 11 years 2 months but with countless separations in between.[7] procedural history of the litigation legal considerations subject to this part, to the regulations and the applicable rules of court, all decrees made under this act may be enforced by any court having jurisdiction under this act. if: (a) an order under this act has directed a person to execute a deed or instrument, and (b) that person has refused or neglected to comply with the direction or, for any other reason, the court considers it necessary to exercise the powers of the court under this subsection, an order under this act has directed a person to execute a deed or instrument, and (b) that person has refused or neglected to comply with the direction or, for any other reason, the court considers it necessary to exercise the powers of the court under this subsection, that person has refused or neglected to comply with the direction or, for any other reason, the court considers it necessary to exercise the powers of the court under this subsection, the court may appoint an officer of the court or other person to execute the deed or instrument in the name of the person to whom the direction was given and to do all acts and things necessary to give validity and operation to the deed or instrument. i have come to the conclusion that, in a matter which affects closely the property rights of a party, i should interpret strictly the language of the act and consequently it cannot be said that a person has refused or neglected to comply with a direction unless that obligation of that person has been clearly spelt out. for that reason, i hold that there must be a specific order directing the wife to execute a deed or instrument before sec. 84(1) [the precursor to section 106a] can operate. once that direction has been given and not complied with, the court may appoint an officer of the court to execute the deed or instrument in question in the name of the person to whom the direction was given and further to do all acts and things necessary to give validity and operation to the deed or instrument. in other words, there is no need to specify the execution of all ancillary documents. 3.1 that, the [e street] property shall be listed for sale by private treaty with a registered real estate agent to be agreed in writing by both parties within 30 days of the date of this order. 3.2 the list price of the [e street] property shall be such amount as is agreed between the parties and failing agreement as advised by the real estate agent. 3.3 the parties agree that the reserve price for the sale of the [e street] property will be $95,000.00. 3.4 the parties are to co-operate in every way with the real estate agent in relation to the marketing of the [e street] property for sale including making the property readily available, allowing inspection of the [e street] property at all times as may be reasonably requested by the agent. it is noted that if the applicant wishes to make improvements to the property, that she is at liberty to do so at her sole expense. 3.5 that upon agreement being reached for sale of the [e street] property the parties shall execute the contract of sale and other documents necessary to complete the sale of the [e street] property including all transfer documentation forthwith upon its submission to them by the agent or their solicitor. 3.6 within seven days of the execution of the contract of sale, the parties are to appoint a conveyancer to effect settlement and such conveyancer to be agreed in writing by both parties. 3.7 the contract of sale shall provide for a settlement date 30 days after the date of the contract. 3.8 that until settlement of the [e street] property, the applicant agrees to: 3.8.1 pay all rates and taxes levied against the [e street] home until settlement of sale of the [e street] home, 3.8.2 insure the [e street] home including public liability, contents and all buildings and structures and other improvements against fire, explosion, lighting, storm and civil commotion including vandalism, malicious damage and burglary, 3.8.3 maintain the [e street] home, and 3.8.4 allow the applicant peaceful possession and occupation of the [e street] home, if applicable, without interruption or disturbance from the respondent. 3.8.5 the proceeds of the sale of the [e street] property shall be paid in the following manner and priority: 3.8.6 in payment of all costs of and incidental to the sale of the property including the agents fees and conveyancing costs, 3.8.7 the sum of thirty thousand dollars to be retained in the trust

(emphasis added) not long after that nygh j said this in mcenerney & mcenerney [1980] famca 43, (1980) flc 90-866 at 75,499: ....the principle that there be an end to litigation has equal force in custodial disputes and in some respects may have even greater force in custodial disputes. the last thing, of course, that this court would wish to see would be a perennial football match between parents, who, because the strict principles of res judicata are not applicable might seek to canvass again and again the question of custody of a child with the enormous psychological harm which they would be inflicting not only upon each other but especially upon the child. one comes back to the fundamental principle that the interest of the child are paramount and that consideration alone should lead a court to discourage a parent from coming back before the court too soon after the court has had an opportunity to consider fully the situation of the child and there is really no startling new circumstances that can be brought before the court. (emphasis added) similarly, the icl referred me to langmeil & grange (2013) famcafc 31 (\u201clangmeil & grange\u201d), where it was said that the rule in rice & asplund is founded on the notion that continuous litigation over children is generally not in their best interests. that consideration arises squarely in this matter. in a recent decision of the appeal division in the matter of trewitt & brock [2021] fedcfamc1a 9 (\u201ctrewitt\u201d), there was a discussion about whether dismissal of an application such as the father\u2019s, is a parenting order with the meaning of s 64b(1) of the act. that section provides: (1) a parenting order is: an order under this part (including an order until further order) dealing with a matter mentioned in subsection (2), or (b) an order under this part discharging, varying, suspending or reviving an order, or part of an order, described in paragraph (a). however, a declaration or order under subdivision e of division 12 is not a parenting order. the father asks me to make parenting orders. however in trewitt the appeal division reminded at [25]-[26]: it is important to note that s 64b of the act refers in terms to the making of an order and not to the nature of the application that led to the order itself. attention must be given to the nature of the order itself and not the application that led to the order being made. here the father sought to vary the existing orders so that there was to be equal shared parental responsibility and the imposition of an equal time arrangement. if those orders were made they would unquestionably be parenting orders as defined by s 64b of the act. they were not the orders made and the application was simply dismissed. such an order of dismissal, however, does not discharge, vary, suspend or revive an order made under s 64b(2) of the act. therefore there is some difficulty in describing the order of dismissal as a parenting order. 40 relevantly, this was also held in trewitt at [29]-[31]: the weight of authority and the terms of s 64b of the act itself point to the order dismissing the father\u2019s application made by her honour as not being a parenting order within that section. that being so, the court is not obliged to have regard to the mandatory terms of s 60cc of the act. nonetheless, as the authorities make clear, the determination of whether there should be a reconsideration of existing parenting orders, is one that must be made in the best interests of the child. often that determination will focus on the nature of the change in circumstances, if any, and the detriment to the child of further litigation. considerations raised by s 60cc of the act may also, obviously, be relevant. the nature of the proceeding was aptly described by warnick j in sps and pls [2008] famcafc 16, (2008) flc 93-363 (\u201csps\u201d) (which explanation was approved in marsden & winch (2009) 42 fam lr 1 (\u201cmarsden\u201d) at [41]\u2013[47], langmeil & grange [2013] famcafc 31 at [46] and poisat at [40]) as follows: 81. ... [w]hen the threshold question described in rice and asplund is determined as a preliminary matter, it remains a determination \u201con the merits\u201d. where an application is dismissed at a preliminary stage, it is not dismissed for some technical reason, such as the failure of a party to appear or some lack of compliance with form and procedure but rather because, assuming the evidence of the applicant is accepted, there is an insufficient change of circumstance shown to justify embarking on a hearing. though sometimes unstated, the underlying conclusion will or ought be that the interests of the child in not being the subject of further litigation is more powerfully in the child\u2019s welfare than to allow the application to continue. hasis added) the icl referred me to the decision of king & finneran [2001] famca 344, (2001) flc 93-079, where the application was dismissed for lacking a significant change in circumstance. it echoes what was said by warnick j above, and particularly that the rice & asplund issue can be determined at a preliminary stage. the best interests of the children section 60cc considerations subsection (2a): the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents: a primary consideration subsection (2b): the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. section 60cc additional considerations subsection (3)(a): any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child\u2019s views 65 the children are both in good physical health. the children have been impacted emotionally by their experience of abuse at the hands of the father. i facilitated their attendance on their psychologist to help them deal with their responses to their experiences. [w] last saw his psychologist in august 2022 and [y] in october 2022. [y] experienced challenges with his mental health last year. in or around november 2022, [w] disclosed to me that he experienced flashbacks to being kicked by his paternal grandfather, while lying on the floor. he told me that he experienced this flashback while playing roughly, as boys do, with [y]. i have spoken to each of the boys about seeing their father again. [y] is very adamant that he wants nothing to do with his father and is very angry at the thought that he may have to see him. [w] says that he feels like his father cannot be trusted and that he doesn't want trouble again. although i accept the icl\u2019s submission that the children\u2019s views should be considered in the context of their young age, i attach weight to the family consultant\u2019s comment that the older child presented as \u201carticulate\u201d and \u201cmature\u201d in her oral evidence that it was her impression that both children \u201cclearly remembered\u201d events that they had described. these views of the children are shared by departmental officers who noted that they observed the children to \u201ccommunicate exceptionally well both during the interview with [police] and during a home visit. (emphasis added) subsection (3)(b): the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child\u2019s parents, and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) subsection (3)(c): the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity: (i) to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, (ii) to spend time with the child, and, (iii) to communicate with the child subsection (3)(ca): the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent\u2019s obligations to maintain the child subsection (3)(d): the likely effect of any changes in the child\u2019s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents, or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living subsection (3)(e): the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with the parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the child\u2019s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis subsection (3)(f): the capacity of: (i) each of the child\u2019s parents, and (ii) any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs subsection (3)(g): the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and of either of the child\u2019s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant subsection (3)(h): if the child is an aboriginal child or a torres strait islander child: the child\u2019s right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order under this part will have on that right subsection (3)(i): the attitude to the child, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the child's parents subsection (3)(j): any family violence involving the child or a member of the child's family subsection (3)(k): if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the child or a member of the child\u2019s family \u2013 any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the following: the nature of the order, the circumstances in which the order was made, any findings made by the court in, or in proceedings for, the order, any other relevant matter subsection (3)(l): whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child subsection (3)(m): any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is

feel it in my heart and soul. babe, i\u2019m begging you. please give this another go. x i take the \u201cx\u201d to mean a kiss, and this was followed by a text: the drugs was a massive part of anxiety and behaviour. ...when he brings me lunch in torrential rain that i might add he made himself. if usual or ordinary contributions were sufficient to amount to \u201csubstantial contributions\u201d within the meaning of section 90sb(c), then there would be little purpose in the two-year requirement being included in section 90sb(a) of the act. the word \u201csubstantial\u201d is not only susceptible of ambiguity, it is a word calculated to conceal a lack of precision. in the phrase \u201csubstantial loss or damage\u201d, it can, in an appropriate context, mean real or of substance as distinct from ephemeral or nominal. it can also mean large, weighty or big. it can be used in a relative sense or can indicate an absolute significance, quantity or size. the difficulties and uncertainties which the use of the word is liable to cause are well illustrated by the guidance given by viscount simon in palser v grinling ([1948] ac 291 at 317), where, after holding that, in the context there under consideration, the meaning of the word was equivalent to \u201cconsiderable, solid or big\u201d, he said, \u2018applying the word in this sense, it must be left to the discretion of the judge of fact to decide as best he can, according to the circumstances of each case... clearly the \u201csubstantial contributions\u201d test is a subjective one. any effort to elucidate its meaning by use of other words or phrases will simply replace one subjective test with another. it will remain a matter of impression whether the contributions are considered to be \u201csubstantial\u201d. while recognising that the test is subjective, we are nevertheless inclined to agree with thackray j, who said in thorburn & oswald [2007] fcwa 43 at 54 said that a trial judge: would need to interpret the word \u201csubstantial\u201d in the context of the financial position of the parties. what might appear to be a \u201csubstantial contribution\u201d for people of limited financial resources, might not be substantial in a case involving very wealthy parties. what is the meaning of \u2018serious injustice\u2019? the meaning of \u201cserious injustice\u201d was considered in ollie where judge whelan at [19] to [29] said: \u201c[19] in miller, coates fm dealt with the issue of \u2018serious injustice\u2019 in the following passage: \u2018the act recognises that an injustice may occur and so sets a higher test being a serious injustice. the word serious in this context, taken from the concise oxford dictionary, must mean not slight. the macquarie encyclopedic dictionary uses the words weighty or important. these meanings show a difference by marked degree from a mere injustice\u2019 ] his honour later referred to the difference between a \u2018serious injustice\u2019 and an order made on the basis of justice and equity: \u2018while an assessment of the possible division of property without testing the evidence is to some extent a hypothetical exercise, any division of course must be made on a justice and equity basis. but because the order altering the property must be just and equitable, as well as the percentage division, it follows that this aspect of justice and equity is not the same as a person suffering a serious injustice, because a claim was not allowed to proceed\u2019 ]the respondent referred the court to two judgments concerning similar legislation to the act provisions where the concept of \u2018serious injustice\u2019 was considered. the first of these is a judgment of potter j of the new zealand high court in x and y [2010] nzhc 287. the judgment was in an appeal against a decision of the family court concerning s.14a of the property (relationships) act 1976 (nz) (the \u2018pra\u2019). section 14a of the pra provides: \u2018(1) this section applies if a de facto relationship is a relationship of short duration (as defined in section 2e). (section 2e defined a relation for a period of less than three years as a relationship of short duration). (2) if this section applies, an order cannot be made under this act for the division of relationship property unless \u2013 the court is satisfied \u2013 that there is a child of the de facto relationship, or (ii) that the applicant has made a substantial contribution to the de facto relationship, and the court is satisfied that failure to make the order would result in serious injustice\u2019 ] the judge at first instance had referred to the meaning of \u2018serious injustice\u2019 in various judgments where the term was considered. heath j in henry v williams [2004] 2 nzlr 132, for example, said: \u2018... the term \u2018serious injustice\u2019 suggests injustice of a type that the court cannot tolerate. while not creating a standard as high as the \u201crepugnant to the interests of justice\u201d test used in s 13 of the 1976 act ... the term requires a degree of injustice sufficient to require the court to intervene\u2019 ] her honour noted that both judge inglis qc in gibbons v vowles (2003) 22 frnz 946 (\u2018gibbons\u2019) and judge ullrich in ls v zj [2005] nzflr 932 had considered that: \u2018... the injustice must be sufficiently serious to justify departure from the general rule that where the de facto relationship is of short duration no order can be made, the primary rule being that de facto relationships of short duration do not come under the pra at all\u2019 ] justice potter, on the appeal, found that: \u2018... there is an implicit requirement for the applicant who seeks orders from the court under s 14a to place before the court evidence which will both satisfy the court that one or other of the threshold requirements has been met and that the situation is such that serious injustice would result from failure to make an order\u2019 ] his honour quoted from the judgment of judge inglis qc in gibbons where he said: \u2018i consider that this door [to s.14a(3)] cannot be opened in the absence of detailed and specific evidence indicating in precisely what respects not opening the door could result in an injustice which is sufficiently serious to justify departure from the general rule that where the de facto relationship is of short duration no order ... can be made\u2019 ] justice potter further quoted from gibbons where his honour said: \u2018the exercise of determining whether \u2018serious injustice\u2019 does or does not arise necessarily involves comparison between the consequence for the parties as the result of the determination, though other factors which may assist in a finding whether or not there is \u2018serious injustice\u2019 are not excluded\u2019 ] the respondent also referred to the decision of besanko j in the supreme court of the act in mcmaster & wilkie-snow [2011] actsc 183, a judgment concerning s.15(1) of the domestic relationships act 1994 (act) (the \u2018dra\u2019). that matter concerned an application to set aside a domestic relationship agreement on the grounds that, in the circumstances, the enforcement of the agreement would result in serious injustice. in that judgment, her honour said the following about the term \u2018serious injustice\u2019: \u2018the meaning of serious injustice was considered by riley j invan jole v cole [2000] ntsc 18, 26 fam lr 228. his honour said that the words \u2018serious injustice\u2019 in s 46 of the de facto relationships act 1991 (nt) were to be accorded their ordinary meaning which was a considerable wrong or unfairness. i accept those observations, although one could also describe the requirement in terms of significant or substantial unfairness ...\u2019 ] in van jole v cole [2000] ntsc 18, (2000) 26 fam lr 228 (\u2018van jole\u2019), riley j of the northern territory supreme court was also dealing with the issue of whether a separation agreement made under the dra should be set aside. his honour stated: \u2018it is clear that the court will not interfere with a separation agreement simply because it believes a different form of agreement was more appropriate. further it will not interfere where there is simple injustice. rather, it must be satisfied that a failure to intervene would result in \u201cserious injustice\u201d between the parties... an injustice is the opposite of justice and includes the concepts of a wrong or unfairness. the word serious in this context suggests weighty, grave or considerable\u2019 ] in lf v ra [2005] qsc 375, (2005) 34 fam lr 536, white j of the queensland supreme court was dealing with an application for a property adjustment order pursuant to s.286 of the property law act 1974 (qld) (the \u2018pla\u2019). the parties had entered into a cohabitation agreement. section 276 of the pla provided that, on application for a property adjustment order, the court may vary the provisions of such an agreement if it was satisfied that enforcement would result in serious injustice for a party to the agreement. his honour adopted the approach in van jole and commented: it is not, of course, a serious imbalance of itself which will give rise to a conclusion of serious injustice. the detail of the relationship and the parties\u2019 financial and other contributions to the acquisition of the assets in the course of the relationship will be determinative of that question\u2019\u201d there must be something more than just \u201cmere injustice\u201d or \u201csimple injustice\u201d, (b) the injustice must be \u201csufficiently serious\u201d where there is \u201cconsiderable wrong\u201d or \u201cunfairness\u201d, (c) there is more to be taken into account than a \u201ccomparison of consequences\u201d, (d) there must be a \u201cweighty, grave or considerable\u201d serious \u201cimbalance\u201d. the injustice must

the date of mr s\u2019s affidavit filed 27 october 2022, mr s loaned monies to the wife. these monies were used by the wife to pay the mortgage loan repayments for the property, to pay legal fees, and

legal fees. her former lawyers, ax lawyers, were owed $80,000 by the wife for their fees and these fees were paid. the court infers that the wife utilised monies loaned from mr s to pay these fees of

for judgment judge betts 1 these reasons for judgment were delivered orally. they have been corrected from the transcript so as to make them more readable. 2 these are property settlement proceedings arising out of the breakdown of the marriage between the applicant wife, ms petrone and the respondent husband, mr petrone, conducted pursuant to the provisions of part viii of the family law act. 3 the proceedings have had something of an unfortunate history. they were commenced way back in 2017 and, having been set down for trial last year, the trial was then unable to proceed due to circumstances beyond anyone\u2019s control. instead, on 29 september 2020, the proceedings were adjourned for final hearing with priority for three days commencing this week, namely 1, 2 and 3 november 2021. 4 regrettably, the trial this week has had to be adjourned for reasons that i will shortly come to. 5 by way of brief background, the parties were in a lengthy relationship, but it can fairly be said that the overwhelming assets in this case are assets held by the estate of the wife\u2019s late mother, ms e, who passed away in 2015. the will of the late ms e expressly vested her estate in her then solicitor, mr d, and her dear friend, as she is described in the will, ms c, both of town f. 6 clause 7 of the deceased\u2019s will provided as follows: i direct that my trustee not administer my estate so as to see a benefit pass to any of my named beneficiaries in circumstances where such administration would put at risk a gift to the beneficiary through a property settlement pursuant to the family law act, a claim from a creditor, or other obvious wastage. in these circumstances my trustee has absolute discretion as to when and if a gift under my will should vest in any beneficiary notwithstanding any age requirement of my will or other condition... 7 and the clause goes on to say other things that are not directly relevant. 8 i should add here that the wife in this case is the only child of the deceased, that the assets of the deceased dwarf the assets held by the parties in this case in their own names, which primarily comprise superannuation in preserved form. 9 the matter has already come before me previously and this was on an application to restrain mr d from continuing to act on behalf of the wife. it was reported in volume 60 of the family law reports at page 108 as petrone & petrone. i do not propose to restate what i said in that decision, but it forms part of the relevant background to the case. 10 subsequent to my decision at that time, which was that mr d not be restrained from continuing to act, the husband filed a further amended response on 24 may 2020. that further amended response expressly struck out the husband\u2019s previous claim for relief pursuant to section 106b of the family law act, which relevantly sought to set aside clause 7 of the will. 11 in this case, section 106b is potentially engaged on the evidence of the husband. essentially, in round terms, his case is that the late ms e held her interest in her home, which forms part of the estate, on trust for the parties pursuant to a constructive trust. there is also a claim of equitable estoppel that the husband brings and there are various other equitable claims. 12 but the husband\u2019s case as pleaded in the further amended response had some fatal flaws when the matter came before me for trial yesterday. in the course of discussing the section 106b aspect of the case, as well as questions concerning the parties to the proceedings, it became quite apparent that there was no pathway to the relief pleaded by the husband. in a practical sense this case is only commercially viable for the husband if he succeeds in clawing back the estate assets of the wife\u2019s late mother - or bringing her estate into the balance sheet \u2013 which is vigorously opposed by the wife. 13 but the fundamental problem for the husband is that at no point have the trustees of the deceased\u2019s will been joined as parties to the proceedings. this is despite the fact that: (a) they have an obvious right to be heard in terms of the interpretation of the will (specifically clause 7), and (b) they have an obvious right to be heard in terms of the section 106b relief. they have an obvious right to be heard in terms of the interpretation of the will (specifically clause 7), and (b) they have an obvious right to be heard in terms of the section 106b relief. 14 the husband\u2019s section 106b claim forms part and parcel of his case but had apparently been inadvertently struck out in his further amended response. i was advised that apparently this was due to some form of \u201cclerical error\u201d. 15 it is clear enough that the trustees need to be parties. if the deceased was still alive and the husband was asserting the existence of a trust, she would clearly have a right to be heard, as the property would presumably still be in her name. the situation does not change with her passing away. the estate executors under her will \u2013 the trustees - have a right to be heard as to whether any part of that estate is subject to a constructive trust. the will has been admitted to probate in the supreme court of new south wales. they have a clear interest in upholding the will. indeed, they have a duty to do so. 16 without having the trustees as parties, i do not see how this trial could be conducted according to law, at least in terms of giving the husband the relief that he seeks. 17 this was observed both by ms gillies sc, who appears for the wife, and also by me yesterday. i indicated at that time that it seemed to be essential to have the trustees as parties if the husband was going to be able to have any sort of arguable case. but it was also obvious from the submissions made by ms gillies sc that the wife did not want to see the matter adjourned (for that to occur) and would prefer to see the matter dealt with. the wife has had her own estate entitlements pursuant to this will effectively on hold for quite some time, years in fact. and she had an interest in the matter proceeding to a conclusion, just as much as the husband did. 18 the matter was then stood down for a period of time, following which mr bateman tendered as exhibit 1 a document which particularised the husband\u2019s section 106b claim (previously struck out) and which also sought, amongst other things, the joinder of the trustees as second respondents. 19 it was indicated to me by mr bateman that effectively the striking out of the section 106b relief in the further amended response was some sort of administrative error and effectively it was also conceded that the trustees did need to be parties. 20 however, it is not conceded by the husband\u2019s legal representatives that they ought to pay the costs of any adjournment in the event that the trial is to be adjourned (to enable this to occur). 21 the husband is under a legal disability. he suffered from a burst aneurysm or aneurysms in his brain, as a result of which he has memory and other difficulties and is in receipt of a disability support pension. he is in something of a disadvantaged state in that sense. he has his brother act for him as litigation guardian. 22 in light of the wife\u2019s foreshadowed costs application that may be made against the husband\u2019s legal representatives in the event the adjournment was granted, the matter was stood down. 23 when the matter came back on, mr bateman advised that the husband had now instructed, or the litigation guardian had instructed, that the joinder of the trustees was no longer being sought, nor was the section 106b application now being pressed. effectively, the husband was retreating from the full ambit of his claim, in such circumstances where his access to relief would be limited to the identifiable matrimonial property, which is not part of the deceased\u2019s estate, although i should mention that the husband also has a separate claim for spousal maintenance as well. 24 i invited mr bateman to outline to me the basis upon which the husband could in any way access the estate property in the event that he withdrew his 106b application and in the event that the joinder was not pressed. 25 mr bateman made various submissions to me, to the effect that there would still potentially be relief available to the husband in respect of the estate. he submitted that the formation of the trust in this case aligned with a constructive trust in that he said there was promise, reliance and damage in this case to the person acting in reliance - relevantly the husband. he submitted that the corpus of the trust was moveable, it was in the form of real estate now in the pool of an unadministered deceased estate and it was contended to me that an order could be made in respect of that corpus, transmogrified into its current form. 26 but with all due respect to mr bateman, the difficulty is as i identified earlier, that even if that was so, the trustees of the estate have a right to be heard as to whether or not a constructive trust or other equitable relief ought to be granted by the court. and there really is not any answer to that in my view fundamental and fatal flaw in the husband\u2019s application. 27 at that time i indicated to mr bateman that, given the husband\u2019s disability and given what i saw was effectively the husband pressing on with a case that was doomed to failure, that it was one of those unusual circumstances where the husband may need to obtain independent advice, ie. advice from someone other than mr bateman and his solicitor, mr paton. 28 i indicated this because it seemed to me that there was a potential for a conflict of interest between the husband on the one hand and his legal representatives on the other, given the potential for costs orders against the husband\u2019s lawyers. 29 i should also add here that ms gillies sc fairly and squarely foreshadowed that if the husband proceeded to trial on this more limited basis, that she would be making submissions that that estate aspect of the case should be struck out. this was entirely appropriate with respect to ms gillies sc. she was demonstrating candour and fairness in her dealings with her opponent and in my view it was entirely appropriate that she put on record her intention to make such application - which frankly i think would have been unanswerable. 30 on that basis, the matter was stood over to today and the husband has, again through mr bateman, changed his position. he has renewed his application for joinder of the trustees. he has renewed his reliance upon exhibit 1, which was tendered yesterday. ms gillies sc has properly and fairly conceded that it cannot be said that if the husband\u2019s case was properly pleaded that it is \u201cdoomed to failure\u201d. 31 and in those circumstances, the question before me relevantly becomes whether: (a) i press on with the trial, forcing the husband to run a case that is clearly not ready to run in terms of the relief sought, or (b) i adjourn the trial with obvious disadvantage to everyone involved but with the advantage that at least the case can be presented properly and in a way that squarely and fairly raises the issues for the court\u2019s determination. i press on with the trial, forcing the husband to run a case that is clearly not ready to run in terms of the relief sought, or (b) i adjourn the trial with obvious disadvantage to everyone involved but with the advantage that at least the case can be presented properly and in a way that squarely and fairly raises the issues for the court\u2019s determination. 32 ms gillies understandably relied upon the high court\u2019s decision in aon risk services australia limited v australian national university [2009] hca 27, which i do not propose to repeat at length, beyond observing that the high court made clear that a \u201cjust\u201d resolution to a case does also involve questions of speed and efficiency in the sense of minimum delay and expense. the high court observed that these things are essential to a just resolution to proceedings. a party should be given a proper opportunity to plead their case, but limits may be imposed on a party\u2019s right to re-plead their case in the event that they leave it too late or conduct their case in such an inefficient manner as to create real prejudice to the administration of justice. 33 the days have long gone when the parties conduct litigation and the judges adopt an entirely passive observer role. courts are expected to, consistent with the objects and principles of their enabling acts, administer justice in a timely and efficient manner. the australian public demands no less, particularly in this court where emotions sometimes get the better of people and many families wait anxiously for a day in court relating to children. 34 this is not such a case, but i highlight that what has happened here, is that there was another trial which had to be adjourned because of this case. so that other family has had to take an alternative hearing date next year. these are exactly the considerations that the high court identified in aon risk (supra). 35 and it is certainly not the case that a party who wishes to amend their pleadings or their evidence or to seek joinder in this case, can expect that simply by paying a costs order that they will get the adjournment they seek. it is always a discretionary matter. 36 in this particular case, however, the discretion in my view favours the granting of the adjournment and the making of the orders that i\u2019ve indicated. i say that because the husband is under a legal disability. he is at a great disadvantage in that sense. it is clear to me from the submissions made, quite appropriately by mr bateman, that whatever slip or error occurred cannot realistically be sheeted home to the husband. i simply do not see how that could be so. and if it is submitted or contended that the litigation guardian gave instructions not to join the trustees, or not to pursue a section 106b application, then it seems to me that those instructions could never logically have been accepted by the husband\u2019s legal representatives. put shortly, his case for a share of the estate was doomed if he took that position. 37 so sitting here, i do not realistically see how the litigation guardian could be at fault for what has occurred here. indeed it seems to me, from everything submitted to me, that the error (or problem) in the conduct of the case very much arises by the litigation guardian\u2019s and husband\u2019s legal representatives. 38 the \u201cprice\u201d of this trial being adjourned is almost certainly a costs order and one would think almost certainly an indemnity costs order, given the conduct of the matter. 39 it would be entirely unfair of me today to hear an application for indemnity costs quite properly brought by the wife against counsel and a solicitor who have not had the opportunity to provide the court with submissions and to be heard. there may also be relevant insurance issues, as evidenced by the fact that mr moran now appears on behalf of mr paton today. it is not a case where the husband\u2019s legal representatives are accepting or admitting a liability to pay costs. there is no concession made but i make clear that i see the making of a costs order against one or both of the legal representatives as highly likely on the next occasion. 40 this trial is being adjourned through no fault of the wife. if the husband is ultimately unsuccessful at his trial in terms of his claim against the estate, the fact is that the wife has limited prospects of recovering from him any costs that she may incur. in that sense, the husband does not have the financial means to be able to meet the costs order. this is another factor, combined with delay, which causes me great concern. the circumstances of the case are somewhat unusual, the husband being under a disability. 41 it seems to me that in the interests of justice, it is a better and more appropriate exercise of my discretion, to give the husband the adjournment he seeks on the - i would think fairly clear understanding - that i will be making a costs order on the next occasion. there is a price to an adjournment, and it seems to me that in this case, absent some most extraordinary circumstance that i cannot presently imagine, that price is going to have to be paid. 42 there is also a separate question that has arisen in relation to a subpoena directed to mr d. that is a relatively small issue in the grand scheme of things but any costs application in that regard can also be dealt with on the next occasion. 43 for these reasons, i propose to make the orders that i have earlier identified. associate: dated: 5 november 2021", "metadata": {"filename": "99.txt",

i asked her, \u201cdo you understand the consequence if you sign this agreement?\u201d...and she said she understood, but she has to sign, because if she refused (to) sign he will not marry her. she will lose her permanent resident entitlement.\u201d i told her that my job is to provide independent legal advice. i need to ensure she is willing to enter into this agreement, not by force, not by coerce. \u201ci did not give her advice that she should not sign...as long as she was willing to sign...she can sign as long as she was aware of the consequence of signing the agreement.\u201d legal principles ... there are different ways to prove the existence of undue influence. one method of proof is by direct evidence of the circumstances of the particular transaction...another way in which undue influence can be proved is by presumption.... a presumption, in the sense used here, arises where common experience is that the existence of one fact means that another fact also exists. common experience gives rise to a presumption that a transaction was not the exercise of a person\u2019s free will if (i) the person is proved to be in a particular relationship, and (ii) the transaction is one, commonly involving a \u201csubstantial benefit\u201d to another, which cannot be explained by \u201cordinary motives\u201d, or \u201cis not readily explicable by the relationship of the parties\u201d. although the classes are not closed, in johnson v buttress latham cj described the relationships that could give rise to the presumption as including parent and child, guardian and ward, trustee and beneficiary, solicitor and client, physician and patient, and cases of religious influence.

(the court observes that the wife did not obtain australian permanent residency status until 2016). indeed, in late 2013 she had told mr q that if she did not sign the agreement the husband would not marry her and she \u201cmay have to go back to india because (the husband) may not sponsor me any more with the partner visa\u201d. moreover, the wife had told mr q in late 2013 that she had no option but to sign the agreement and had told him that she had \u201cno choice\u201d and that she had to sign the agreement, \u201cotherwise i won\u2019t be married.\u201d and this belief of the wife persisted in the face of mr q\u2019s advices to the wife that there were distinct disadvantages to the wife in entering into the agreement and that she did not have to sign the agreement. the court observes that after the agreement was signed the husband told the wife that now he could get married to her, (c) the wife had had no time for careful reflection in relation to the contents of the agreement prior to late 2013, the wife had not seen the agreement prior to late 2013, (d) the wife had met mr q for the first time in late 2013, she had received his advices for the first time on that date, and had signed the agreement before mr q immediately following his advices to her in relation to the agreement. effectively, she had had no sufficient time to reflect upon mr q\u2019s advices in relation to the agreement. the above statement by the husband to the wife (that is, if she did not sign the agreement he would not marry her) had a significant impact upon her and likely operated upon her mind up to and including late 2013. namely, by late 2013 when the wife signed the agreement before mr q, this statement by the husband to the wife had led her to believe that if she did not sign the agreement the husband would not marry her and she may have to return to india because the husband might not sponsor her anymore in relation to her partner visa.

marry her and she \u201cmay have to go back to india because (the husband) may not sponsor me any more with the partner visa\u201d. moreover, the wife had told mr q in late 2013 that she had no option but to sign the agreement and had told him that she had \u201cno choice\u201d and that she had to sign the agreement, \u201cotherwise i won\u2019t be married.\u201d and this belief of the wife persisted in the face of mr q\u2019s advices to the wife that there were distinct disadvantages to the wife in entering into the agreement and that she did not have to sign the agreement. the court observes that after the agreement was signed the husband told the wife that now he could get married to her, (c) the wife had had no time for careful reflection in relation to the contents of the agreement prior to late 2013, the wife had not seen the agreement prior to late 2013, (d) the wife had met mr q for the first time in late 2013, she had received his advices for the first time on that date, and had signed the agreement before mr q immediately following his advices to her in relation to the agreement. effectively, she had had no sufficient time to reflect upon mr q\u2019s advices in relation to the agreement. the wife had had no time for careful reflection in relation to the contents of the agreement prior to late 2013, the wife had not seen the agreement prior to late 2013, (d)

had received his advices for the first time on that date, and had signed the agreement before mr q immediately following his advices to her in relation to the agreement. effectively, she had had no sufficient time to reflect upon mr q\u2019s advices in relation to the agreement. in this context, prior to late 2013 the husband had told the wife that his lawyer had prepared the agreement and she needed to sign it. on or about late 2013 he had told her that the agreement was ready and she would have to sign it. when the wife asked the husband why she had to go see a lawyer in relation to the agreement, the husband told her that the lawyer would have to explain the document that he had signed and \u201cthen you sign\u201d, (e) in 2013 (but prior to late 2013) the husband had told the wife that he wanted to marry her subject to her signing the agreement. the husband asserts that the parties were engaged in india in 2012. the agreement, in recital d, refers to the parties intending to marry in 2013, (f) the husband, at the time of the parties entering into the agreement, had net assets of about $470,000 whereas the wife had net assets of $5,000. at this time the husband was employed as a professional and the wife was unemployed. again, the wife believed that if she did not sign the agreement, the husband would not marry her and she might have to return to india because of her australian immigration status. if the wife had to return to india, there was a real prospect that she would live with her elderly parents there and support and assist them as she did prior to the relationship, (g) the independent legal advice that mr q gave to the wife effectively included advice that in the event of the parties\u2019 separation, the wife would not be able to claim on the husband\u2019s \u201cseparate property\u201d referred to in the agreement notwithstanding what happened during the marriage, and the wife would not be able to bring a claim for property settlement \u201cfor a share of your husband\u2019s assets\u201d in the event of separation. despite this advice, and her apparent understanding of it, the wife signed the agreement, (h) the court would assess that the agreement was not fair or reasonable to the wife. in 2013 (but prior to late 2013) the husband had told the wife that he wanted to marry her subject to her signing the agreement. the husband

would assess that the agreement was not fair or reasonable to the wife. the court would assess that the agreement was not fair or reasonable to the wife. the court observes that under the proposed agreement not only would the wife not be able to claim on the husband\u2019s \u201cseparate property\u201d referred to in the agreement (see annexure a to the agreement) in the event of separation, but should the husband acquire property in his own name during the relationship (which in fact the husband did, namely he acquired the e street, suburb f property in 2017) such property would effectively remain the property of the husband: see clause 3(b) (\u201cjoint property is all property which is not defined as separate property as per paragraph 2 herein\u201d), clause 4(b) (\u201cany property acquired...by the parties shall be recorded in writing or by title documentation to be the asset...of one or other or both of them\u201d), and clause 6(b) (\u201cjoint property will be divided between them in accordance with their entitlements as evidenced in writing or title documentation...\u201d), accordingly, by entering into the agreement, not only would the wife be unable to bring to account a contribution to the husband\u2019s \u201cseparate property\u201d as set out in the agreement, but she would be unable to bring to account a contribution to the husband\u2019s property acquired in his name during their relationship, and she would be unable to bring to account a contribution as homemaker made during their relationship. \u201ci told her that my job is to provide independent legal advice. i need to ensure she is willing to enter into this agreement, not by force, not by coerce.\u201d unconscionable conduct causation that she had no option but to sign the agreement, (b) that if she did not sign the agreement the husband would not marry her and she may have to go back to india because the husband may not sponsor her anymore with the partner visa, (c) that she had no choice and had to sign the agreement otherwise she would not be married, and, (d) that she wanted to sign the agreement despite mr q telling her that she did not have to sign the agreement, that if she did not sign the agreement the husband would not marry her and she may have to go back to india because the husband may not sponsor her anymore with the partner visa, (c) that she had no choice and had to sign the agreement otherwise she would not be married, and, (d) that she wanted to sign the agreement despite mr q telling her that she did not have to sign the agreement,

agreement, that she wanted to sign the agreement despite mr q telling her that she did not have to sign the agreement, with the wife, according to mr q, then proceeding to sign the agreement, the court would infer that the wife\u2019s above statements to mr q (that is, that the agreement was just a piece of paper and it didn\u2019t bother her) were likely made to mr q at some stage prior to the wife asking mr q to explain the consequences of her signing the agreement (see the opening lines of paragraph 20 of mr q\u2019s affidavit) and prior to the wife\u2019s statements to mr q in

\"[t]he court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. section 79(4) prescribes matters that must be taken into account in considering what order (if any) should be made under the section. the requirements of the two sub-sections are not to be conflated. in every case in which a property

possible to chart its metes and bounds.\u201d [footnotes omitted] firstly, in order to ascertain whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order, it is necessary to identify the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. the high court emphasised the word \u2018existing\u2019. secondly, although s.79 gives the court a broad power to make property settlement orders it may not be exercised in an unprincipled fashion. there must be no assumption that the parties\u2019 interests are or should be different to their existing interests. thirdly, when considering whether making a property settlement order is just and equitable the court must not assume that one or the other party has the right to a property adjustment order. the court must give

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 7 august 2023 federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2) fadel & gibbons [2023] fedcfamc2f 679 orders the court orders that: allowing the child to come into any form of contact with mr e, being the mother\u2019s current partner, (b) allowing the child to come into contact with the mother if they are of the belief that she is under the influence of either illicit substances and/or alcohol. allowing the child to come into contact with the mother if they are of the belief that she is under the influence of either illicit substances and/or alcohol. reasons for judgment judge street undefended hearing against the first respondent \u201ca respondent who merely wishes to ask the court to dismiss the appellant\u2019s application (and seeks no other order) and who wishes to place no evidence before the court, but who wishes to submit that the application should be dismissed even on the applicant\u2019s evidence, is certainly not obliged by the rules to file any answer or affidavit, but only a notice of address for service. however, if such a respondent then attends the hearing and in fact makes no submissions against the application (as the husband did in this case) then, in anyone\u2019s language, the application is \u2018undefended\u2019 or \u2018unopposed\u2019. unlike some other jurisdictions, such a circumstance does not and cannot lead, in this court, to a \u2018judgment by default\u2019 in favour of the applicant, because the court must still decide, on the evidence before it, that the applicant is entitled, in law, to the relief claimed and that, in the exercise of its discretion, it is appropriate to grant that relief. nevertheless, the proceedings in such a case are clearly \u2018undefended\u2019, and it would be a misuse of language to describe them otherwise. they certainly could not be described as \u2018defended\u2019.\u201d chronology documents relied upon affidavit of mr fadel filed 29 may 2023, affidavit of ms b haneen filed 4 may 2023, (b) affidavit of mr c haneen filed 4 may 2023, affidavit of mr c haneen filed 4 may 2023, evidence parenting principles the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility best interests of the child ...no doubt in the majority of cases, there will be a positive benefit for the child having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent, if this would not be in the child\u2019s best interests. ... having a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child\u2019s best interests. there is no legislative definition of \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d but for there to be a meaningful relationship, it must be healthy, worthwhile and advantageous to the child. (emphasis added) and that desirability only operates when there is a chance of a meaningful relationship, which is beneficial to the child. it is not, in other words, a question of contact for contact sake. if there is a situation where contact with a parent is, on balance, likely to cause more harm to the child than good, or even is not likely to confer any benefit, then little purpose is served by this court making orders for such contact. that does not detract from the desirability of the child having a meaningful relationship, but the possibility of a meaningful relationship must first exist. (emphasis added) issue of risk 138. the assessment of risk is a predictive exercise and while it is, naturally enough, liable to be influenced by factual findings about past events, the contemplation of risk entails the foresight of possible harm. it is an oddity to expect that the mere possibility of future harm can or should be proven as a probability, as has been implied before (potter and potter [2007] famca 350, (2007) flc 93-326 at [110], [129]). risks of harm must be heeded even if they are improbable eventualities. 139. speaking of the risk of some future occurrence is just another way of expressing the chance of it happening. the concept of chance lies along a continuum, encompassing all outcomes which lie in the range between highly probable and remotely possible, assuming the polar extremes of certainty are ignored. in the current context, the higher the chance of the children\u2019s sexual abuse, the greater the risk of their physical or psychological harm. at some point on the continuum the risk of such harm becomes so potent it cannot be tolerated: it is unacceptable. ... 142. as was recognised by hale lj (as her ladyship then was) in re c and b (children) (care order: future harm) [2001] 1 f.l.r 611 at [28], in child-related proceedings, a comparatively small risk of really serious harm can justify action, while even the virtual certainty of slight harm might not. it could hardly be otherwise, because no prudent adult would willingly expose a child to the risk of sexual abuse when there is an unacceptably high chance of its occurrence, even though the chance is not proven by the evidence to be probable. requiring the proof of any possible future child abuse as a probability would pervert the law as settled by the high court in m v m and malec. (emphasis in the original) it is now well established that \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d includes not merely physical harm but also includes an assessment of the risk of emotional harm: see a v a [1998] famca 25, (1998) flc 92-800 at 84,996, m v m (1988) 166 clr 69 at 77. (b) such an unacceptable risk can include any or all matters that compromise the safety, welfare and well-being of a child, and is examined in light of an accumulation of factors proved: see director general, department of family and community services (nsw) and the colt children [2013] nswchc 5 at [146]\u2013[148]. (c) the components which lead to a conclusion that an unacceptable risk exists need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d from the accumulation of factors, none or only some of which are proved to that standard: see johnson & page [2007] famca 1235, (2007) flc 93-344 at [68], endorsing and applying the principles set out in a paper prepared by the hon john fogarty am, \u201cunacceptable risk: a return to basics\u201d (2006) 20 australian journal of family law 249.

impact of its contents on our client\u2019s appropriateness to play a parenting role in the children\u2019s lives, regretfully means that our client has no confidence in your ability to now ignore the contents of that affidavit in the conduct of this matter moving forward. as you are aware, in your role you must remain impartial in order to properly discharge your obligation as the independent children\u2019s lawyer. we have therefore been instructed to request that you voluntarily recuse yourself and cease acting as independent children\u2019s lawyer in this matter. the decision of our client to instruct us to make this request has not been made lightly. our client must, however, have confidence in the independent children\u2019s lawyer\u2019s role given the importance of the matters at stake in these proceedings. documents relied upon orders sought legal principles a number of authorities have considered the removal of an independent children's lawyer, and specifically, the circumstances which may justify such a course. from those, the following points may be discerned: it is not inconsistent with the independent and professional discharge of an independent children's lawyer\u2019s obligations for her or him to advocate that a particular course of action adverse to, or inconsistent with, the position of a party, ought be taken by the court,[6] whilst in a unique position, the independent children's lawyer owes the same professional obligations to the court as does any licenced legal practitioner,[7] on occasion, the independent children's lawyer will be in an invidious position, but nonetheless they should be no less courageous, no less firm and no less cogent, in advocating for results or findings,[8] inevitably the role of the independent children's lawyer involves an exercise of professional judgment which may, on occasion, be precarious and difficult,[9] it is not appropriate for a litigant to endeavour to micro-manage the independent children's lawyer, or critique every step that they take,[10] it is certainly not the case that, even if an independent children's lawyer does make a mistake, the court will necessarily accede to an application to have them discharged. significantly more than that is required,[11] it is inevitable that the high standards of competence which the court expects of independent children's lawyers are not always met. independent children's lawyers are, like anybody, liable to human frailty,[12] a court should be slow to discharge an independent children's lawyer on the basis of largely unsubstantiated complaints of one of the parties.[13] alleged bias like so many matters in this court, it will, in my opinion, be a matter of considering the evidence presented on each application for the discharge of an independent children\u2019s lawyer to determine if the evidence demonstrates sufficient lack of objectivity and professionalism on the part of the independent children\u2019s lawyer such as to justify his or her discharge. the mere appearance of partiality to a particular party\u2019s position will not necessarily suffice as to warrant the independent children\u2019s lawyer\u2019s removal. parents who are involved in litigation in this court about their children need to understand that as part of his or her role, the independent children\u2019s lawyer may legitimately and responsibly say things that are challenging and confronting to the parent in respect of his or her views about parenting and the best interests of his or her children in the particular circumstances of the case, but that does not necessarily mean that the independent children\u2019s lawyer is not acting in accordance with his or her duties in the case.[20] the test that i shall apply is that the father needs to establish that the independent children's lawyer actually lacks impartiality or alternatively, a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children's lawyer lacks impartiality. that test of perceived lack of impartiality however, is to be judged having regard to the role and duties imposed upon the independent children's lawyer by s 68la of the act. that \u201crubric\u201d is discussed by murphy j at [41] \u2013 [61] of knibbs where his honour sets out, amongst other things, the duty of the independent children's lawyer to argue firmly and fearlessly for what the independent children's lawyer contends are findings or results consistent with the best interests of particular children and describes the precarious position an independent children's lawyer is in when fulfilling that role because it may be that the independent children's lawyer is required to challenge the position of one or other of the parents.[22] ...in relation to an independent children\u2019s lawyer the appearance of bias may be tested by whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the independent children\u2019s lawyer might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the task of independently representing a child.[24] the husband could not rely on any actual perception of bias by himself as distinct from the perception of some hypothetical person. while a child\u2019s representative should be removed if there a proper reasons for doing so, it would be quite wrong for court to remove a child\u2019s representative merely because a litigant has taken a view that the child\u2019s representative is acting contrary to that litigant\u2019s position (or from the litigant\u2019s point of view) contrary to the child\u2019s best interests.[26] it was a critical question whether a person in the husband\u2019s position might reasonably believe that the child\u2019s representative would not be impartial, but would be prejudiced against the husband by reason of his association with the former judge.[27] the critical question in considering an application to remove a child\u2019s representative is whether the representative is likely to carry out his or her task properly. it is not necessary to attempt to state generally the circumstances that might cause the court to find that child representative is unlikely to do so.[28] ...it has been established by a serious of decisions of this court that the test to be applied in australia in determining whether a judge is disqualified by reason of the appearance of bias (which, in the present case, was said to take the form of pre-judgement) is whether a fair minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial or unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide.[31] conclusion costs associate: dated: 6 june 2023 dated: 6 june 2023 [1]
