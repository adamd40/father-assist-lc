[x] needs to try and have a good opportunity to have as normalised a relationship as possible with his father. associate: dated: 29 august 2023 dated: 29 august 2023 [1] particularised in exhibit a3.

upon standard of proof the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to indefinite gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by the law for various purposes. fortunately, however, at common law no third standard of persuasion was definitely developed. except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. property adjustment: the law property proceedings under part viii and the approach in hickey and stanford identify the

purchasing a home, paying it off, acquiring other assets with the overall object of attaining a higher standard of living. the reported decisions in respect of applications for settlement of property under sec. 79 of the act are unanimous hat both parties should share the economic fruits of a marriage, having regard to the provisions of sec. 79(4) and sec. 75(2), although not necessarily equally.[15] to date, three clear categories of cases have emerged where the court has determined that it is appropriate to notionally add back to the pool of assets, that is, assets that no longer exist. they are: where the parties have expended money on legal fees. in djm and jlm (1998) flc 92\u2014816 the full court said at 85,262: for reasons set out in farnell, s 117 provides that each party to proceedings under the family law act shall bear their own costs unless the court otherwise orders. failing to add back monies expended by parties on costs frequently has the effect of defeating the policy of s 117 by permitting the pool of available assets for distribution between the parties to be diminished by any monies that either of the parties have managed to spend on their costs up to the date of trial. we are of the view that the normal approach ought be to add costs already paid back into the pool. whilst there may be cases where that approach is inappropriate, the reasons why it is not taken ought normally be spelt out. (b) where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend (1995) flc 92\u2014569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654: where there has been a premature distribution of matrimonial assets. in townsend and townsend (1995) flc 92\u2014569 nicholson cj as he then was with whom fogarty and jordan jj agreed, said at 81,654: in my view, what occurred in this case, as i said during the course of argument was, in fact, a premature distribution of a proportion of the matrimonial assets. what the husband did was to distribute to himself an asset in which the wife had a legitimate interest. in such circumstances i consider that it would be unjust in the extreme to simply treat such conduct by the husband as a matter to which regard should be had under section 75(2). it seems to me that the husband has had the benefit of that money. had he retained, for example, the taxi licence instead of selling it, that would have been brought into account as an item of property which would have been dealt with in the same way as the remaining items of property in this case. accordingly, i am of the view that the correct way in which to deal with the husband\u2019s receipt of those moneys is to bring them into the pool of assets on a notional basis and make a distribution accordingly. in the circumstances outlined by baker j in kowaliw and kowaliw (1981) flc 91\u2014092 at 76,644: as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: (a) where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[20] where one of the parties has embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[20] where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value.[20] whilst not seeking to place a fetter upon the exercise of a trial judge in individual cases, it seems to us that the concept of adding monies reasonably disposed of back into the pool ought to be the exception rather than the rule. the parties are entitled to reasonably conduct their affairs post-separation in a manner that is consistent with properly getting on with their lives. providing modest support for their adult children or taking not inappropriate holidays for themselves seems to fit comfortably within that description.[23] the parties' positions based on the asset pool as determined by reference to the parties\u2019 existing legal and equitable property interests, is it just and equitable to make an order pursuant to s 79? section 79(4)(a)\u2013(c) \u2014 assessment of contributions it was not in dispute that the primary judge applied proper principle in determining that the assessment of the impact of the husband's initial contributions could only properly occur after she assessed \"the totality of the parties' contribution\u2014based entitlement over the entirety of the marriage and post-separation\" (at [210]). in that respect, in pierce v pierce (1999) flc 92\u2014844 (\"pierce\"), the full court stated at [28]: ...it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. (emphasis added) to similar effect, in cabbell & cabbell [2009] famcafc 205, the full court stated at [54] that in considering the parties' contributions, it is necessary to trace the use of those assets and consider the foundation that they laid for the subsequent accumulation of wealth by the parties. that is, in evaluating the parties' contributions, it was necessary for the primary judge to have regard to the context of the husband's initial contribution and specifically, to the opportunity that initial contribution created and the impact of that initial contribution on the subsequent wealth of the parties as at the date of the hearing. (emphasis added) section 79(4)(a): direct financial contributions section 79(4)(b): direct and indirect non-financial contributions to property section 79(4)(c): contributions to the welfare of the family, including contributions as homemaker or parent conclusion regarding the parties\u2019 contributions section 79(4)(d)\u2013(g), including s 75(2) \u2014 other factors conclusion regarding the division of parties\u2019 non-superannuation net assets. final assessment: a just and equitable exercise of discretion? ... that exercise is not done in isolation, it is done against the background of conclusions already arrived at on contributions, the consequence of which will be in some cases to intrude into the s 75(2) exercise because of the dimension of the former conclusion and the total pool. it is largely for that reason that it is ultimately necessary to stand back from the process and reach a conclusion which appears overall to be a just and equitable exercise of the discretion.[51] associate: dated: 29 august 2023 dated: 29 august 2023 [1] order of an sjr, in pfeiffer & pfeiffer (federal circuit and family court of australia, lnc123/2022), 7 june 2022.[2] affidavit of mr pfeiffer, filed 15 august 2023 [263] (\u2018husband\u2019s affidavit\u2019). it is unclear as to whether the spousal maintenance order was discharged.[3] order of judge turnbull, in pfeiffer & pfeiffer (federal circuit and family court of australia, lnc123/2022), 22 august 2023.

supervision between [early] and [mid]-2020, since those orders on 3 september 2020, you have not attended one changeover?\u2011\u2011\u2011that\u2019s correct. his honour: why is that?\u2011\u2011\u2011the hostility that could evolve between me and [mr grover] is real, and i am in counselling. i have been in counselling since i have left. the only reason that, your honour, i was present during those initial stages was because there was little and limited opportunity financially. i was still on maternity leave. i had not even returned to work. i was still in the family home and i had a one year old. i obviously did not want [x] not to see her father, but i needed to do it in a way that i could achieve with the circumstances i had before me. yes. no, i understand that historically, but do you still \u2011 \u2011 \u2011?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 have the same issues or concerns today?\u2011\u2011\u2011absolutely. very much so. handover is not an option, and i will not be putting myself or [x] or [mr grover] and his new family at any risk. if [x] is available and made available for her visitation in a safe way, a productive way, a way that doesn\u2019t have [x] see her parents, you know, involved in any conflict, me crying or upset or \u2013 i don\u2019t want that for [x] at all. i don\u2019t want that for me in my recovery and progress. i don\u2019t want that for [mr grover], either. so how much longer do you say you are likely to be so anxious or concerned about changeovers that you don\u2019t plan on being present at them?\u2011\u2011\u2011your honour, i think with time and the situation i\u2019ve proposed in the move to queensland, i absolutely feel that in the future \u2013 that i could make that \u2013 you know, those arrangements happen, and i think with proximity, you know, being a factor, you know, when that is removed and exchanges could be perhaps less frequent, they could become productive and the relationship, with time, i am hoping, could improve, but that is a longer term, i think. so \u2011 \u2011 \u2011?\u2011\u2011\u2011not impossible and not improbable and not the goal, but longer term. so let me put a difficult scenario to you. okay? your parents move to queensland \u2011 \u2011 \u2011?\u2011\u2011\u2011absolutely, your honour. \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 and i make a decision that it\u2019s not in [x]\u2019s best interest to relocate with you to queensland. okay? that\u2019s one of a number of possibilities, right?\u2011\u2011\u2011okay. so what\u2019s going to happen with the changeovers if you\u2019re still in [city b] with [x]? you still want to, and i accept that you will, as far as you can \u2013 you will, pardon me, promote and do all things necessary to facilitate [x]\u2019s relationship with her dad?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. what\u2019s going to happen about changeovers?\u2011\u2011\u2011perhaps, some more structure would need to be put in place than is current. so what does that mean?\u2011\u2011\u2011i might need, you know, a support person or somebody to assist, you know, or come with, or we had discussed \u2013 the lawyer had discussed a police station or some other safe venue that would provide less worry for risk. yes, the \u2013 you know, that \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 but it\u2019s alleged risk and worry for you, not for [x], correct?\u2011\u2011\u2011i think [x] has already been exposed, unfortunately, to a little bit. it\u2019s less with my mum doing it than it would be with me. i don\u2019t think there\u2019s any contest that me and [mr grover] have \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 issues?\u2011\u2011\u2011 \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 the potential for that. yes, and i don\u2019t \u2013 you know, because there has \u2013 because i\u2019ve avoided that exposure, that obviously hasn\u2019t come to the front, and you know, i\u2019ve even left \u2013 [city b]is such a small place. you know, when i turn up to [the] park or something and they\u2019re there, i leave, and i literally go to the extent of calling the police, telling them i\u2019m leaving the event, and then, i go home to avoid the conflict. avoiding it is, you know, obviously something that i\u2019ve been doing, but that\u2019s not ideal. my oldest daughter has been missing out on some things and, you know, it\u2019s not just [x]. it\u2019s my oldest as well that feels the brunt of that protective state that is real. it\u2019s very unfortunate, but it\u2019s there. and you\u2019re still \u2013 you\u2019re still seeking professional assistance, yes?\u2011\u2011\u2011absolutely, yes. pc: painful [limb]... ... grandmother was contacted by [ms l] at 1730 that [x] had ?

[mr grover] was drunk a lot when we were married. no. i want to suggest he didn\u2019t, and, indeed, my client has undertaken both drug and alcohol urinalysis, and you agree with me that those results came back negative?\u2011\u2011\u2011absolutely, yes. and, indeed, equally he did a hair drug follicle test. that also came back negative?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. maternal grandmother\u2019s oral evidence respondent father\u2019s oral evidence father\u2019s partner\u2019s oral evidence some procedural matters ms swart: your honour, can i just answer your honour\u2019s questions now, having had that little break to do that \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: thank you. ms swart: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 and get those instructions. if something were to happen to the grandparents and they were incapacitated in some way and not moving to queensland, question 1, my client would not move to queensland without them. if they did move to queensland but then something happened and they were not able to provide practical support to her in queensland and she\u2019s already there, would she stay, the answer is yes. and would we appreciate a preliminary view from your honour, the answer is yes. his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 to the [deacon] ladies at the back of the court, in particular. to state the obvious reality, at some stage all of us are going to die. and if anything untoward \u2013 and this has been put to the parties \u2013 if anything was to happen to one or either of [ms deacon]\u2019s parents and therefore especially say if something happened to her mother, would [ms deacon] \u2013 [x]\u2019s mother \u2013 could it be the case that she becomes so distraught and lacking in support that could impact upon her parenting ability for [x]?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. i imagine that it could, but i am aware that i\u2019m looking at that through a particular lens of, you know, my cultural background of what i view as a normal adult/child relationship with a parent and that there are different family structures where \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 no. i understand \u2011 \u2011 \u2011?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 all that. i understand all that?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. no, get that?\u2011\u2011\u2011so, you know, i do think there is always a risk if \u2013 particularly for a parent if a parent is reliant \u2013 has only one source of support that they\u2019re reliant on. or a primary support?\u2011\u2011\u2011or \u2013 yes \u2013 one primary support and they find it difficult to access other supports, then that is a risk and that\u2019s the same whether that one support is their partner or their parent or their psychologist. if that is the only support and it\u2019s very difficult for them to find and rely on other supports when needed, then that does place a lot of pressure on that relationship and place \u2013 there\u2019s a risk there if something happens to that relationship. this might be more of a theoretical question, but obviously answer whatever way you think best. could it ever get to the stage where an adult child is in a co-dependent relationship with their parent beyond whatever \u2013 you know, however you describe it, as just an ordinary parent/child relationship?\u2011\u2011\u2011i think the \u2013 the word co-dependent is a tricky one. if \u2013 in terms of that sort of enmeshed relationship where it really is a problematic dynamic, yes, absolutely that can happen. i think signs of that would be things like a very volatile dynamic between the individuals, and a sense of control. so one person making all of the decisions, lack of \u2013 lack of financial independence, lack of capacity for that person to have other relationships with friends or other, you know, romantic partners, and things like that, would be signs that it\u2019s probably more in that enmeshed dynamic \u2013 sort of tricky dynamic rather than a healthy support. evidence of ms g and her relationships [x] (aged 3 years) [x] was neatly dressed, and appeared cheerful and confident during the observation sessions. she spoke clearly, and could generally be understood, making some articulation mistakes common at her stage of development. [ms deacon reported that [x] has been diagnosed with [a medical condition] \u2013 a group of disorders. these disorders affect individuals differently, and to varying extents. [mr grover] believes that [x] was incorrectly diagnosed and reported that he has a letter from the genetic specialist confirming that [x] does not have [a medical condition]. observations of interactions [x] entered the observation room cheerfully with her mother and maternal grandmother, and immediately showed interest in the toys available. she chatted with her mother about the toys and her mother engaged in an interested manner, asking about the toys, and inviting [x] to look at particular toys. [ms deacon] offered appropriate assistance for [x], and praised [x], saying \u201coh very clever. you are very good in the kitchen.... you\u2019re so clever and smart\u201d. [ms deacon] encouraged [x] to pack away one set of toys before opening a new toy, and [x] complied with this request, helping to pack away the toys. when the light switched off suddenly, [x] said to her mother, \u201coh scary! it\u2019s dark!\u201d [ms deacon] comforted [x], saying, \u201cit\u2019s ok. do you want a cuddle?\u201d later, when the light went off again, [x] showed no distress, saying, \u201cmaybe it\u2019s \u2018lectricity\u201d. [ms deacon] joined in [x]\u2019s imaginative play, and allowed [x] to lead the play. the maternal grandmother sat quietly watching [x] play. at the end of the observation session, [x] asked her mother, \u201cwhere are you going? i want to go too\u201d. [ms deacon] explained that she needed to go home to [x]\u2019s sister, and encouraged [x] to show her father her toys and her special medal that she had brought with her. when [mr grover], [ms e] and [f] entered the room, [x] gave her father a hug, and then showed him her medal. [x] then hugged [f], who grinned and giggled at [x]. [x] engaged cheerfully and enthusiastically with her father, and showed the assessor her water bottle, saying \u201cdaddy choosed this one! i love the bottle that daddy choosed!\u201d [mr grover] brought a variety of snacks for [x], including fruit, chips, and a lollipop, as well as a range of toys, including playdough and books. [x] requested that her father help her with tasks, such as removing playdough shapes from the cutouts, and offered her father a lollipop. [mr grover] praised [x]\u2019s manners, and encouraged her to eat her fruit prior to having a lollipop. while [ms e] mostly focused on [f] during the observation session, she chatted with [x], and [x] engaged happily with her, and asked [ms e] to assist her. [mr grover] encouraged [x] to help pack away toys, and [x] said to him, \u201cyou tidy up and i\u2019ll play\u201d. [x] and her father were not observed packing away the toys, and this occurred during [ms e]\u2019s interview. evaluation based on [x]\u2019s developmental stage, the priorities for her are to have: a safe and stable home environment, warm, emotionally sensitive relationships with her caregivers, opportunities for meaningful relationships with both her parents, and to connect with other family members, and a child-focused routine with opportunities for free play and early learning. [x] has been described as a happy and bubbly three-year-old by both her parents, and is reported to be thriving developmentally. during the observation sessions, she interacted in a cheerful, engaging manner with each of her parents, and no developmental concerns were noted. [ms deacon] believes [x]\u2019s eczema and asthma are symptoms of an underlying genetic condition [...] which has affected [x]\u2019s [physical] development. [ms deacon] has sought testing and treatment from medical professionals to address these issues. [mr grover] believes that [x] has undergone unnecessary medical examinations, and that there are no indications that [x] has this condition. he is also concerned that [ms deacon] has posted photos of [x] to public online forums. the dispute between the parents has clearly caused difficulty for [x]\u2019streating medical professionals, who have received different information from each of the parents, and they appear caught up in the dispute. it is highly concerning if [ms deacon] has misreported or fabricated [x]\u2019s symptoms, in an effort to gain a diagnosis for [x]. however, there do not appear to be indications of seeing an unnecessary number of medical professionals, and it seems that she has followed medical advice to seek out specialist care. it seems likely that, due to [ms deacon]\u2019s concerns about [mr grover], that she has attempted to minimise his involvement in [x]\u2019s medical appointments, which has limited the information available to [x]\u2019s treating professionals, particularly in relation to genetic testing. however, it is also concerning if, as [ms deacon] has alleged, [mr grover] has downplayed [x]\u2019s symptoms and his own medical history when speaking with her treating team. it is highly likely that the parents\u2019 dispute about [x]\u2019s medical needs will disrupt the medical care that she is able to receive, and could have a negative psychological impact on [x]. both parents have alleged that the other parent displayed a pattern of volatility and aggression during the relationship, which at times escalated to physical violence. if [x] was exposed to family violence between her parents, it may have had lasting negative effects on her cognitive, emotional, and social development, and impacted her relationships with her caregivers. neither parent raised current concerns about [x] displaying symptoms of trauma. however, [ms deacon] reported that [d] has more memories of the violence prior to the parents\u2019 separation, and experiences ongoing fear of [mr grover]. [mr grover] has raised concerns about [ms deacon]\u2019s volatility and aggression towards him, the children, and her own parents. he believes that this volatility is underpinned by her anxiety, and described her as a quiet and gentle individual at times that she is not overwhelmed by her emotions. [ms deacon] reported that she has engaged in counselling to address her anxiety, and does not believe that her anxiety has a negative effect on her parenting or her relationships with others. she and her mother, [ms c], described an amicable, supportive relationship with one another, and did not indicate significant conflict between them, as alleged by [mr grover]. [ms deacon]\u2019s refusal to attend handovers and her responses to [x] being injured when in [mr grover]\u2019s care, could be an indication that her anxiety continues to interfere with her capacity to co-parent with [mr grover]. however, as [ms deacon] has pointed out, if she was a victim of sustained family violence and control perpetrated by [mr grover], it is reasonable that she would remain vigilant about [x] being harmed in his care, and be unwilling to engage with him directly. [ms deacon] was recently convicted of [offences], relating to incidents between her and [mr grover] during their relationship. [ms deacon] has reported that she retaliated against [mr grover]\u2019s ongoing violence towards her, but accepts responsibility for her behaviour. she believes that [mr grover] made reports to police in late 2021, as retaliation for her allegations that [ms e] was stalking her, and that he was attempting to use the allegations as a way to gain care of [x]. if the court finds that [ms deacon]\u2019s volatility and aggression poses a risk to [x], it may be beneficial for [ms deacon] to engage in further psychological treatment. [mr grover] is concerned at level of involvement that [ms deacon]\u2019s mother has had in [x] and [d]\u2019s lives. however, it appears that, while [ms c] has been significantly involved in the children\u2019s lives, and offers a great deal of support to her daughter, there are no indications that this is detrimental to [x]\u2019s wellbeing. [ms c] appears to have played a positive role in facilitating handovers between the parents, and has ensured that [x] is not exposed to the parents\u2019 dispute. the parents gave opposing and contradictory accounts of the family violence during their relationship. [ms deacon] has alleged that [mr grover] displayed a pattern of controlling violence during their relationship, and alleged that he was physically and emotionally abusive towards [d]. she reported that this abuse was exacerbated by [mr grover]\u2019s excessive alcohol use. she believes there is a risk that [x] will be exposed to physical and emotional abuse in his care, as well as a risk of exposure to family violence between [mr grover] and his new partner. [mr grover] has denied that he was abusive towards [ms deacon], and alleged that she was the perpetrator of abuse. he denied that he consumes alcohol to excess, and there are no other indications that his alcohol use is currently problematic. if the court finds that [mr grover] has displayed a pattern of coercive violence in his relationship with [ms deacon], there are significant concerns about the ongoing risks to [x]. firstly, he has not acknowledged these behaviours nor sought intervention to change his behaviour, so it would be likely that he could display similar behaviours in his current relationship. additionally, it could be that [mr grover] is utilising the court system, criminal justice system, and health systems to continue his harassment of [ms deacon]. if the court finds that this is likely, the court may wish to consider granting sole parental responsibility to [ms deacon], to minimise [mr grover]\u2019s influence over [ms deacon]\u2019s decision-making. [ms deacon] has proposed that she be granted permission to relocate with [x] to brisbane. her primary reasons for relocation are that her parents plan to relocate to brisbane, and that she wishes to avoid ongoing contact with [mr grover]. [ms deacon] appears to have relied heavily on the support of her parents, and will have minimal natural supports if she remains living in [city b] once her parents move to queensland. [x] and [d] both have close relationships with their maternal grandmother, and it is likely to be distressing for them to be separated from her. more of a concern, however, is the impact on [ms deacon]\u2019s mental health. [ms deacon] and her mother have reported confidence in [ms deacon]\u2019s capacity to care for the children without [ms c\u2019s] assistance, but believe that her stress levels will dramatically increase due to the risks posed by contact with [mr grover]. [ms c] currently facilitates all handovers, and [ms deacon] appears fearful of the dynamic between the parents if they are required to manage direct handovers. if the court decides that [ms deacon] is best placed to provide primary care for [x], it will need to balance the risks to [ms deacon]\u2019s mental health and wellbeing if she is required to remain in [city b], and the risks to [x]\u2019s relationship with [mr grover] if [x] relocates to queensland. if the court does permit [ms deacon] to relocate with [x] to queensland, then [ms deacon]\u2019s proposal that this occurs at the end of 2023 has a number of positive aspects for [x]. it gives [x] another year to establish her relationship with [mr grover], making spending extended time with him more suitable, and it means she can commence her formal schooling in queensland in 2024, a natural point of transition in her development. [ms deacon] believes that [x]\u2019s relationship with [mr grover] may actually benefit from relocating to queensland, as she believes [mr grover] would then prioritise his time with [x], rather than working during the scheduled visits. while [x] may be able to maintain a relationship with [mr grover] spending time with him during school holidays, it limits his capacity to be involved in her schooling, and day-to-day parenting tasks, substantially changing his role in [x]\u2019s life. relocating to queensland would also affect [x]\u2019s relationship with [f], and her connections with her stepmother and stepsiblings. [mr grover] is concerned that, if [x] relocates to queensland, [ms deacon] will fail to provide any information to him about [x], and will not facilitate [x]\u2019s relationship with him. if the court does allow [x] to relocate to queensland, specific orders about the requirements for [ms deacon] to maintain this connection may be needed. [ms deacon] has indicated that, if the court does not allow [x] to relocate to queensland, she intends to remain living in [city b], and proposes that [x] continue to live with her, and spend weekend and school holiday time with [mr grover]. her primary concern with this arrangement is that it will exacerbate conflict with [mr grover], and they will not be able to manage handovers in a way that protects [x] from their dispute. [x] has lived primarily with her mother throughout her life, and appears happy and settled in her care. an arrangement in which [x] lives primarily with [ms deacon], and gradually increases her weekend and school holiday time with [mr grover] appears to provide stability for [x], as well opportunities for [x] to build a meaningful relationship with her father, and for him to be involved in the full gamut or parenting responsibilities. once [x] is at school, it will be possible for most handovers to occur at school, minimising the requirement for direct handovers. this may be possible from 2023, if [x] attends childcare on handover days. [mr grover] has proposed that [x] live with him, and spend regular weekend and school holiday time with [ms deacon]. his primary reason for proposing this change is that he believes that [ms deacon] does not facilitate his involvement in [x]\u2019s life, and he believes he would be better at ensuring [x] maintains her relationships with both parents. [x] appeared comfortable spending time with [mr grover], but currently spends only brief overnight periods with him. a change to living with him on a fulltime basis would be a dramatic change, which seems to be underestimated by [mr grover]. it seems that this arrangement would also significantly affect [x]\u2019s relationship with her sister, [d], who she has lived with throughout her life. [mr grover] also believes he is better placed to manage [x]\u2019s medical needs, due to his belief that [ms deacon] has fabricated symptoms and sought unnecessary assessments. if the court finds that this has occurred, the court may wish to have [mr grover] take responsibility for [x]\u2019s medical care. this may require a care arrangement where he has [x] in his care for at least part of the school week, to allow him to take [x] to appointments. fundamentally, the primary issue in the matter is the lack of trust between the parents. there has been a pattern of allegations and counter-allegations involving dcj, police, and this court, with both parents believing that the other parent is driven by spite, rather than [x]\u2019s best interests. [x] appears to have positive, affectionate relationships with both her parents, and a care arrangement that allows her to maintain regular contact with both her parents would be ideal. the history of the co-parenting relationship suggests that the parents would struggle to effectively facilitate a shared time spending arrangement. due to the lack of trust between the parents, and their inability to make decisions together, it may be that the court needs to consider granting only one parent responsibility for [x]\u2019s medical decisions. other long-term decisions, such as [x]\u2019s schooling, may be able to be negotiated in a mediated environment. recommendations in light of the above discussion, and unless evidentiary material should indicate otherwise: if the court determines that [x] is to remain in [city b], it is recommended that [x] live with her mother and spend alternate weekends with her father, from friday afternoon until monday morning, as well as the alternate thursday afternoon until friday morning. if the court determines that the mother may relocate with [x] to queensland in 2024, it is recommended that the above arrangement remain in place until the time of relocation, but increase to include four consecutive nights each alternate weekend for the final three months of 2023. once [x] relocates, it is recommended that [x] live with her mother, and spend time with her father for half of each school holiday period, and one additional weekend during each school term, in the [city b] area. it is recommended that the parents schedule regular video calls for [x] and her father, two or three days each week. oral evidence of ms g the mother has given evidence that she has not completed the parenting after separation, but if required to, she would be willing to complete that. would that be enough?\u2011\u2011\u2011no. i think those \u2013 those courses are quite good and it would be useful for both parents to complete them. both parents seemed fairly fixed in their perception of the other parent and while there might be some practical strategies that they can get out of those courses, i don\u2019t sense that there\u2019s likely to be a huge shift in their perceptions of one another which i think is really the basis of the difficulties in their co-parenting relationship. ... ... it would appear from the evidence that there is some, \u201cit will be fine. we will get it sorted,\u201d like a fairly easy, \u201cwe can do this,\u201d approach. i guess i\u2019m trying to explore in relation to their current relationships whether either parent, perhaps, has insight into how entrenched their positions are and what that means for the other parent?\u2011\u2011\u2011yes. i \u2013 i \u2013 i think i understand what you\u2019re getting at and \u2013 yes \u2013 there was, i think, a sense from mum that if she\u2019s just able to create some distance that that will provide enough resolution that she will then be able to communicate quite well. his honour: sorry to interrupt there. in your view, is that a bit too optimistic? is it realistic or what?\u2011\u2011\u2011i think it probably underestimates how difficult the relocation will be for the father to manage. and [x]?\u2011\u2011\u2011and possibly for [x] as well, but i think in terms of the father\u2019s experience of that, he \u2013 it\u2019s going to very difficult for him to move forward with a positive communication style with the mother if [x] does relocate which might be underestimated by the mother and, similarly, i think the father probably underestimates how stressful it will be for the mother to remain in [city b] once her parents move to queensland if she\u2019s feeling like she\u2019s stuck in [city b] without support because of him, that that then will make it potentially even more difficult for her to communicate with him. if there was to be any relocation, the more age-appropriate time to relocate the child is seven years of age, noting that x remains an immature child, (b) both x and her father would very likely struggle with any major change, such as her relocation to a place so far away, (c) it is highly likely that the mother seriously under-estimates the difficulties for herself, and for x, in any relocation, (d) the support from the mother\u2019s parents is significant but a somewhat similar level of support might be provided through one or both of telephone or facetime and that physical presence is not required, and (e) the maternal grandmother intends to make regular visits to the mother and child if the relocation is not granted. both x and her father would very likely struggle with any major change, such as her relocation to a place so far away, (c) it is highly likely that the mother seriously

maternal grandmother intends to make regular visits to the mother and child if the relocation is not granted. tendered documents index applicant\u2019s documents respondent\u2019s documents icl\u2019s documents written submissions on behalf of the applicant the proposals the applicant mother\u2019s primary case is that the child [x] born [in] 2019 (now 4 years old) continues to live with her and that she have sole parental responsibility for long term care decisions. she seeks to relocate [x]\u2019s residence to the brisbane/[region h] area of queensland by december 2023 (when she will be almost 5 years old and about to start school). in the alternative, the mother proposes parenting arrangements if [x] is required to continue to reside in the [city b/city j] area of nsw whereby she progresses to spending 5 nights per fortnight with the father, but it is her strong preference to move to queensland and she says that allowing the relocation is in [x]\u2019s best interests. whilst acknowledging that the case law is clear that she does not need to demonstrate a compelling reason to move1, the mother does have good and cogent reasons in support of the move. 2.1 her parents are moving to qld and they have been her main emotional and practical support, 2.2 both [x] and her older half- sister [d] have close relationships with the maternal grandmother and it is likely to be distressing for them to be separated from her, 2.3 the mother will be isolated in [city b] after her parents move and particularly vulnerable to the ongoing conflict with the father, 2.4 potential impact on the mother\u2019s mental health and well-being of the stress related to dealing with the father without the assistance of the maternal grandmother, 2.5 [x] is happy and well settled in the primary care of the mother, the mother wishes to continue as her primary carer and that arrangement is recommended by the court child expert as being in the best interests of [x]. 2.6 the mother says that she will be better able to parent [x] if she is living away from [city b] where she is anxious about the prospect of meeting the father at community events and exposing herself to the risk of prosecution for breach of the advo. 2.7 [x] has a good relationship with the father, his partner and her younger half-sister [f] which provides a strong foundation for an ongoing meaningful relationship even if she is living in the brisbane/[region h] area. the respondent father\u2019s primary case was that [x] should change to live with him and spend time with the mother in queensland but the case proceeded on the basis that the mother had conceded that she would not relocate without the child. the father\u2019s case at trial was that [x] should progress to an equal time week-about arrangement by 2024 when [x] starts school and that the parents should have equal shared parental responsibility for long term care decisions for [x]. the father\u2019s proposal of equal time once [x] is at school next year was not recommended by the court child expert and cannot be seen to be in her best interests given the high conflict and lack of trust between the parties. the applicant mother relies on her outline of case document filed 7 december 2022 and the documents listed in the outline, including the minute of orders sought. the legislative pathway the presumption of equal parental responsibility in s61da(1) does not apply in this case as the mother alleges family violence against the father and herself pleaded guilty to charges of family violence against the husband in criminal proceedings. the court may be satisfied that there are grounds for the exception in s61da(2)(b). in addition to the findings available to the court pursuant to s61da(2)(b), the presumption is also rebutted if the court is satisfied that it would not be in the child\u2019s best interest to have equal shared parental responsibility. at paragraph 88 court child expert stated that \u201cdue to the lack of trust between the parents, and their inability to make decisions together, it may be that the court needs to consider granting only one parent responsibility for [x]\u2019s medical decisions. other long-term decisions, such as [x]\u2019s schooling, may be able to be negotiated in a mediated environment\u201d. at the conclusion of the trial, it is clearly open to the court to find that it is overly optimistic to rely on negotiation in a mediated environment for other parental responsibility decisions to be made. the parent with primary care of [x]\u2019s should have sole parental responsibility for long term care decisions. the fundamental issue of \u201clack of trust\u201d identified by [ms g] appears unlikely to resolve. in the event that the court does order equal shared parental responsibility for [x], the court must then follow the legislative pathway and consider first equal time and then substantial and significant time. clearly, if the mother is permitted to relocate [x]\u2019s residence to queensland, neither equal time nor substantial and significant time with the father is reasonably practicable. if the mother is living in [city b] or [city j], substantial and significant time with the father is reasonably practicable as the distances involved support the mother\u2019s proposal of 5 nights per fortnight. the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration pursuant to s.65aa and while accepting that [x]\u2019s best interests may override the mother\u2019s right to freedom of movement and to choose where she lives with [x], she says that it cannot be in [x]\u2019s best interests for her mother to be restricted to living in the comparatively small rural city of [city b] where she has limited future employment prospects and heightened anxiety from the conflict with the father. the mother\u2019s needs are partly addressed by the alternative orders she seeks that she remain in the greater [city b/city j] area, but not completely, as she is still faced with the prospect of losing the regular and practical support of the maternal grandparents when they themselves relocate to brisbane/[region h]. relevant s60cc factors section 60cc(2)(a) - there is a clear benefit to [x] in having a meaningful relationship with each of her parents. it is clear on the evidence that [x] already has that quality of relationship with her mother and her father as she is secure in the care of each, despite the ongoing high conflict and the protracted litigation. section 60cc(2)(b) \u2013 there is a clear need to protect [x] from harm. the mother has experienced the father\u2019s behaviour as controlling and coercive and the mother\u2019s fear of this together with the ongoing behaviour of the father, puts [x] at risk. an example of this is the father reporting the mother to the police almost 2 years after separation immediately after there was a concern than his new partner had stalked the mother. there is a further example post-trial with the new evidence from the advo proceedings. the father gave evidence in this court that he did not fear the mother and that he would file an application to revoke the advo and a consent order was made to that effect. whilst he did file his application, his instructions to the prosecutor [in early] 2023 as recorded on transcript in open court at the local court were that he did fear the mother and did want the continued protection of the advo. at the [early] 2023 listing the police prosecutor indicated to the presiding judge that \u201c...i was instructed by [mr grover] that his application to revoke and now application to vary was only put forward by instruction under family law proceedings, and that he still wants the avo. (page 2, paras 23 \u2013 26). the father\u2019s actions in changing his evidence between the 2 courts leave the mother in the situation where she continues to feel at risk of criminal prosecution in any potential interaction with the father, about which she is not surprisingly anxious. the advo continues until [mid] 2024. section 60cc(3)(a) \u2013 [x] at 4 years old is too young for her views to have any weight. section 60cc(3)(b) \u2013 [x] has a good relationship with each of her parents, her half-siblings and extended family on both the maternal and paternal sides. these relationships will continue to develop and be meaningful, whether she is living in the brisbane/[region h] area or in the [city b/city j] area, however [x] will particularly miss the day to day contact with the maternal grandmother if she is not living in the brisbane/[region h] area. section 60cc(3)(c) \u2013 the poor co-parenting relationship has impacted on the capacity of the parties to both be involved in long term parenting decisions to date and there is no real prospect of that relationship improving given the continuation of the advo. section 60cc(3)(d) \u2013 the mother\u2019s relocation proposal will have an impact on [x]\u2019s ability to spend time with the father and the paternal family during school terms but the mother\u2019s proposal builds in a delay until [x] is about to turn 5 years old to continue to build the relationship to assist the transition to video and holiday time with the father. section 60cc(3)(e) \u2013 there is an additional expense involved in travel if [x] is living in queensland. section 60cc(3)(f) \u2013 the mother has the greater capacity to meet the needs of [x] as her established primary carer but each parent is able to meet her day to day needs. section 60cc(3)(g) \u2013 the mother is best placed to arrange for [x]\u2019s medical issues to be managed appropriately. section 60cc(3)(i) \u2013 the father has been unable to manage his distrust of the mother and the care she has provided for [x], particularly around medical decisions, and this has affected the capacity of the parents to co-parent [x]. whilst each parent meets [x]\u2019s immediate needs, they are effectively only capable of parallel parenting and from the perspective of the mother, she will be better able to do that if not living in [city b]. section 60cc(3)(j) \u2013 there is acknowledged family violence on behalf of the mother and she deposed to progressing with her counselling to understand the reactive nature of her violence. the father has not acknowledged any responsibility for family violence. section 60cc(3)(k) \u2013 there is a family violence order against the mother until [mid] 2024 which the father reneged on revoking. section 60cc(3)(l) \u2013 it is preferable to make an order which is least likely to lead to further proceedings. from the mother\u2019s perspective, this is the order which allows her to relocate with [x] and remove herself from living close to the father. the evidence the applicant the applicant was extensively cross-examined by counsel for the respondent and counsel for the icl. it is submitted that she was honest in her evidence, and made appropriate concessions, in particular in relation to the family violence convictions. it was clear from her evidence that she too experienced events during the relationship as family violence and was anxious to avoid situations which may expose [x] to the high conflict between the parties and their families. the applicant showed insight gained from her counselling about the dynamic between the parties but she remains anxious. the applicant\u2019s mother [ms c] the applicant\u2019s mother presented as an attentive and caring grandmother, prepared to provide practical assistance for the benefit of her grandchild, including regular changeovers. however, she too is impacted by the conflict between the parties and the lack of trust each has in the other, leading to issues at changeover. [ms c] was firm in her intention of relocating with her husband to queensland as soon as the home in [city b] could be sold and a suitable home purchased in qld. [ms g] (court child expert) the court child expert was particularly concerned about [x]\u2019s medical needs. paragraph 78 \u201cit is highly likely that the parent\u2019s dispute about [x]\u2019s medical needs will disrupt the medical care that she is able to receive, and could have a negative psychological impact on [x].\u201d despite the availability of the letters about [x]\u2019s genetic testing and the \u201cclinical diagnosis\u201d, the parties clearly read the medical information in different ways which cannot be in [x]\u2019s best interests. the court child expert was supportive of the mother\u2019s attention to [x]\u2019s medical needs and there is no expert opinion to support the father\u2019s view that the mother exaggerates [x]\u2019s symptoms due to some mental health issue. dr m (single expert psychiatrist) [dr m] was not required for cross-examination. he assessed the mother as suffering from anxiety but not such that she was not a capable parent for [x] the father the father\u2019s credibility as a witness is challenged in particular in 2 instances. firstly, the father failed to disclose that he had been banned from child care, with the consequence that his partner [ms e] then had to collect on his behalf. it is significant that the father had no insight into the effect of his behaviour on the staff at the child care, just as he appeared to have no insight into the effect of his behaviour on the mother. secondly, the father gave evidence and agreed to a consent order in this court to make an application to revoke the advo. he then advised the prosecutor that he did not want the order revoked and the prosecutor then failed to support his application. if accepted as being an accurate account of the father\u2019s instructions, then his position (still wanting the advo) is inconsistent with the evidence he gave under oath in the family law proceedings. this goes to credit. he says one thing in this court and something different in the local court. the issue is particularly significant given the context of the focus in the father\u2019s evidence on the parties cooperating in the future and the fact that the mother should do face to face handovers with the father and have contact with him. the mother had expressed concerns that she could be accused of breaching the advo and that was a real cause of anxiety for her. to counter that claim, the father was at pains to suggest that the advo was not necessary and he did feel safe interacting with the mother. the court cannot have confidence that the parties will be able to interact safely in the [city b] area and that puts [x]\u2019s best interests at risk. the father\u2019s partner, [ms e] the court can have no doubt after the evidence of [ms e] that she cares deeply for [x] and that she is very supportive of the father. however, it is clear that she is very negative about the mother, does not trust her or the maternal grandmother and that attitude contributes to the risk to [x] of being exposed to conflict if the parties continue to live in close proximity. [ms e]\u2019s postings on social media and involvement in groups supporting male victims of domestic violence predispose her to thinking the worst of the mother. this distrust lead to a joint decision between the father and [ms e] not to inform the mother when [x] suffered a burn in their care from the unguarded [...] heater, contributing to the mother\u2019s anxiety that [x] may not be safe in the care of the father. conclusion the mother submits that it is in the best interest of the child, for her to continue to live in the primary care of the mother. her preference is to relocate to queensland late in 2023. written submissions on behalf of the respondent this matter was set down for final hearing from 14-16 december 2022. the gravamen of the proceeding was to determine whether the parties\u2019 child [x] born [in] 2019 (now 4 years old) should be permitted to relocate to the brisbane/[region h] area with her mother. importantly if the mother was not permitted to relocate [x] to the brisbane/[region h] area, the mother would remain in [city b]. the father seeks orders that would see [x] living in an alternate week arrangement by the time she commences primary school in january 2024. the mother sought to rebut the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility due to the presence of family violence whilst the father seeks an order for equal shared parental responsibility. evidence was provided by the father, the mother, the father\u2019s partner [ms e], the father\u2019s brother, [ms e]\u2019s brother, the maternal grandmother and the expert [ms g]. all but the father\u2019s brother and [ms e]\u2019s brother were cross examined. given there was insufficient time to hear oral submissions, an order was made for written submissions. set out below are the written submissions in support of the father\u2019s orders that [x] remain living in [city b]. (b) credit in this matter it is respectfully submitted it is not necessary nor helpful to make findings of credit given the evidence currently before the court and the orders sought the parties \u2013 in particular the mother proposes 5 nights a fortnight with the father in the event [x] remains in [city b]. it is noted however that there cannot be criticism for the events precipitated by his application to have the mother\u2019s advo revoked \u2013 as the mother invites the court to do in her written submissions. consistent with his evidence on the last day of the trial in december 2022, he approached the local court to have it revoked however events transpired which saw the applicant for the advo (the nsw police) seek to vary the order rather than revoke it. evidence at the interim hearing of the mother\u2019s application on 7 march 2023, including the father\u2019s affidavit make this position clear. strangely when one reads the transcript the mother\u2019s own legal representation, [ms s] sought that the advo remain in place in its original form, despite the prosecutor seeking to vary it. (c) part vii of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cpart vii\u201d) part vii sets out the children\u2019s provisions. the objects of the part and principles underlying it are in section 60b. save and except for the objects relating to protecting children from harm (given neither party suggest [x] would be at risk of harm with the other), each of the other objects set out in section 60b are relevant. section 60ca provides that in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, the court must have regard to the best interests of the child as a paramount consideration. in determining what is in a child\u2019s best interest the court must consider the matters set out in section 60cc(2) and (3). indeed the provisions of part vii and the pathway through the legislation apply to relocation matters just as they do in any other children\u2019s case. the best interests of the child is the paramount consideration. (d) summary of matters under ss.60cc primary considerations \u2013 the children benefit from a meaningful relationship with both of the children\u2019s parents and the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm [ms g] does not make a recommendation about where [x] should live. in terms of [x]\u2019s relationship with each parent the evidence supports the contention that both parents have a meaningful relationship with [x]. the ultimate orders proposed by the father would see [x] spending increasingly age appropriate time progressing to week about from the commencement of primary school. the mother\u2019s orders for relocation would see a dramatic reduction in the father\u2019s time and it is submitted neither the father nor the expert are of the view that such orders would enable [x] to maintain a meaningful relationship with the father. in the event she does not relocate she proffers an increasing time regime until [x] is seeing her father 5 nights a fortnight. it is submitted, given that concession there is no arguable reason why week about would not be appropriate. any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child\u2019s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child\u2019s views. given [x] was 3 years [old] at the time of interview, little can be garnered from what she may have told the family consultant. her views are irrelevant. the nature of the relationship of the child with each of the child\u2019s parents and other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) [x] has a close relationships with each parent and the father\u2019s fianc\u00e9 [ms e] in addition to friends and family in [city b/city j] area. it is submitted that if she was to relocate to queensland that she will lose these important connections. the mother despite having a close relationship with [x], is an anxious parent and is hyper-vigilant when it comes to medical issues. the benefit of the father\u2019s orders for ultimately equal time is [x] being exposed to two different parenting styles. the mother concedes in her written submissions that \u201cthere is no doubt [ms e] cares deeply for [x] and she is supportive of the father\u201d. the sibling relationship between [x] and her sister [f] is equally important. they share a close bond and a separation would undoubtedly have a significantly detrimental impact on that relationship, especially given their ages. of similar importance is the relationship between [ms e]\u2019s children and the child. this too would be damaged by any relocation. the mother has always lived in [the city b/city j] area, as a consequence she would be removing herself from that social network in addition to removing her daughter [d] from her friendship group and school. the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the child, to spend time with the child and to communicate with the child both parties are committed parents. the father seeks to be actively involved in major decisions that involves [x]. however, it is submitted that the mother goes to great lengths to distance the father from such decision making, in particular relating to her health needs, contrary to court orders. the mother asserts that the child has been diagnosed with [a medical condition]. the mother chose not to involve the father in appointments with specialists. it is submitted that there has been no formal diagnosis by any medical professional. such was his desire to be involved in decisions pertaining to her health, the father took it upon himself to undertake genetic testing to ascertain if [x] had any gene mutation which could identify if she had [that medical condition], results confirmed she does not. the father has taken every opportunity given to him to see [x]. at the commencement of the proceedings he agreed to interim orders for supervised contact to see [x] such was his desire to maintain that relationship. the father regularly seeks additional time with [x] in addition to those provided for in the orders. the extent to which each parent has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, the parent\u2019s obligation to maintain the child it is submitted that the parties have fulfilled their obligations to maintain [x]. the father meets his child support obligations as assessed by the agency. the likely effect of any changes in the child\u2019s circumstances, including the likely effect on the child of any separation from either of his or her parents or any other child, or other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), with whom he or she has been living the family consultant\u2019s view in cross examination was that if relocation were to happen she would be more comfortable for it to happen if [x] were at least 7 years of age. she is only 4 years old. she was concerned that [x] was too young to maintain the relationship in the large periods she was away from her father. clearly managing the periods apart would be difficult for parents who co-parent well, significantly more problematic for parents who cannot co-parent effectively. she also advanced that there was no research to indicate that an attachment could be maintained by \u201cfacetime\u201d where the subjects had long periods apart. and that is unsurprising given we are dealing with a child of 4 who on the mother\u2019s case if permitted to relocate would see her father on one occasion during a school term. respectfully this consideration alone when balanced against the mother\u2019s reasons for relocating, should see her application fail. the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with and communicating with a parent it is submitted that there is an obvious and significant practical difficulty to the mother\u2019s proposal. the parties and [x] currently live in [city b]. [x] is clearly too young to travel as an unaccompanied minor. the mother proffers no evidence of the distances to be travelled, how that distance is to be travelled or the costs of doing so. the court can take judicial notice that [city b] is a country town in nsw. the mother seeks to relocate to queensland. the father\u2019s evidence was that the drive to brisbane was over 12 hours and the flight time (not including the drive to [city j] airport, waiting time and the drive to the mother\u2019s home from the airport) was one hour and 45 minutes one way. either option would be an exhausting enterprise for a young child. the father\u2019s untested evidence was he cannot relocate. and of course the mother lives in her own home in [city b]. there is no suggestion of financial difficulty in remaining in [city b]. the court has no evidence to determine whether a move would result in an imposition of difficult financial circumstances for the mother. the mother has chosen not to advance any evidence of what her property is worth or what a property in brisbane may cost. the capacity of each of the child\u2019s parents and any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs the parties are capable of meeting [x]\u2019s needs and have done so since she was born. the single expert, [dr m] said in respect of the mother \u201cthe writer found no evidence to suggest that [ms deacon]\u2019s trauma disorder impacted on her capacity to parent [x]\u201d and again at paragraph 665 single expert said \u201cthere was no evidence to suggest that the trauma-related disorder impacted upon [ms deacon]\u2019s capacity to care for [x] independently at any time\u201d. finally at paragraph 620 the single expert said \u201cthe prognosis for a sustained recovery from [ms deacon]\u2019s trauma related disorder is very good, provided she is able to continue accessing appropriate psychological intervention and counselling\u201d. the court ought have no concerns about the mother\u2019s ability to parent [x] in the event her parents move and she remains in [city b] with [x]. indeed the paternal grandmother said to the expert that she had confidence she would manage. the one area of concern when it comes to the mother\u2019s ability to parent [x] is her inability to encourage [x]\u2019s relationship with the father. the mother clearly holds the father in little regard. she has previously assaulted him, although the tenor of her evidence of the assault was that it was the father\u2019s fault and she was the victim. we know that for almost 5 months post separation the mother supervised the father\u2019s time with [x]. other than the incident [in late] 2020 in which the mother unilaterally withheld [x] from the father she made no complaint about the father\u2019s care of [x] during this time. yet she now alleges her anxiety at seeing the father is so great she cannot attend handovers. she has alleged the dcj informed her that she should leave the father or [x] would be removed from her care. there is nothing in the dcj records indicating this. we also know that following a court ordered supervised visit with the father on 4 november 2020, the mother withheld [x] and refused to facilitate further supervised contact citing that she was concerned about a scratch on [x]\u2019s [body]. this led to the mother taking [x] to the hospital and [x] being stripped down and forensically examined. the mother alleged that she was subsequently advised by the hospital staff and dcj not to facilitate contact with the father. there is nothing in the dcj or the hospital notes indicating this. the mother and the maternal grandmother acknowledged in cross examination that they were surprised by the measures taken by the hospital, but they still chose not to intervene. concerningly the mother and the maternal grandmother confirmed in cross examination that they would not have changed anything that happened although it being clear from the hospital notes that [x] was distressed during the physical examination. of equal concern given her desire to relocate is the fact the mother does not provide makeup time when [x] misses time with the father pursuant to court orders. for instance, the father filed a contravention application on 2 december 2020 and no make-up time was provided for the time he missed. and of course the court is aware that [x]\u2019s half sister [d] has no relationship with her father and it is submitted the mother moved home in detriment to that relationship. the father says that the mother said to him many times during the relationship \u201ci do not want to share [d]. i hope he [mr r] just gives up and goes away\u201d. all these factors point to a mother who is not desirous of supporting [x]\u2019s relationship with her father. that is particularly concerning when the mother wants to relocate [x] so far away from the father resulting in [x] spending just one weekend with him during the school term. there are also concerns about the mother\u2019s relationship with the maternal grandmother, which the father describes as tumultuous given the maternal grandmother\u2019s desire to control and manipulate the mother. the maternal grandmother confirmed in cross examination that the mother calls her controlling. it is not surprising in these circumstances that there have been incidents at handover involving the maternal grandmother the father and the police. the maturity, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the child and either of the children\u2019s parents, and any other characteristics of the child that the court thinks are relevant the father and [ms e] are both [from country t]. the father submits that [x] benefits from extended family events in which [country t] cultural activities are organised and [x] participates. the parents agree that the child has asthma and that it is managed by them. the attitude to the child and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the children\u2019s parents the parties do their best for [x] in the time that they have with her however the mother\u2019s inability to foster [x]\u2019s relationship with the father is of considerable concern given the orders she seeks. any family violence involving the child or a member of the child\u2019s family the mother was charged with an incident of family violence and pled guilty. a final advo was made in which the father was listed as a protected person. the advo does not prohibit the mother from attending changeovers or contacting the father in relation to matters that concerns [x]. the advo will remain in place until [mid] 2024. whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to the child the mother has a history of not complying with court orders. if the mother is permitted to relocate [x] it will undoubtedly lead to further contraventions, a deleterious effect on the relationship between [x] and her father and consequently proceedings by the father to enforce orders in order to maintain that relationship. this is not an outcome that is in the best interests of [x]. other relevant matters n/a section 65daa the father\u2019s urges the court to make an order for equal shared parental responsibility and furthermore on the father\u2019s case it is both in [x]\u2019s best interests and reasonably practicable for her to spend equal time with the parties. (e) conclusion it is submitted that when looking at section 60cc and what is in [x]\u2019s best interests, your honour would find that [x] should not be permitted to relocate and that the orders proposed by the father in those circumstances are in [x]\u2019s best interests. independent children\u2019s lawyers written submissions proposals this matter is in relation to the live with and spend time with arrangements for the child [x] born [in] 2019, aged 4 years. [x] is the child of [ms deacon] and [mr grover]. [ms deacon] seeks orders that she have sole parental responsibility for [x] and [x] be permitted to relocate with her to the brisbane/[region h area]. [ms deacon] conceded at hearing that if [x] is not permitted to relocate, she will remain in the [city b/city j] region. in the alternative, [ms deacon] proposes if [x] is not able to relocate that [x] live with her parents in a 9/5 arrangement in her favour. [mr grover] seeks an orders for equal shared parental responsibility and that by january 2024 [x] live in a week about arrangement. the independent childrens lawyer (\u201cicl\u201d) relies on her amended case outline filed 14 december 2022 and her minute of order sought filed 6 december 2022. parental responsibility section 61da(1) of the family law act 1975 (\u201cthe act\u201d) states that the court must apply a presumption that it is in a child\u2019s best interests for their parents to have equal shared parental responsibility. however section 61da(2) of the act states the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds for believing that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the icl submits that the court will find that family violence has occurred in this case and the evidence of this is that the mother was charged with and plead guilty of assault [offences]. the victim of the charges was [mr grover]. further, [in mid] 2022 an apprehended domestic violence order was made in which [mr grover] is named the protected person and the mother is the respondent. [ms deacon] alleges that she was also the victim of family violence and was cross-examined on these allegations. the father denied all family violence allegations against him. [ms g] at paragraph 83 raises concerns that if the court finds that [mr grover] has displayed a pattern of coercive violence, she would have concerns that he has not acknowledged or sought treatment of this behaviour. the icl submits that the court can and should find that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility does not apply pursuant to section 61da(2)(b). the icl submits that the court may also find that the presumption is rebutted pursuant to section 61da(4), being that it is not in [x]\u2019s best interests for her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility. it is acknowledged by the icl that an order granting sole parental responsibility to one parent should not be arrived at lightly, however, in this matter there is evidence of: - a lack of trust between the parents. the parents being at odds in relation to medical decisions for [x]. the mother experiencing anxiety in negotiating with the father or even attending the same location as the father. contradictory evidence before the court by the father of whether or not he remains in fear of the mother. the father gave evidence in this court that he did not have concerns for his safety in relation to the mother, but the transcripts from the local court appear to indicate that [mr grover] continued to hold fears and did not want the apprehended domestic violence order revoked. while these transcripts were untested in court, they speak for themselves in relation to what happened in the local court. the family report writer [ms g] was clear in both her report and in her evidence that it was unlikely the parents would be able to co-parent into the future. paragraph 88 of the family report by [ms g] states: \u201cfundamentally, the primary issue in the matter is the lack of trust between the parents. there has been a pattern of allegations and counter-allegations involving dcj, police and this court, with both parents believing that the other parent is driven by spite rather than [x]\u2019s best interests.\u201d the icl supports these comments and in submits that an order for equal shared parental responsibility is likely to increase the conflict between the parents and may affect [x] receiving timely medical treatment. in marvel & marvel (no2) [2010] fam cafc 10 at paragraph 103 the court said: - \u201cit appears to us that as a parenting order, including an order for equal shared parental responsibility, must be in the best interests of a child, a court may in the exercise of its discretion find it is inappropriate to make such an order in certain circumstances. this could occur where, although there is no family violence or child abuse, the conflict or lack of effective communication between the parents is such that to properly exercise their equal shared parental responsibility they would be unable to comply with s 65dac by consulting and making a genuine effort to reach agreement about major long-term issues affecting their child or children. in other words, in these circumstances an order for equal shared parental responsibility would inevitably lead to further conflict and perhaps contravention applications, which conflict and/or ongoing litigation could be adverse to the child\u2019s best interests.\u201d the icl submits that the court can and should find that the parties would not be able to communicate at a level that is required to properly exercise equal shared parental responsibility and would fall within the above example in marvel & marvel (no 2). if the court finds that an order for equal shared parental responsibility is appropriate the court must then follow the legislative pathway in section 65daa of the act. whether equal time or substantial and significant time is reasonably practicable will depend on the court\u2019s determination as to whether [x] is able to relocate to the brisbane/[region h] area. i will make detailed submissions about the relocation and spend time with arrangements below, however, at this time it is submitted that if the relocation is permitted then equal time or substantial and significant time is not reasonably practicable. conversely, if the relocation is not permitted then equal time or substantial and significant time is reasonably practicable. relocation the mother seeks an order from this court that [x] be able to relocate from [city b] to the brisbane/[region h] area and has conceded that if [x] is unable to relocate she would remain in the [city j/city b] region. the mother seeks this order primarily on the basis that her parents, which have provided significant and substantial support to the mother, intend to relocate. the maternal grandmother gave evidence that she intends to relocate to queensland and that this would occur even in circumstances where the court did not allow [x] to relocate. the mother\u2019s second reason for seeking relocation is on the basis that she will have better employment prospects in the brisbane/[region h] area than in [city b]. the icl submits that the mother\u2019s evidence on this point was not persuasive and at its highest is only supported by a letter from her current employer that they will consider a transfer of employment to that area should there be \u201csuitable opportunities in the region at the time of her relocation.\u201d see annexure u to the mother\u2019s affidavit sworn 23 november 2023. it is well settled law that the parent wishing to relocate does not need to demonstrate \u201ccompelling reasons to justify the relocation\u201d ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 at 191. it is also well settled law that parenting proceedings involving relocation are to be determined in the same manner in which all parenting proceedings are determined. in zahawi and rayne [2016]famcafc 90 at paragraphs 47 and 48 the court said 47. all applications for parenting orders before the court involve a situation that, axiomatically, is not in the children\u2019s best interests. what is best for children is that their parents co-parent by agreement and without conflict and as selflessly as circumstances reasonably allow. when parents are unable to agree, the parents\u2019 proposals embraced in competing applications involve, again axiomatically, advantages and disadvantages for the children, each and all of which have ramifications for the children\u2019s best interests. concomitantly, gummow and callinan jj said in u v u: ...the reality is that maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents: obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement have been incurred.[16] 48. \u201crelocation cases\u201d are no different from other applications for parenting orders in that respect. like all applications for parenting orders, an application to have the children live with a parent significantly geographically remote from the other parent is to be determined by the children\u2019s best interests. however, the issues in a \u201crelocation case\u201d are, by reason of the proposed geographical separation of parents from their children, often significantly more acute and all the more so in cases of proposed international relocation.[17] and, of course, that same factor will usually render more acute the burden or burdens to be borne by one parent or the other, including restrictions on their freedoms. in adamson & adamson (2014) flc 93-62 at 79,700 at [65] \u2013 [66] the full court said: it follows from the decisions of the high court in ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 and u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 that in parenting proceedings there is no requirement for a parent to demonstrate \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d to live where the parent proposes to live, be that a proposed new location or, axiomatically, in their current place of residence. here, the mother was no more required to demonstrate \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for her choice to remain living in town s than was the father to so do with respect to his choice to live in town c or for either to not live anywhere else. the same may be said of their respective choices of employment, the mother\u2019s in town s and the father\u2019s in sydney. the court must be sensitive to the wishes and rights of parents to live and work wherever they desire. (u v u at [82] citing ams v aif). the written submissions of the mother filed 24 march 2023 at paragraph 2 outline her reasons for wishing to relocate to the same area in which her parents intend to move. it is not in dispute that upon the grandparents moving, the mother would have no familial support which she has previously and currently significantly relied on. the mother gave evidence that her mental health would be affected if she was required to remain in the [city b] area and take on the responsibilities of facilitating time with the father. while there was no medical evidence tendered by the mother to this effect, her evidence as to the anxiety she experiences even in incidental contact with the father is significant. the father\u2019s position at trial was that [x] should not be able to relocate and if the mother wished to relocate [x] should come into his primary care. while the decision of relocation is finely balanced, the case law is clear in that the mother does not need a compelling reason to relocate and the court needs to be considerate of the mother\u2019s freedom of movement to live and work wherever she chooses. relevant 60cc factors there is clearly a benefit to [x] having a meaningful relationship with both parents. as stated in mccall and clark [2009] famcafc 92, (2009) flc 93-405 \u201ca meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitive adjective, not a strictly quantitative one.\u201d [mr grover] seeks orders that [x] remain in [city b] and that she commence a week about arrangement when she commences school. it is submitted that the evidence presented in this matter does not support a week about arrangement. [ms g] in her report recommends that if [x] remains in [city b] there be a 10/4 arrangement in favour of the mother, this did not change when she gave evidence. [ms g] at paragraph 90 proposed a regime of time increasing for [x] in the event she was able to relocate with her mother in 2024. [ms g] in her evidence stated that a further year or so remaining in [city b] will secure [x]\u2019s relationship with her father prior to relocation. the icl submits that the orders proposed in her minute of consent that cover both if the relocation is permitted or not, provide for [x] to have a meaningful relationship with her parents. it is submitted by the icl that the court will be able to find that the most significant risk for [x] is the ongoing relationship dynamics between the adults in her life. there is evidence before the court of both the mother and father making complaints against each other including to the police, childcare and child welfare authorities, videoing changeovers and parties even following each other. there is evidence before the court of the parent\u2019s disagreements in relation to medical matters, which may have the consequence that [x] is not provided adequate treatment when she requires it. given [x]\u2019s age no weight can be given to her views or wishes. at paragraph 88 [ms g] described [x] having a positive, affectionate relationship with both her parents. [x] has a close relationship with her half-sister [d] who she has resided with all her life and a close relationship with her maternal grandmother [ms c] who she has seen every day since birth. the evidence before the court is clear that [ms c] has provided significant support to [ms deacon] and [x]. [x] and her mother reside with the maternal grandparents who are acutely involved in [x]\u2019s care. [x] also has a close and developing relationship with [mr grover]\u2019s partner [ms e] and her half-sister [f]. the icl submits that the court will find that both parents have to the extent possible taken the opportunity to participate in long-term decision making, spending time with and communicating with [x] and have fulfilled their parental obligations. what is clear in the evidence is that the co-parenting relationship since separation has been fraught with difficulties and that there have been difficulties since separation in relation to the parent\u2019s ability to make joint decisions in relation to medical matters, difficulties in relation to the time [x] spends with her father and a complete lack of trust between the parents. a significant consideration in this matter is 60cc(3)(d) and the potential impact on [x] of the different proposals before the court. there is no dispute that if the mother is able to relocate there will be an impact on the relationship [x] has with her father, [f] and his extended family. it is undisputed that [ms deacon] has been [x]\u2019s primary carer. the evidence of [ms c] is that she and her husband will be relocating to queensland and at paragraph 84 of [ms g]\u2019s report she opines that [x] and [d] are likely to be distressed in being separated from their grandmother. further she states that if the court finds that [ms deacon] should be the primary carer for [x], the court will need to balance the risks to [ms deacon]\u2019s mental health and well-being against and the risks to the relationship between [x], her father and the paternal family. if the court was to determine that [x] should be in the primary care of her father, [ms g]\u2019s report at paragraph 87 states this would be a \u201ca dramatic change, which seems to be underestimated by [mr grover].\u201d [ms g] in her evidence was clear that it would be preferable for [x] to remain in [city b] for a further 1 \u2013 2 years for the purpose of establishing a strong relationship between [x] and her father, prior to the relocation. [ms g] in her evidence was clear that if the mother was to relocate after a 1 -2 year period, [x] would be able to maintain a meaningful relationship with her paternal family despite the distance. [ms g] gave evidence that if permitted to relocate, she believed the mother would continue to facilitate [x]\u2019s relationship with her father. there is no evidence before the court that either parent is not able to provide for [x]\u2019s needs. the father contends that the mother would not be able to facilitate a positive relationship between him and the child. the icl submits that the evidence will not allow the court to make such a finding. as already stated, the level of distrust between the parents is significant. neither parent trusts each other in relation to medical issues which has led [x] to be taken for second opinions and subjected to significant and distressing medical checks. the icl submits that parallel parenting of [x] is likely to occur, which would not be in [x]\u2019s best interests (especially in relation to medical issues). the icl submits that the father in his evidence minimises the potential impact on [x] in being separated from her sister [d] with many of his responses instead focusing on [f]. while this is important, the reality is that [x] has lived all her life with [d] and the impact on her of being separated on [d] is likely to be far more significant that the impact of separation with [f]. the court heard evidence in relation to the father having been banned from collecting [x] from childcare. the father downplayed the incident and seemed to place most of the blame on the staff. the one area of concern for the icl was the mother\u2019s evidence in relation to [x] being subjected to an invasive examination at the hospital and that if the same was to occur again the mother would do the same thing. the icl has addressed the issue of family violence at paragraphs 7 \u2013 9 of these submissions. the icl submits that it will be open to the court to find that both parents at various times have engaged in family violence. all parties agree that it would be in [x]\u2019s best interests for an order to be made that is least likely to lead to instigation of further proceedings. the icl submits that an order for sole parental responsibility and very specific orders for spend time, changeover, communication etc. are required in this matter. evidence of witnesses the icl submits that the court will find the mother to be an honest and reliable witness. the icl submits that the anxiety described by the mother in having to have direct contact with the father, while it may seem excessive is her reality and was not embellished. the mother\u2019s insight into the co-parenting relationship now and into the future with the father should be preferred. the father\u2019s evidence was that the mother should have attended handovers in the past and should do so in the future, despite hearing the mother\u2019s reservations, anxieties and worries that she may be in breach of the advo. the father gave evidence that he was not in fear of the mother and did not require the continuation of the advo, and yet his position appears at least on the transcripts from the local court to contradict this. the father in his written submissions seems to lay the blame at the feet of the mother for not agreeing to a variation, yet he does not dispute the contents of the transcript which clearly shows he wanted the advo to continue. the icl submits that the father in his affidavits, oral evidence and in his written submissions shows a lack of willingness to accept any failings on his part to the current status of the co-parenting relationship. the mother answered truthfully about her feelings towards the father and her unwillingness to deal with, come into contact with or co-parent with the father. there is no doubt that all family members who gave evidence in these proceedings love and adore [x] and want what is best for her. the icl submits that the father\u2019s evidence and that of [ms e] combined would raise serious concerns about their willingness to facilitate a relationship with [x] and her maternal family if there was a change of residence. [ms e] was clear in her oral evidence that she would never allow [f] to spend time with [x] in the home of the maternal family and of concern to the court should be the social media postings and her distrust of the mother and maternal grandmother. conclusion the icl submits an order for sole parental responsibility in favour of the mother should be made in this matter and an order that [x] live with her mother is appropriate. the icl submits that the court should make an order permitting [x] to relocate to the brisbane/[region h] area, but that this not be before december 2024 and the spend time with arrangements for the time with her father be in accordance with the icl\u2019s proposed orders 8, 9, 10 & 11. if the court determines a relocation is not in [x]\u2019s best interests, the icl submits that the spend time with arrangements [x] spend with her father be in accordance with the icl\u2019s proposed orders 4, 5, 6 & 7. outline of principle ... maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents, obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement having been incurred. ... it must not be assumed that one parent (the father) cannot move and that the mother must, in every case, subordinate her ambitions and wishes, not to the needs of the child, but to the wishes of the father to pursue his life in a place of his choosing. it is the interests of the child which are paramount, not the interests or needs of the parents, let alone the interests of one of them. 4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. \"[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms.\" because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be \"best\" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing. in most cases about parenting orders under the family law act there is no conceptual difficulty in the court applying the principle that the best interests of the child are the paramount consideration. however, that is not so when deciding upon orders in what have become known as \u201crelocation cases\u201d. that is because, when in relocation cases regard is also had to another consideration, namely the right to freedom of movement of a parent, a delicate interplay of concepts arises. that is on the most favourable view of it. on another view, that to which i incline, the result is an imbroglio of principles. on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to \u201cgive the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.\u201d on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the \u201cnatural limitations\u201d that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the \u201cfeeling\u201d of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole. ... [a] primary judge [is] obliged to give sufficient reasons to explain the overall result: not to explain every forensic step in reaching that result. ... it has to be remembered that no two cases which involve the possibility of children being moved from their established residence and from one of their parents will ever present in an exactly identical way to the judge or federal magistrate who has to determine such cases. in every such case, issues peculiar to that case will arise. moreover, no two judicial officers will necessarily see the issues arising in any particular case as capable of treatment (for example within the framework of the provisions of s 65daa) in exactly the same way. the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child\u2019s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child\u2019s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child\u2019s best interests (s.65daa(2)) ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s 60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues: the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility. ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words \u201cmeaningful involvement\u201d. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting: the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements. ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]\u2013[199]): 6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) \u2014 (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than \u201c1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays\u201d or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve \u201cboth\u201d parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children. ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines \u201cmeaningful\u201d as \u201cfull of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system\u201d. \u201cmeaning\u201d is defined as \u201chaving intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)\u201d. a second definition is \u201cconveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive\u201d. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines \u201cmeaning\u201d (in generalised use) as \u201csignificance\u201d. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as \u201cfull of meaning, significant\u201d. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as \u201cexpressive or significant: a meaning look\u201d. [26] what these definitions convey is that \u201cmeaningful\u201d, when used in the context of \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d, is synonymous with \u201csignificant\u201d which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cof consequence\u201d. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant. even if the move results in a diminution of quality of the relationship, what the legislation aspires to promote is a meaningful relationship, not an optimal relationship. i am conscious that a long-distance relationship, with longer but less frequent times spent together, is inevitably different from a relationship where people live closer together with regular face-to-face contact. but it does not itself mean it cannot be meaningful. we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o\u2019ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]: the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court\u2019s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child\u2019s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider \u201cthe benefit to the child\u201d of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j\u2019s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original) the full court also observed at [191]: \u201cthe first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 \u201d. a) in the absence of legislative direction, no single factor is dispositive of decisions governing residence of a child in a context of the proposed relocation of the parent with whom the child resides. (ams v aif, kirby j, [143], cf. powell v ptolemy, [48]). b) the over-arching issue is to ensure that any parenting order is in the best interests of the child. (ams v aif, kirby j, [144], u v u, gummow & callinan jj, [80],[138] hayne j, [171], bolitho v cohen, [71], powell v ptolemy, [40]). this is also to say that if there is a conflict between the welfare or best interests of the child, on the one hand, and the legitimate interests and desires of the parents, on the other, priority must be given to the best interests of the child. (ams v aif, kirby j, [144], hayne j, [217-219], cf. goode v goode, [72]). c) freedom of movement of parents is a significant priority. that freedom is linked with the object of family law legislation to facilitate parties to a broken relationship to start a new life for themselves, including the possibility of forming a new relationship \u201cfree from unnecessary interference from a former spouse or partner or from a court.\u201d (ams v aif, kirby j, [145]. on \u201cfreedom of movement\u201d generally, see ams v aif, gleeson cj, mchugh & gummow jj, [40-45], gaudron j, [96], u v u, gummow & callinan jj, [89], cf. powell v ptolemy, [36]. inhibition of movement may impinge upon the happiness of the custodial parent, which may in turn be transmitted to the child. (ams v aif, kirby j, [145]).[139] freedom of movement, however, takes second place to the paramount interests of the child. d) there is no presumption in favour of a custodial parent to reside wherever he or she wishes. (ams v aif, kirby j, [146]). e) the applicant who seeks to relocate need not establish \u201ccompelling reasons\u201d for such a move. (ams v aif, gleeson cj, mchugh & gummow jj, [47], gaudron j, [92], kirby j, [191] & [195], hayne j, [209], u v u, gummow & callinan jj, [82]). nor does either party bear an onus to establish whether relocation is, or is not, in a child\u2019s best interests. f) transport and modern means of telecommunication may be relevant factors in making proper arrangements (\u201cnew and different facilities of access and contact ... with the other parent\u201d) as between a child and his or her non-resident parent, especially in relation to relocation within australia. ams v aif, kirby j, [147], [148 & 192], paskandy v paskandy, [57], cf. m v s and \u201cvirtual visitation\u201d [93]. g) in determining a relocation case that involves changed parenting arrangements, a court must evaluate each of the proposals advanced by the parties, without necessarily being bound by them. (u v u, gummow & callinan jj, [70 & 89], hayne j, [171] & [172], bolitho v cohen, [83-85]). put another way, without embarking upon \u201csome roving inquiry\u201d, and subject to the evidence led \u2013 and affording procedural fairness to all \u2013 a court will not necessarily be constrained solely by the proposals of the parties in determining what is in the best interests of the child. (u v u, hayne j, [172], bolitho v cohen, [84], powell v ptolemy, [40]). h) this summary of principle must, of course, be understood in the context of the \u2018prescribed legislative pathway\u2019 or scaffold in part vii of the act, to which i have already referred. thus, as stated by bryant cj and finn j, who constituted the majority in taylor v barker, at [53] (internal citations omitted): b) the over-arching issue is to ensure that any parenting order is in the best interests of the child. (ams v aif, kirby j, [144], u v u, gummow & callinan jj, [80],[138] hayne j, [171], bolitho v cohen, [71], powell v ptolemy, [40]). this is also to say that if there is a conflict between the welfare or best interests of the child, on the one hand, and the legitimate interests and desires of the parents, on the other, priority must be given to the best interests of the child.

[28] while the children\u2019s interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii of the act (ams v aif at 207, 225, 230, u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 (\u201cu v u\u201d) at 282). parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children (see ams v aif at 223-224, 231-232 ... only when the children\u2019s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent\u2019s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children\u2019s best interests (see u v u at 262). as the full court said in malcolm and munro [2011] famcafc 16, (2011) flc 93-460 at [83]: we emphasise that it is not the law that a parent wishing to relocate must establish compelling reasons for this to be permissible: see ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160, 179, and u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238, 259-260. equally, there is no onus on a parent who may be \u201cleft behind\u201d to demonstrate reasons as to why the other parent should not relocate. but it is properly part of a court\u2019s inquiry to consider what each parent proposes and to determine the context of those plans and reasons for them in determining what is in the best interests of a child. we agree with counsel for the mother that it was necessary for the primary judge to consider the totality of the evidence concerning family violence and reflect on the reality of how these parents could give effect to an order for equal shared parental responsibility before an order of that type could be made. to isolate the relevance of evidence of family violence merely to the application of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility was wrong. it was plainly relevant to the broader question of the allocation of parental responsibility once that issue was at large. we pause here to observe that the task before the primary judge was to determine what parenting orders were in the child\u2019s best interests. it was not to determine the location in which the mother was \u201cpermitted\u201d to live. the use of that phrase in the context that it was used tends to focus on the mother having to justify to the court where she wishes to live and obtain its approval. the use of that phrase obscures, if not overrides, the mother\u2019s undoubted right to live where she chooses as explained in ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 at [92] and [191] and u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 (\u201cu v u\u201d) at [37], [137] and [176]. consideration and disposition conclusion associate: dated: 31 august 2023 dated: 31 august 2023 [1] t 9.

setting out what the case law revealed as the \u201cpreferred approach\u201d to the determination of an application under s 79 of the act, referred to four inter-related steps, including that \u201cthe court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of ss. 79(4)(a), (b) and (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties\u201d... ] the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application pursuant to the provisions of section 79. that approach involves four interrelated steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (\u201cthe other factors\u201d) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

temporereasons for judgment judge o\u2019shannessy 1 these are my short form ex tempore reasons pursuant to section 69zl of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d). this matter was listed before me yesterday after being transferred from the docket of judge riethmuller (as his honour then was), and in the circumstances of a family emergency of one of the lawyers, was rolled over to today. the matter involves the children of the relationship, x and y both born in 2018 (\u201cthe children\u201d) who live with the mother, ms gadoury (\u201cthe mother\u201d), and what time the father, mr raddack (\u201cthe father\u201d), should spend with the children. 2 my decision is that for the next six weeks, the father\u2019s time should be supervised for one hour for the next three visits and two hours for the following three visits, but after the next six visits, which would be up to and concluding on the weekend of 11 and 12 december 2021, thereafter, the time should be unsupervised and it should be for four hours. for the first three visits, the father is at liberty to attend with only the paternal grandmother. thereafter, after those three visits, the father is at liberty to attend to have the paternal grandmother and the paternal grandfather if he wishes, but not the paternal grandfather alone. the time will then move to four hours without supervision. 3 the order for christmas eve should be for four hours not six: 12:00pm to 4:00pm. i am cognisant that there is a very significant period of travel time here. 4 the supervised time will be as directed by the service in accordance with the supervision agency. it will be as determined by the supervision agency as best affords the welfare and safety of the children. in other words, neither parent has the veto of where that facility is to be. i am not delegating that decision to the supervision service, but i do not have the information to choose which facility it should be at, but it should be determined with the assistance of that facility. 5 i note the mother's communication today via her solicitor that it is her firm and considered intention to cooperate with the supervision service. i am going to appoint an independent children's lawyer (\u201cicl\u201d) in the circumstances where there are allegations of child abuse. as to the birthday time, that will be as specified at 3(e) on the children's birthday by agreement and, failing agreement 4:00pm to 6.30pm. otherwise, the time will be from when the supervision ends on (the last session of supervised time will be in that week of 11 and 12 december), unsupervised. the time will then be alternating, it will be each weekend, but a saturday one weekend and a sunday one weekend. 6 the changeover point will be the suburb d mcdonald's halfway between the parties' homes. i have pondered whether the father should do all of the travel, but, in the circumstances where i am limiting the time to only four hours, the parties must share the travel. the matter will return before me on 7 february 2022 at 9.30am. 7 the mother must provide a copy of the mental health plan obtained from a general practitioner (as reported by her solicitor this day) to the father and the icl, but redacted of any details relating to the mother\u2019s medical condition save that that redaction shall not include redaction of the general practitioner\u2019s name and address. now, that does not mean everything can be redacted, but i am leaving it to the mother as to what should be redacted given the extreme private nature of such a document. 8 i decline to make the injunction that the parties be refrained from vaccinating the children in the circumstances where there is no risk that the father will somehow get the children vaccinated in the limited time he is going to have available with the children. i will note in the orders that the issue of vaccination, as well as time, will be alive on 7 february 2022. 9 there will be a direction that on or before 7 january 2022, each party provide to the other a list of such materials as they will seek to refer to on the issue of vaccination, including any to be referred to pursuant to section 144 of the evidence act 1995 (cth) on 7 february 2022. in other words, no one is to be ambushed by saying, \u201ci want you to read this document or that document or refer to this website or that website.\u201d further, any further material to be relied upon by either party is to be filed on or before monday, 31 january 2022. i really mean that. no more late filing of material. it is not just difficult for the judge, it is really difficult for the other party. 10 i may be able to deal with the vaccination dispute on the return and the parties should be alert that one way of dealing with a vaccination dispute is that one or other parent should have sole responsibility for the issue of vaccination, and that could be the mother or it could be the father, as opposed to me determining what is in the best interests of the children. it may be that i leave that as a parental decision. 11 i take into account all of the evidence. in particular, i take into account the chronology of supervised time as discussed with the parties\u2019 lawyers. i take into account the best interests of the children. i do not find on this interim hearing that there is an unacceptable risk of harm to the children from the father\u2019s care and attention to them or in regard to his grandparents\u2019 care and attention. the primary reason of continuing supervision is to assist the mother deal with what i regard as her obvious anxiety of having been the sole carer of these children, now for a number of years and being anxious and concerned about the extent to which the father can cope. i am heartened by his ability to cope in the very difficult circumstances of the supervision being in an open public place and the manner in which he calmly dealt with that. 12 i reject the argument that it is necessary for the father to have his mother (the paternal grandmother) present because he cannot cope, because of the common ground position that these children are not easy for a stranger to look after. they may well be much easier for the mother to look after in her home, however in my view, the mother has not appreciated how difficult it would be for the father, who is effectively getting to know these children, to care for them in an open public place like a park as she has insisted on to date. 13 i take into account the best interests of the children and the primary considerations of section 60cc of the act , both of them, and i give greater weight to the safety aspect of those primary considerations and i take into account the additional considerations of section 60cc(3)(a) through to (m). i do not apply the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility. it is not appropriate to apply that presumption at this interim hearing. 14 i have determined that this very restricted time in the unfortunate circumstances that the children have effectively only met their father twice in recent times and in the circumstances of the dynamics of their unusual behaviour as described in the report it is in the children\u2019s best interests that that time be limited at this stage. that is very limited time in the circumstances of the additional travel. i am aware of that. 15 regarding communication between the parents, that will be via the free app. my reasons for that is it is free and one of the parents has hitherto rejected the wizard app but seeks its use, notwithstanding the court order. it is not up to either parent to take it on themselves to determine these arrangements by themselves. because they cannot work it out the court is imposing these matters on them. that should be absolutely clear to both parents. 16 i also take into account the mother\u2019s allegations of a history of family violence and generally appalling comments from the father. there can be no doubt about the text message relating to breastfeeding that was made some three and a half years ago, and that does concern me. i take into account the other allegations that the mother makes in regard to the father\u2019s greeting to the children, which is denied, and i do not have the context surrounding that in any event and i do not have the context surrounding either communication, but i do not disregard them. 17 we will set the matter down for final hearing as a three-day matter, 30 january 2023. we will order a family report to be available. i will also order a transcript of the proceedings yesterday and this day to be available to the parties, including the icl. 18 i also will direct that the observation report be provided to any medical practitioner concerned with the mother, particularly in regard to her mental health plan, so that any medical practitioner has that information. in the event that the father consults any medical practitioner himself, he is at liberty to provide that supervision report to such medical practitioner. 19 within 14 days, the mother enrol in a parenting orders program and complete that as soon as possible. 20 there will be liberty to apply in the event there is further trouble, but i make it clear neither parent has a veto in regard to these arrangements. these arrangements that i am ordering are far from what the father wants, but he is not entitled to take it into his own hands and determine that he will keep the children, as he would have liked to. the mother is not entitled to take it into her own hands and either veto or limit time as she would like. associate: dated: 30 november 2021", "metadata": {"filename": "112.txt", "size": 28687, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1,

children about pursuing a relationship with the allegedly abusive parent rather than speaking in absolutes of one parent being wholly good and the other wholly bad it also does not explain why the children particularly [x] demonstrated a bond with [mr belloumi] in the previous assessments which has since deteriorated or why the children s dysregulation and behaviour has escalated in the absence of an increase in the spend time. it would be more common for the children to have presented in a consistent manner over time or for their distress to have been present during these earlier observations if the source of the resistance and refusal was to be solely attributed to [mr belloumi] further it would also not account for the observations of [s contact centre] that the children appear to find it difficult to allow themselves to have fun when with [mr belloumi] and deprive themselves of such activities in order to demonstrate their disdain for him. a further consideration is that the alleged distress and behavioural dysregulation of the children is not being reported in other settings for example [ms belloumi] indicated that the children were both doing well at school and

[a107] the finding that the adjustment in favour of the applicant was 8 percent was plainly wrong and inadequate in the circumstances including:- 8.1 the comparison between the parties\u2019 financial positions after the assessment of the contribution based entitlement. 8.2 the effect of the evidence that the loan between the respondent and his father would not be payable \u201cin the short to medium term\u201d. 8.3 the credit issues relating to the respondent and his father\u2019s evidence relating to the asserted loan. 8.4 the young age of the subject child and the applicant\u2019s financial responsibility towards that child for of period of at least 10 years. 8.5 the greater financial security of the respondent as opposed to the applicant. requirement for grounds to identify questions of law the following are generally regarded as questions of law: the following are not generally regarded as errors of law, consideration ground 1 \u2013 alleged failure to afford procedural fairness an arbitrator must conduct an arbitration with procedural fairness (for example, giving each party to the arbitration a reasonable opportunity to be heard and to respond to anything raised by another party). he rules of procedural fairness do not have immutably fixed content, the content of procedural fairness may vary according to the circumstances of the particular case. procedural fairness is essentially practical, it is not an abstract concept. the concern of the law is the avoidance of practical injustice. ... \u201c[t]he rules of procedural fairness do not have immutably fixed content ... \u2018[f]airness is not an abstract concept. it is essentially practical. whether one talks in terms of procedural fairness or natural justice, the concern of the law is to avoid practical injustice\u2019\u201d.[32] procedural fairness necessarily has a variable content, it can be \u201cprovided by different means in different contexts and may well be provided by different means in a single context\u201d.[33] it \u201cis defined by practical judgments about its content and application\u201d.[34] ground 2 \u2013 error in the exercise of discretion by asserted reliance on extraneous and irrelevant considerations in refusing the adjournment application take account of the duty imposed on the party by subsection (1) and (b) to assist the parties to comply with the duty. to encourage people to use dispute resolution mechanisms (other than judicial ones) to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made under this act, provided the mechanisms are appropriate in the circumstances and proper procedures are followed, and (c) to encourage people to use, in appropriate circumstances, arbitration to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made, and to provide ways of facilitating that use. to encourage people to use, in appropriate circumstances, arbitration to resolve matters in which a court order might otherwise be made, and to provide ways of facilitating that use. ground 3 \u2013 in finding that the wife\u2019s contributions to the asset pool justified a 22.5 per cent adjustment, the arbitrator was unreasonable and plainly unjust ground 4 \u2013 the arbitrator considered irrelevant matters 4.1 the wife took no steps to her detriment. [a57] 4.2 the wife did not pay rent for the last 18 months of cohabitation. [a57] (as per the original) the wife again took no step to her detriment. she did not sell her unit at [suburb e] to assist with the purchase or renovation, for example. she in fact invested none of her own money in the property. she has had the opportunity to live in a substantial family home in [suburb c] for the past three years without paying for the right to occupy it, including for nearly 18 months after separation. ground 5 \u2013 failure to properly balance the contributions of the wife as homemaker and parent with the financial contributions of the husband and [ground] 5, that is a question of his finding at paragraph 140. the argument there, the husband brought three times as much wealth to the relationship than did the wife, and further significant contributions were made by his father, and he renovated the property. but the wife gave evidence that she worked at the property. there\u2019s no comment about that in that paragraph, but he might be talking about financial contributions there. he did find, in paragraph 141, that the contributions were equal. ultimately, the husband brought almost three times as much wealth to a 4 year relationship than did the wife. further significant contributions were made by him by reason of the highly favourable arrangement to acquire the former matrimonial home with his father, arrangements which gave the parties an opportunity to accumulate significant wealth in the form of desirable property in [suburb c], property which the husband could afford to acquire and renovate himself using his pre-relationship property and with only modest indirect contribution by the wife to the [y bank] mortgage payments. otherwise, the parties had to contribute nothing at all to the acquisition and improvement of the property from their own resources, since the husband's father has never asked for any of the purchase price to be paid under the terms of the deed - and when he did, it seems he didn't mean what he said. these contributions arc weighed together with 5\u00bd years of personal exertion contributions which i found to be equal. ground 6 \u2013 asserted error in respect to various factual findings, leading to the arbitrator\u2019s finding that the alleged liability of $2.6 million would be repaid by the husband ground 7 \u2013 contention that the arbitrator\u2019s finding that \u201cit is unlikely [the loan of $2.6 million] will be called upon in the short to medium term\u201d was not supported by the evidence ...when it\u2019s coupled with the observation that it will be unlikely to be repaid in the short to medium term, that has to be taken into account somehow, and that\u2019s ignored, completely ignored. and that, your honour, has to be an error of law \u2013 just failed to consider that. having made the finding, he failed to then equate that to the balance sheet. ground 8 \u2013 the arbitrator\u2019s finding that the adjustment in favour of the wife was eight per cent was plainly wrong and inadequate in the circumstances conclusion costs associate: dated: 5 september 2023 dated: 5 september 2023 [1] review transcript 19 july 2023, p.5 line 38 and p.6 lines 18\u201320.[2] review transcript 19 july 2023, p.28 lines 3\u201310.

country is proof on the balance of probabilities. that remains so even where the matter to be proved involves criminal conduct or fraud. on the other hand, the strength of the evidence necessary to establish a fact or facts on the balance of probabilities may vary according to the nature of what is sought to prove. thus, authoritative statements have often been made to the effect that clear or cogent or strict proof is necessary \u201cwhere so serious a matter as fraud is to be found\u201d. statements to that effect should not, however, be understood as directed to the standard of proof. rather, they should be understood as merely reflecting a conventional perception that members of our society do not ordinarily engage in fraudulent or criminal conduct and a judicial approach that a court should not likely make a finding that, on the balance of probabilities, a party to civil litigation has been guilty of such conduct.\u2019 (citations omitted) (see also, the statement of dixon j

by the time of the first report in february 2021, x had been living with the mother for approximately four months. the first report records the following: by the time of the first report in february 2021, x had been living with the mother for approximately four months. the first report records the following: in relation to the current parenting arrangements, [x] was okay about spending time with his mother and acknowledged that his relationship with his mother had \u201ckind of changed, but we still fight. i don\u2019t hate her as much now. i used to, i didn\u2019t even want to call her mum before. my relationship was bad.\u201d however, [x] still maintained that he has more of a relationship with his father, asserting: \u201ci need to see my dad more. i spent more than 3 years with my dad, he was always there, my mum worked.\u201d [x] quickly defended that this was because of his father\u2019s workplace injury. by the time of the second report in january 2022, x and y had been living with the mother for approximately 15 months. asked by the report writer how he wanted to interact with his parents, x gave a more balanced view: in relation to his parents he says he wants to do 'mix mix'. he wants to see his father for more than an hour and a half. he wants to see his father for a couple of days a week. it makes him feel bad about his life because he can not. he sees most people with their mother and father and he is the only one who sees their father for an hour or so, supervised at a dffh office in [suburb q]. he wants to have some days at his mother's and some days at his father's. the third report from ms n is dated 12 may 2023. x had, by that stage, been back living with his father for some months. x told ms n that his mother \u2018acts all nice and friendly in front of other people but on your own she doesn\u2019t speak nicely\u2019. he described his relationship with his father as \u2018a hundred million times better than my relationship with mum\u2019. he told ms n that he wanted to \u2018live with his father and make his own decisions about seeing his mother which at the moment he does not want to do\u2019. section 60cc(3)(a) - views expressed by the child, etc nature of the child\u2019s relationship with each of the parents and other persons extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to spend time or communicate with the child, or participate in making decisions following the making of the interim orders in september 2020, the father did not initiate supervision with the family contact service and as a result, did not spend any time with x and y for several months after they came into her care, (b) on 26 october 2020, the father\u2019s solicitors advised that he was unable to pay for private supervision and requested that supervised time occur with m contact service, which the mother almost immediately agreed to, and (c) notwithstanding the above, the father then spent only limited time with x and y on four occasions being 2 may 2021, 13 june 2021, 27 june 2021 and 11 july 2021. on 26 october 2020, the father\u2019s solicitors advised that he was unable to pay for private supervision and requested that supervised time occur with m contact service, which the mother almost immediately agreed to, and (c) notwithstanding the above, the father then spent only

occasions being 2 may 2021, 13 june 2021, 27 june 2021 and 11 july 2021. the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the child the likely effect of any changes in the child\u2019s circumstances, etc. making the orders sought by the father will mean that y will need to transition between the parents in order to spend time with the mother. the overwhelming evidence in this case is that there is conflict between the parents whenever a transition occurs. that conflict can take many forms, including, as has occurred in the past, the father withholding y. there is every prospect that y will be exposed to such conflict and every prospect that such conflict will unsettle him, and (b) a notable feature of this case is that z and x have both had issues with aggression that have led to troubles at school, and with the authorities. this has occurred predominantly while both z and x have lived with the father. it is a matter reported on by dhhs. there is some prospect of this pattern being repeated. a notable feature of this case is that z and x have both had issues with aggression that have led to troubles at

repeated. practical difficulty and expense of the child spending time with and communicating with a parent, etc the father\u2019s evidence, at one point, was that he cannot afford to pay for supervised time with y, should that be ordered. if he lacks capacity to pay, that will affect his ability to spend time with y if supervised time is ordered, (b) the mother\u2019s evidence is that when she attempted to have video calls with y, the father and y\u2019s brothers were always in the background. i accept this evidence and accept that her time with y was interrupted, and (c) there is a high probability that y will be discouraged from seeing his mother at all if he goes to live with his father and his brothers. the mother\u2019s evidence is that when she attempted to have video

and (c) the father has engaged in coercive and controlling behaviour in the way he coerced w and his engagement with the mother at least in the early stages of this second round of litigation. there

contribution to town hh and the proceeds arising from the sale of the two tasmanian properties and therefore no adjustment was needed to be made and rather the husband should retain the full benefit of those interests, (b) the contributions of the parties\u2019 to the rest of their non-superannuation property interests meant that the wife should receive 75% of the sale money, and (c) the contributions of the parties\u2019 to their superannuation interests meant that the wife should retain her superannuation and 25% of the husband\u2019s superannuation with superannuation fund 1. the

settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. so much follows from the text of section 79(1)(a) itself, which refers to \u201caltering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property\u201d. the question posed by section 79(2) is thus whether, having regard to those existing interests, the court is satisfied that it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order. ordinarily, where a particular interest is property of the parties or either of them it may be the subject of a direct order under section 79. on the other hand, if it is not property but a \u201cfinancial resource\u201d, a direct order may not be made in relation to it, but it may be taken into account in deciding what orders to make in respect of any property of the parties. the above statement is subject to the qualification that the concept of what is \u201cproperty\u201d is very wide, but there may be property in relation to which it is either impracticable or inappropriate to make a direct order. emphasis) table 1 \u2013 schedule of wife\u2019s property interests

alone of that approach, authority eschews \u201coverly pernickety analysis\u201d and section 79 demands neither an audit nor an exercise in accounting. however, when significant sums of money are said by one party or the other to have been \u201cwasted\u201d or to amount to a unilateral \u201cpremature distribution of property\u201d and the evidence is suggestive of either or both, an analysis of the relevant sums and their use is needed. the limited scope of the outstanding disclosure asserted within the wife\u2019s typed list of issues[25] and the lack of more recent correspondence (perhaps

[x] described his father in wholly negative terms (\u2018bad and always mean\u2019). he said that his father \u2018yells a lot\u2019 and added \u2018i hate him, i don\u2019t like him at all\u2019. [x] spoke about being frightened of [the father] and scared for his and [the mother\u2019s] safety when his father was also present. he said that his father behaved in an aggressive way towards him and his mother. for example, [x] said that his father said \u2018bad\u2019 things to his mother including the \u2018f-word, b-word and m-word\u2019. when asked to explain the meaning of each letter, [x] whispered \u2018fuck, bitch and motherfucker\u2019. ... he has been exposed to family violence and has been in situations and/or exposed to incidents which have made him feel unsafe and frightened. this has resulted in [x] worrying (and possibly being preoccupied with worry) about his and his mother\u2019s safety. [x] appears to have cut/split off from feeling anything positive towards [the father]. it is possible that, due to his young age and stage of development, this is the only way he can manage and tolerate the intense negative feelings he has towards his father. it is also very likely that [x] has taken on a protective role towards [the mother] that is beyond his young age and capability, and this has emotionally burdened him. (bold emphasis added) ... the most immediate and pressing need for [x] is for him to be protected from harm - physical, emotional, and psychological - whether direct or indirect, and be given some reprieve from the immense pressure of feeling caught in the middle of his parents and worrying about his and his mother\u2019s safety. [x] also needs for his mother to regain control over her emotional and psychological health and wellbeing (through counselling) so that she can continue to give priority to his needs and protection. expecting [x] to have any contact with [the father] would likely place him ([x]) under considerable pressure, which could have a deleterious impact on his emotional and psychological wellbeing, and this is not in his best interests. single expert report offered that he does not like calling him dad. he said he calls him you-know-who. [x] said he does not like his father\u2019s real name or the d. a. d (as he spelt) word and said he thinks the best word for him is you-know-who. when asked how he came to arrive at you-know-who being the best word for dad, [x] said it was him. [x] said he does not want to be reminded of him by the word because he has done really bad things and made him upset. when asked if he remembered any of these things, [x] said he remembered some of them but not all of them because he is not trying to remember because he is trying to live his life. impressed as possibly irrevocably impacted by his experiences of family life pre-separation. he is closely engaged with his mother in their new life, attending a new school and living in a home whose address he is pleased that is unknown to [the father]. he seems to have adopted the psychological strategies of expunging [the father], the strategies being never referring to [the father] as dad but rather as you-know-who, not wishing to think or talk about his father, doing his best to forget [the father], rejecting him as part of the family, and wishing him to be incarcerated or dead. [x] has become split in his relationships with his parents, fully aligned with [the mother] who he experiences as caring, fun and protective, and [the father] who he rejects as a bad, troublesome person who he hates. presently does not have a connection with his father. the crux of the family law dispute is whether or not it is safe for [x] to spend time with [the father] and, if so, how their relationship should proceed, and in what shape and form. the law primary considerations the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. meaningful relationship ... should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child\u2019s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents ... no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child\u2019s best interests. family violence fogarty j stated it is necessary for a trial judge to give real and substantial consideration to the facts of the case and to decide whether or not, and why or why not, those facts could be said to raise an unacceptable risk of harm to the child (at 82,713-82,714) and, furthermore, the qualitative analysis of the evidence must be directed not just to the existence of the risk of harm but also the magnitude of the possible harm (at 82,714). and agreed with and adopted the dissenting judgment of austin j in fitzwater & fitzwater [2019] famcafc 251, (2019) 60 fam lr 212 as being the correct statement of the law. his honour\u2019s judgment includes the following: the assessment of risk is a predictive exercise and while it is, naturally enough, liable to be influenced by factual findings about past events, the contemplation of risk entails the foresight of possible harm. it is an oddity to expect that the mere possibility of future harm can or should be proven as a probability, as has been implied before (potter and potter [2007] famca 350, (2007) flc 93-326 at [110], [129]). risks of harm must be heeded even if they are improbable eventualities. speaking of the risk of some future occurrence is just another way of expressing the chance of it happening. the concept of chance lies along a continuum, encompassing all outcomes which lie in the range between highly probable and remotely possible, assuming the polar extremes of certainty are ignored. in the current context, the higher the chance of the children\u2019s sexual abuse, the greater the risk of their physical or psychological harm. at some point on the continuum the risk of such harm becomes so potent it cannot be tolerated: it is unacceptable. family violence discussion sexual violence late 2014: hitting x and the mother in bed early 2015: tea towel 2015: dog vomit late 2015: queensland trip her honour: well, it was more than that. you said, \u2018it was quite a scene\u201d?---it was quite a scene, yes, so yes. so, what do you mean by that?---i mean yelling, screaming. i mean she definitely took it and ran in the hotel room. i never grabbed her or threw her into a wall, but yes, it wasn\u2019t - it wasn\u2019t - it wasn\u2019t pleasant. i didn\u2019t think there was any need for - for the - the marijuana to be taken and as - that to happen in the first place. granted, shouldn\u2019t be smoking marijuana, all the rest of it, but i don\u2019t feel like that was necessarily required at the time, but nor was my reaction. so, i think between the two of us, it was, as i say, it was a scene, yes. mr squires: okay. when you say your reaction, what do you mean by that, that you say, nor was your reaction?---well, i just wasn\u2019t happy that it was taken. all right?---yes. so, yes. her honour: so, you had been smoking an illegal substance on your trip up from sydney to [region m], is that right?---at times, yes, of an - once we finished driving, not when i was driving. had you - - - mr cohen: your honour, just to clarify that, it\u2019s not actually an illegal substance. it\u2019s an illegal substance without a script, but i mean, that\u2019s - i don\u2019t know whether it takes things much further. her honour: did you have a script?---no, not at the time. thank you. and on the evening, or when you were in the hotel, had you smoked marijuana that - - -?---before this? yes?---no. had you smoked marijuana that day?---no. when you - when the mother took the marijuana from you, you said that you were yelling and screaming. was [x] in the room when that happened?---yes, [x] would have been around, yes. was [x] in the room when the mother ran away, using your words, with the marijuana?---yes, he would have been. he\u2019s only one so he was with us at pretty well the whole time, you know. where did the mother run to?---just around the bed. all right. and did you follow her?---yes. did [x] see that?---i\u2019m not sure. i mean, he was only one, he - he was - he may well have been in the - - - that was in his presence though?---yes, correct. and did you continue to yell and scream while you were following the mother around the bed?---wasn\u2019t yelling and screaming the whole time, no. i mean, there was two people yelling at each other, but no. did you yell and scream as you followed the mother around the bed?---quite possibly, yes, yes. did the mother yell and scream as she was leaving you around the bed?---yes. there was screaming both ways, yes. yelling rather than screaming, yelling. when you say then that it was quite a scene, you say that you took the marijuana, \u2018i just took it back,\u2019 is what you said, did you take it from the mother\u2019s hand?---i can\u2019t recall. it\u2019s possible, yes. because you did say you took it from her hand, and then you said you were not sure?---yes. so, i want you to think about that. did you take it from her hand?---i can\u2019t be exactly sure, but yes, it\u2019s certainly possible, yes. i mean, it\u2019s - it was quite a while - - - well, was the mother willing to give it to you at that point?---i\u2019m not sure. well, think about it?---like i say, it - it sort of - it got to the point where the argument was going nowhere and i think it was a combination of giving it back or - - - no, that\u2019s not my question. my question was, when you took it from her hand, was the mother willing to give it to you?---probably not, no. yes. so, it\u2019s likely, isn\u2019t it, that the mother - from the mother\u2019s perspective at the very least, you snatched something from her hand?---yes. and that thing that you\u2019ve snatched was your marijuana?---yes. did you then leave the room immediately?---i believe so, yes. did you slam the door or anything like that?---no. okay. what - did you smoke marijuana when you left the room?---no, i don\u2019t believe so, no. all right. are you sure about that?---yes. in late 2016: verbal abuse, physical abuse and property damage by the father while intoxicated the father appeared

seriously because, in the toy room [in mid] 2015, you had talked about [self-harm] the evening you drew the sketch board. did you have a conversation with the mother to that effect [in mid] 2015, [mr halliday]?--- not that i\u2019m aware of. i mean, it\u2019s possible there was a conversation talking about [self-harm]. i don\u2019t believe so. but yes, there was periods where i wasn\u2019t in the best way throughout the relationship. and that that could well be a time, yes. it\u2019s an admission that i drew the image, not an admission that i drew [x]. i think we need to be clear where the - where it sits. ms k e father] denied that he engaged in a pattern of coercive controlling family violence. he strongly denied that he physically, verbally, emotionally and psychologically abused his former partner. her honour: ... when he said that he behaved aggressively, did he - did you take it to mean that having made that admission, he still validly maintained that he was denying physical, verbal, emotional, psychological abuse?--- yes. the mother\u2019s mental health ... communicating with [the father] was very anxiety provoking for [the mother] and she encouraged her to set boundaries to alleviate such. [ms j] said that she would not see [the mother]\u2019s level of anxiety subsiding if she were required to have future communication with [the father]. she said that if she communicates with [the father], [the father] ends up back in her head. the details of the descriptions of [the father]\u2019s behaviour, her behaviour in response, and [x]\u2019s reactions, would suggest a narrative that comes from her experiences in the relationship with [the father]. her level of distress, on recall of the incidences, suggests that her feelings are triggered by memories which are traumatic. [the mother] would appear to have experienced family violence with resultant emotional trauma, a not uncommon legacy of experiences of family violence. oral evidence of the family consultant firstly, i would like to say that interview almost took my breath away in terms of the strength and the negativity of [x]\u2019s comments about his father. they are very troubling. they would reflect probably a range of things. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s simply one directional here. i don\u2019t think it\u2019s simply a matter of [x] observed or witnessed something [sic] and therefore has arrived at this point. i don\u2019t actually think that\u2019s the case. i think [x] has been exposed to dynamics which are probably incorporating a range of negative interactions between his parents, overlaid with then what i\u2019ve described in my report as - as quite potent and a pattern of family violence. so i think we\u2019ve got both of those things - cycles going. and then we\u2019ve got mum\u2019s reaction and responses, which typically are going to be emotional. there\u2019s not going to be a rational, generally, response. they will be from a place of - you know, if mum\u2019s account is correct and what i have assessed is most likely correct then her responses are going to be of a place of trauma. and then you have that cycle impacting on [x] and his view of dad. and you would then, beyond that, have feedback loops going on between the two of them around probably anxiety to the point of phobia. and we know that anxiety transmits. it\u2019s one of the few mental health conditions that actually literally transmits. and particularly between parents who have experienced family violence and their children. so trying to break those cycles is probably number one, i would think, for [x] at the moment. and that\u2019s why i suggested the no-time. ... [x]\u2019s interview speaks of trauma. so it\u2019s not [x] saying i would like to not see dad. it\u2019s so his message is coming from, i think, a place of trauma. and the words are almost secondary. it\u2019s the tone, it\u2019s the negativity, it\u2019s the strength of his position that i think are - are his sort of global views as opposed to his distinct wishes. and, i agree, i don\u2019t think a child of his age\u2019s distinct wishes should drive but we certainly have to take into account the place that a child has arrived emotionally at age nine. and if that\u2019s a place which they\u2019re yelling out loud that they don\u2019t wish to be, then we\u2019ve got to take that into account. it\u2019s just reinforcing, it\u2019s just another - another layer for [x] to deal with, another emotional challenge, more reminders of, you know, the - the past, incidents of the past, even, let\u2019s be frank, conversations that, you know, mum might have had that he has overheard. so more reminders. so taking him backwards rather than forwards. does not have the emotional reserve or will to see his father and that [the mother] does not have the confidence in [the father] or belief that she could, or it would be of benefit to [x] for her to support [x] to see [the father]. it is suggested that [x] and [the mother] should now be free to build their life absent of any need to consider contact with [the father]. ... the psychological risk to [x] of not seeing his father is something haven\u2019t we [sic] been talking about. and that is very relevant. i would like to have been able to write a report to be able to enable [x] to be able to [sic] spend time with his father. but - and i think [mr halliday] has, you know, very many attributes which would enable him to be a good father to [x]. but the point that everyone has arrived at here is that [x] now is estranged from his father. he can\u2019t even contemplate his father. his therapist thinks that [x]\u2019s going to benefit very much from pretty well getting on with life and being a child of his age, rather than any more years being consumed by the question of whether to re-engage with dad. i think that\u2019s how i would put it. and i think that\u2019s why [sic] my assessment tells me too. even though i don\u2019t like that idea very much at all for [x], i would much prefer [x] had an opportunity to resolve this - you know, we could say hatred for his father. i would like that but i don\u2019t think it\u2019s realistic. and i think weighing up the risks to him, he needs to have some years before adolescence of getting on with childhood, being relieved of being at the centre of what are some really serious troubling dynamics in the family. being protected from that. and that might give [x] the best chance of a reconnection later on. and, you know, maybe not too later on but some connection later on. ... we need to get back to [x]. [x] is the child - is a - is - is the person in this situation who has this great psychological risk of not having a father in his life. that is - that is a risk. that is - that is a very important aspect of this report, that this loss, this potential abandonment, this - \u2018my father is actually still alive. he hasn\u2019t died. we haven\u2019t had a funeral. we haven\u2019t had all the gestures around that kind of loss\u2019. this is very complicated for [x]. [x]\u2019s trauma right now - response is probably as much, or at least in part, due to that fact as well as his experiences with his parents. so to preserve the potential from [sic] him reconnecting with his father, i would say, is... very high on my priorities of writing this report. additional considerations any views expressed by the child the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parents and other persons the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with the child the capacity of each parent to provide for x\u2019s needs, including emotional and intellectual needs the parents\u2019 attitudes to the child and responsibilities of parenthood the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has fulfilled, or failed to fulfil, their obligations to maintain the child the likely effect of any change in the child\u2019s circumstances family violence conclusion assessment of risk conclusion parental responsibility spend time orders overseas travel the existence or otherwise of continuing ties between the departing parent and australia, (b) the existence and strength of possible motives not to return, (c) the existence and strength of possible motives to remain in the other country, (d) whether the country of travel is a signatory to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction signed on 25 october 1980, and (e) other considerations in section 60cc of the act as are relevant.[100] the existence and strength of possible motives not to return, (c) the existence and strength of possible motives to remain in the other country, (d) whether the country of travel is a signatory to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction signed on 25 october 1980, and (e) other considerations in section 60cc of the act as are relevant.[100] the existence and strength of possible motives to remain in the other country, (d) whether the country of travel is a signatory to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction signed on 25 october 1980, and (e) other considerations in section 60cc of the act as are relevant.[100] whether the country of travel is a signatory to the hague convention on the civil aspects of international child abduction signed on 25 october 1980, and (e) other considerations in section 60cc of the act as are relevant.[100] other considerations in section 60cc of the act as are relevant.[100] gifts and presents injunctions associate: dated: 8 september 2023 dated: 8 september 2023 [1] whisprun pty ltd v dixon [2003] hca 48;

in the event either parent is unable to care for x for a period of 3 days or longer, then the other parent shall have the first option to care for the child during the period that the first parent is unavailable. the court further notes that: reasons for judgment judge w j neville: introduction 1 the final hearing in this matter took place on 22nd october 2021. noting the prodigious personal and financial costs already incurred, which has already included an unsuccessful appeal in 2020, the parties have sensibly now resolved the majority of the parenting issues between them regarding their daughter, now almost 4\u00bd year old, x (so-called in her mother\u2019s household), and called x in her father\u2019s.[1] 2 notwithstanding a very significant degree of micro-management already undertaken, there remain outstanding, however, three discrete matters: (a) how best to transition the child, who will turn 5 in july 2022, into living in a week about arrangement between the parties, (b) whether the nominated agent, for the purposes of changeover, needs to be agreed in writing between (and thereby notified to) the parties prior to changeover, and (c) whether the court should make a \u201cfirst option to care\u201d order. 3 in the various submissions, set out below, neither case law of any kind, nor any section of the family law act 1975 (cth (\u201cthe act\u201d) was cited, such as s.60ca regarding \u201cbest interests.\u201d i mention this not as any criticism but simply to highlight (if such be needed) (i) the narrowness of the contest now, and (b) within such narrow confines but still in the exercise of a wide discretion, the ambit of the largely factual (and/or logistical) dispute hardly requires the recitation, or engagement, of detailed legal or statutory principle. as always, the simple point of reference is the \u201cbest interests\u201d of this young and otherwise flourishing child over whom the parents both dote, and tragically fight, almost like a spoil of some gargantuan battle. one hates to contemplate what the parents might otherwise be doing with their time, energy and funds, apart from expending all of that on x rather than on the lawyers. such is so often the nature of family law litigation \u2013 win at all costs, but neither family nor the child really wins at all. a genuine but common lament. 4 again by way of general observation only, if the art of parenting invariably operates best on the basis of, for example, simplicity of arrangements and orders, the orders proposed by the parties are, in large part, anything but straight-forward. that said, regularly they seem to have been able to make complicated arrangements, including multiple (and doubtless exhausting) changeovers, work. fortunately indeed, most happily, x seems to be thriving whatever and however the level of contest between her parents. 5 before proceeding further, i remind at least myself of the broad discretion exercised by courts that deal with family law matters. although i have referred to it already in general terms, and do so again later in these reasons, i recall the hardly novel but important proposition from the high court in cdj v vaj, now a few decades ago even if for some they seem still to be almost like yesterday.[2] regarding the exercise of discretion in family law litigation, the plurality in the high court (mchugh, gummow and callinan jj) said at [152]: it is a mistake to think that there is always only one right answer to the question of what the best interests of a child require. each judge is duty bound to make the order which he or she thinks is in the best interests of the child. but the fact that other judges think that the best interests of that child require a different order does not necessarily prove that the first order was not in the best interests of the child. best interests are values, not facts. they involve a discretionary judgment in respect of which judges can come to opposite but reasonable conclusions. in g v g [1985] flr 894 at 897-898, lord fraser of tullybelton pointed out: \"the jurisdiction in such cases is one of great difficulty, as every judge who has had to exercise it must be aware. the main reason is that in most of these cases there is no right answer. all practicable answers are to some extent unsatisfactory and therefore to some extent wrong, and the best that can be done is to find an answer that is reasonably satisfactory.\" orders sought 6 the parties provided to the court a minute reflecting the orders sought by each of them in relation to these discrete matters. those respective minutes were as follows. in the course of the hearing, other configurations of alternative time-with arrangements were canvassed and submissions made, which i need not here recount further. minute of orders sought by the mother 1. that from 25 october 2021 until 10 july 2022, the child spends equal time with each parent at times to be agreed between the parties

the court have had a long report from mr b, dated 13th march 2020. there is also a more recent report from the family consultant, ms e, dated 17th august 2021, which became exhibit a. ms e gave some brief oral evidence at the trial. given the narrowness of the dispute and, given the discretion involved, ms e could not and did not offer much more other than what was in her report, not least because there was (and is) no fixed answer to any of the remaining issues. indeed, there are arguable grounds to support the positions of either party.[3] 8 there is also before the court, attached to one or both of the party\u2019s affidavits, certain records from the child care centre the child attends every day. together with the reports referred to, those records show how well she is doing. likewise, the family reports referred to confirm that x has a good and close relationship with both of her parents. such a critical matter is not in contest. it follows that there are no relevant issues of \u201crisk\u201d regarding the child in the care of either parent. of course, this is not the first family law matter where the crux of the unresolved issues is not with the child per se but rather with the parents and their co-parenting relationship \u2013 or the regular hiccups in it. 9 the final orders agreed between the parties provide, most notably, for the parties to have equal shared parental responsibly for x. the agreed orders also deal with matters such as school holiday time, special occasions, facetime communication, and travel. during the course of the final hearing, the parties also agreed to interim \u201ctime with\u201d arrangements of a 2/2/3 configuration that will continue until 10 july 2022. 10 at the conclusion of the final hearing, and in the light of some concern if not trepidation (feigned or real is not known) by the mother\u2019s counsel, the court managed to indicate that it thought that a judgment on the outstanding issues could or would be reasonably comfortably managed prior to july 2022! to assist the parties to bring a relevant degree of closure to their long-running parenting dispute, and to enable them to move on with their lives with a degree of greater certainty than has perhaps been the case over the last few years due to ongoing court involvement, the abbreviated oral reasons sought somewhat summarily to provide both an outline of the parties\u2019 respective positions, and to set out the court\u2019s reasons and decision in relation to the limited issues that remain unresolved. because that has now proved to be insufficient for the father\u2019s purposes, it has become necessary, as already noted, to put the reasons into written form. 11 without rehearsing in too much detail the arguments/submissions of the parties, in my view, the following orders are in x\u2019s best interests pursuant to the statutory requirement in s.60ca of the act. for convenience and overview, however, the general written submissions of the parties taken from their respective outline of case documents are annexed to these reasons at annexures b and c. this is also to indicate generally that, as with most family law parenting matters, there is regularly no simple, black and white answer, primarily because life is more often than not made up of all manner of colours, shades and hues. it follows that, absent abundantly clear evidence one way or the other, there are reasonable arguments on both sides for the propositions and orders advanced by both the father and the mother. as is usually the case in family law matters, orders regularly involve a balancing act of sorts, with as much delicacy as is possible in all of the circumstances. 12 it is important to note that x has been in a shared care/equal time arrangement with the parties since consent orders were made on 12th december 2019, thus, when she was very young. although it is highly unusual to have a shared care arrangement for such a young child, and notwithstanding the mother\u2019s not infrequent contention that this arrangement was effectively imposed upon her by the father who would not accept anything else, for a number of reasons, some being pragmatic considerations, the parties agreed upon a shared care arrangement more than 2 years ago. such matters were canvassed in the court\u2019s judgment in october 2020, which decision was not disturbed on appeal in april 2021.[4] in no pejorative or hyper-critical way, i hope all of that time and the resources expended with the hearing/appeal were worth it. i mention these matters only to record the court\u2019s genuine concern about the time, delay and consumption of resources that so regularly characterise family law litigation. 13 to add further force to these observations and those that follow, i need only note that in the mother\u2019s outline of case document (filed 15th october 2021) she stated (p.4, \u201cparental responsibility\u201d: par.2): this matter is relatively straight-forward. the court is faced with two good parents each with a good relationship with the child. they have fundamentally different views of what time arrangement best meets her best interests. 14 in my view, this fairly describes the situation that confronts the parents, and the court. it also reflects the reality of the high court\u2019s comments in cdj v vaj noted earlier in these reasons. however, as is often the case in family law litigation, one or other parent in the current matter has insisted on his or her view as being paramount and \u201cbest\u201d because each, in his or her own way, knows better than the other parent. one or other of them insists that he or she is \u201cright\u201d, and therefore the other parent is \u201cwrong.\u201d unfortunately, such a hard-line approach is less than conducive to good co-parenting. it often means that one or other parent misses (or mistakes) the proverbial wood for the trees. issue i: time-with arrangements 15 the mother\u2019s position in relation to the time with arrangements was as follows. 16 she seeks that from 11th july 2022 the parties move to a 9/5 arrangement, with the child living primarily with her and spending 5 nights per fortnight with the father at times to be agreed. she further seeks that this time be configured on a 3/2 basis to ensure that the child is not separated from either parent for too long a period. this arrangement would continue until term 1 in 2024 at which point the parties would move to a week about arrangement, but with one night in the off-week with the non-resident parent. the parties would subsequently move to a week about arrangement in term 1 of 2025 but with no single night in the off-week with the non-resident parent. at this stage of course, the child will be 7\u00bd years old. doubtless quite the young lady. 17 the mother contends that this transition will best manage x\u2019s developmental needs and slowly grow the period of time that the child spends away from her mother, who also contends that she is the primary carer for the child. the father disputes the mother\u2019s primary care contention. 18 the mother has previously, and continues, to raise concerns about the child\u2019s unsettled behaviour (e.g. being clingy and upset at the end of her time with the mother) in this equal care arrangement. she contends that these concerns were raised prior to the commencement of court proceedings, and even prior to the mother connecting them to the impact on the child of the equal time arrangement. it should be noted that neither the father, nor ms e (the family consultant), reports observing such behaviour in the child. 19 the mother submitted that her proposed orders address any risk of possible future harm arising from the child of having spent this alleged unsettled period of equal time as a very young child. such matters were briefly raised by the family consultant, who also agreed that there was no evidence to support any such matters at this time. her comments were necessarily rather speculative, as she also agreed that the child may ultimately suffer no such concerns or issues. in the mother\u2019s view, her orders provide for a period of consolidation to ensure that any latent or other attachment issues that may arise in the future are relevantly resolved. 20 the father\u2019s position in relation to the time with arrangements was as follows. 21 he seeks that from 11th july 2022 until 30th january 2024, the child live in a shared care, 5/2/5/2 (or similar) arrangement. following that, the child would move to living with the parties in a more conventional, week-about arrangement. 22 as noted already, the father disputes the mother\u2019s contention that she is the child\u2019s primary carer, as the child has been in the equal care of both parents since separation and therefore the child has a close, loving and secure attachment with both parents. the father contends that the hypotheticals raised in the family report regarding the risks to the child of being removed from their primary care giver is not available on the evidence. 23 counsel for the father also submitted that the 5/2/5/2 arrangement is in x\u2019s best interests. the father\u2019s perspective is that the child would not be ready to transition to an extended period away from the father, as the mother\u2019s 5/9 arrangement would seek him have. the father contends that there is a real risk of the child feeling a deep sense of loss if that arrangement were to be implemented. 24 counsel for the father also noted that there is no independent evidence that the child could (or would) be able to cope spending extended periods away from the father but not able to cope spending a similar time away from the mother. 25 the father saw no merit in not transitioning immediately to week about in 2024, and thought the inclusion of the overnight time in the off-week imposed an extra level of complication that was not necessary. further, by that time, on either of the parties\u2019 proposal, the child would have spent a significant period away from each parent. as an observation only, given how the child and her parents have endured so many changeovers over the years, it is difficult to see how a mid-week overnight in the of-week would be very disturbing at all \u2013 for anyone, least of all x. 26 i simply note again that the issue is not whether there should be a transition in the time-with arrangements, the only issues are when and how. in my view, perhaps unsurprisingly, the better course is for the following regime of transitioning, which seeks to strike a measured balance, in the light of the paucity of evidence (other than the most recent report of ms e and her very limited oral evidence), and in the light of the brief oral submissions of counsel for each party. i note too that the court has obviously taken account of (a) the age of the child, (b) the long-standing arrangements where she has transitioned often between her parents, and (c) she spends very regular time in child care, thereby suggesting (especially in the light of the reports from the day-care centre) that she spends significant periods of time away from both of her parents and that she has adapted, apparently well, to regular engagement with others. it almost became a question of the perception of each parent was to what was/is best for the child, noting again how well she is generally doing. again, and in no hyper-critical way, there was little evidence referred to in counsels\u2019 submissions, and no relevant \u201cprinciple\u201d other than general references as to what is or would be best for the child. 27 in the light of the above, absent any other agreement in writing between the parties, in my view, the following orders are in the child\u2019s best interests, which are, effectively, little more than a variation on a theme, albeit two competing \u201cthemes\u201d by each of the parents: (a) from 11th july 2022 until 31st december 2022, x shall live with her mother for 9 nights per fortnight and with her father for 5 nights per fortnight, configured as proposed by the mother of 3/2, and perhaps then 2/3, but whichever is the least disruptive and most practical, (b) from 1st january 2023 until 31st december 2023, x live with her mother for 8 nights per fortnight and with her father for 6 nights, configured on a 4/4/4/2 (or as otherwise agreed), (c) from 1st january 2024 until 10th july 2024, x shall spend equal time with each parent on a \u2018week-about\u2019 basis, save that the child shall spend one overnight with the other parent in the off-week (d) from 11th july 2024, x shall spend equal time with each parent on a \u2018week about\u2019 basis. from 11th july 2022 until 31st december 2022, x shall live with her mother for 9 nights per fortnight and with her father for 5 nights per fortnight, configured as proposed by the mother of 3/2, and perhaps then 2/3, but whichever is the least disruptive and most practical, (b) from 1st january 2023 until 31st december 2023, x live with her mother for 8 nights per fortnight and with her father for 6 nights, configured on a 4/4/4/2 (or as otherwise agreed), (c) from 1st january 2024 until 10th july 2024, x shall spend equal time with each parent on a \u2018week-about\u2019 basis, save that the child shall spend one overnight with the other parent in the off-week (d) from 11th july 2024, x shall spend equal time with each parent on a \u2018week about\u2019 basis. issue ii: pick up agent 28 this is not an issue out of a james bond movie! in terms of what will be called the \u201cpick-up agent issue\u201d, the mother seeks that the parties agree prior to changeovers that occur in person on who any pick-up agent will be. the father submitted that he did not see the need to be that restrictive, as the only people attending changeover (presumably in the vast majority of circumstances either at day care or at school) would be the parents themselves, his partner or perhaps other family members from time to time. 29 respectfully, not for the first time, as apparently anxious as one or other parent might be, perhaps most notably the mother, given how robust the child is, and that the real issues most regularly relate to the parents\u2019 almost regular and fierce inability to work things out and therefore spend money on lawyers to do so, accepting that actually many things have been worked out more than satisfactorily over the years, in my view, this is an issue in search of a genuine foundation. in my view, the overwhelming majority of parents never see this aspect of co-parenting as an issue. it should not be so here. it is, at its highest, nothing more than (and nothing less than) basic courtesy to let the other parent know if there is a problem in the child being picked up and that it will occur with the assistance of another member of the family. there are no so-called risk issues set out in any of the material regarding either of the parties or any member of their respective families. as children get older, so-called helicopter parents only end up causing more problems than solving them. 30 in my view, to the degree that the court can or should get involved in more micro-management of daily decisions regarding the child, any family member of either parent may pick up the child that would otherwise occur or be undertaken by the other parent. the court should not have to legislate for basic issues of courtesy such as informing the other parent of another member of the family to pick up the child from day care or school. absent some identifiable issue or relevant \u201crisk\u201d, any member of each party\u2019s family may pick up the child in any circumstance when the scheduled parent is unable to do so. 31 lest it also be necessary to state: that singular but often missing quality, usually called \u201ccommon sense\u201d, would dictate that neither parent shall attend day care or the school when the other parent is scheduled to pick up the child. distance between parents is usually a practical course to avoid the risk of unnecessary tension \u2013 or worse. 32 should it also need to be said: this issue highlights the astonishingly obdurate levels to which these parents \u2013 at times \u2013 will descend in their contests. unless they work out some much better co-parenting options, it is going to continue to absorb, if not ultimately consume and exhaust, ever more of their financial, and all other, resources. issue iii: \u201cfirst-option care\u201d 33 in relation to the \u201cfirst option to care\u201d order, the mother seeks such an order be made. she addressed the fact that historically there have been periods of time where the father has travelled for work and the mother did not want an instance to arise where the child was spending substantial periods away from both parents, while the other is available. the father submitted that such an order was inappropriate and a matter for the parents to sort out between themselves, rather than needing the intervention of the court. 34 there is more than a touch of irony (other words are also apposite) where one parent submits to the court that the parties can and should work out the particular issue at hand, but they have, thus far, not been able to resolve it \u2013 hence the court\u2019s continued involvement! 35 given how the parties have something of a history of not sorting things out from time to time, i see no major issue if there is a first care option order as proposed by the mother, save that only if the father happens to be unavailable for more than 3 days will such an order operate. this is also to acknowledge that the father\u2019s wife, who is well-known to x and has a good and close relationship with her (which historically may lurk somewhere, subterraneanly, behind some of the adult angst along the way), is more than capable of looking after the child in the father\u2019s absence. i note in this regard that the father advised the court during the hearing that he does not now travel regularly as he once did and now essentially remains in the act precisely to be available to spend time with his daughter. 36 again, one would hope that common sense would prevail and something akin to a middle-east peace negotiation would not be necessary to accommodate and resolve situations, however unlikely, that might arise in this regard. 37 regarding any other issues that may arise in the future (one hopes earnestly not \u2013 for everyone\u2019s sake), as a notation only, the parties are to go to mediation before attempting to bring the matter back to the court. everyone, most especially x, needs a rest and to be able to get on with her life (and likewise her parents to get on with theirs) free from the third-wheel of the court. to mix metaphors: the unrelenting and often financially and emotionally destructive litigation chariot needs to be put away and the dust and din of the battle allowed to settle. 38 one final observation is apposite. over the course of her young life, x/x has shown that she will pretty much thrive whatever the arrangements her parents set up for her. therefore, in almost all respects, particularly given how much was finally agreed between the parents at trial, and given that few orders are in fact \u201cperfect\u201d, the orders sought by either parent in relation to the discrete issues outstanding will more likely than not be suitable and appropriate. it follows similarly that orders that approximate one or other set of orders sought, or some combination of them, will likewise be satisfactory and meet the \u201cbest interests\u201d requirement under the act. as already stated, the real issue is not so much what is best for the child and what the court determines in this regard because history shows that she will sail on regardless of the grandness or pettiness of the disputes between her parents. rather, the real issue remains \u201cthe parents.\u201d there is no \u201cbest practice\u201d there. it is for them to work out how to co-parent better, and without dragging each other back to court. time alone will tell whether they will continue to expend all manner of their resources on lawyers rather than on their beloved daughter. associate: dated: 10 december 2021 annexure a excerpt from family report by counsellor ms e evaluation 69. this assessment considers the future living and time-spending arrangements for x, aged 3 years and 10 months. since x\u2019s parents ceased cohabiting in july 2018, when she was approximately 12 months old, somewhat unusually for a child of her age, she has lived in an equal shared care parenting arrangement. this type of arrangement is uncommon for such a young child, because most children by the age of about 9 months, have formed clear attachments, and thereafter may experience separation anxiety from their primary carer. whilst a child can have more than one attachment figure, it is likely that those attachments will be hierarchical. 70. the mother claimed that she has been x\u2019s primary carer since birth. the father disagreed with the mother\u2019s assertion, and he claimed that the parents were equally x\u2019s primary carer. this is despite the father seemingly acknowledging that x spent substantially more time with the mother in x\u2019s early months of life, including whilst he was away from the family home on at least two separate occasions for two weeks, in the first six months of x\u2019s life. given the father\u2019s admissions about the time he spent away from x when she was a young baby, it appears that x may have formed a primary attachment to her mother as a baby. in these circumstances it is questionable whether the decision for x to live in an equal shared care arrangement after the parents had separated was an ideal arrangement. furthermore, equal shared care parenting arrangements are normally best suited to family situations where there is no conflict in the child\u2019s presence, and no conflict communicated to the child in any way. the narratives that both the mother and the father provided suggest that x witnessed conflict between the parents when they were a couple, and post-separation. 71. if it is accepted that the mother was x\u2019s primary carer at the point when the parents ceased cohabiting, the post-separation parenting arrangements may have placed x at risk of suffering repetitive stress by being separated from her mother. if an infant, is difficult to settle, clingy or withdrawn for extended periods, in either parent\u2019s home, this is could suggest that the child is excessively stressed. recurring stress can reduce a child\u2019s resilience, and result in regression, it can also disrupt a child\u2019s ability to form a secure attachment with each parent. disruptions in a child\u2019s primary attachment may have adverse outcomes for a child across their lifespan, such as a child developing mental health issues. it is concerning that, the mother alleged that the father bullied her into agreeing to an equal shared care arrangement, and stated that x has never coped with it. if the mother\u2019s report that the father forced her into an equal shared care arrangement is accurate, this seems to suggest that he may have failed to prioritise x\u2019s needs. nonetheless, the father denied the mother\u2019s allegations, and asserted that an equal shared care arrangement has worked well for x. during this assessment, there was no overt information to suggest that x had been harmed by the post-separation parenting arrangements. if the court were to find no current evidence that x has been psychologically harmed by the post-separation parenting arrangements, it does not mean such harm will not manifest itself as x matures, perhaps in problematic relationships with her peers, or in the development of mental health issues (e.g. depression and anxiety). it is noted that around x\u2019s age (nearly 4 years old), children often become less anxious about separations from their primary caregiver(s), and consequently, this may have been a factor in the smooth transitions that the author witnessed between x and her parents. 72. the current parenting arrangements, whereby x spends equal time with her parents arguably provides x with the opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with each of her parents. however, this arrangement also seems, on occasions to expose her to parental conflict, which, if it persists, could magnify the problems the mother reported with regard to x\u2019s clingy behaviour. 73. the mother\u2019s allegations of family violence by the father seem to indicate a pattern of power and control, and her narratives were consistent with a survivor of family violence. although the mother advised that the father has not allegedly abused her since litigation commenced (in november 2019), it is concerning that she reported continuing to fear that he will psychologically abuse her, as this could impair her ability to focus on x\u2019s needs. notwithstanding, the father mostly denied the mother\u2019s allegations, therefore, this will be a matter for evidence. the father alleged psychological abuse and threatening behaviour by the mother, nevertheless, he said that her alleged behaviour did not cause him to feel unsafe. it is concerning that the father alleged that, there have been about six occasions, when the mother has been aggressive towards him since the parties\u2019 separated, with the most recent occasion being in march 2021, when she allegedly yelled at him and pushed him. the mother made some limited admissions of occasional aggression towards the father. 74. clearly, it seems that x, during her infancy, when she most needed safe and warm parenting, may not have been adequately protected from parental dispute. the experiences that x has had of the parenting dynamic may shape her capacity to enjoy safe and secure relationships throughout her lifespan. the mother\u2019s admissions of occasional hostility seem to indicate that, at times, she may have struggled to control strong emotions. if either parent is unable to contain their emotions, x could be at risk of witnessing, or being subjected to aggression whilst in each parties\u2019 care. as a result, x learn to believe that aggression is an acceptable response. 75. the father alleged that the mother has exposed x to the parental dispute. the father also alleged that, historically, the mother clung onto x at changeover and this caused x distress. the mother denied the father\u2019s allegations. if the father\u2019s allegations are correct, the mother\u2019s behaviour may have caused x confusion, and exacerbated the security issues, which the mother reported that x\u2019s experiences. 76. the father\u2019s admission that he introduced the step-mother to x, only a couple of months after the parents ceased cohabiting is concerning, as it appears insensitive to x\u2019s needs. this is particularly because, at the time x was only about 14 months old, and having to deal with the potential anxiety of frequent separations from the mother, exposure to the parental conflict, whilst also trying to meet critical infancy milestones (e.g. learning to walk and talk). furthermore, the father\u2019s actions seemed to have fuelled the conflict between the parents. 77. the father denied the mother\u2019s allegation that there are times when he consumes alcohol to excess, and asserted that he has never consumed alcohol above the legal limit to drive when x has been in his care. despite this, given x\u2019s young age, it is suggested that each party is restrained from consuming alcohol above the legal limit to drive when x is in their care. 78. the mother reported that, after x\u2019s birth she had post-natal anxiety. the mother denied the father\u2019s allegation that she has anger issues, however, she said that she accesses counselling due to the father\u2019s alleged psychological abuse of her. it appears that the mother feels affronted by the father\u2019s engagement in a relationship with the step-mother soon after the parents separated, and as such she is likely to benefit from ongoing counselling, to help manage these emotions. the observation of the mother with x, indicates that there might be times when she seeks reassurance from x regarding her efficacy, and it is possible that x may find the mother\u2019s behaviour intrusive. however, if the mother\u2019s allegation is correct, that the father has bullied her, her self-esteem may have been negatively effected, and she might need assistance rebuild a sense of self-worth. it is suggested that, if this is the case, then the mother works on this issue with her counsellor. 79. the father denied the mother\u2019s allegation that he has ptsd, and, at interview, there was no overt information to suggest that he has an acute mental health problem, therefore, this will be a matter for evidence. the step-mother confirmed that she has anxiety, but indicated that her mental health is stable. the step-mother\u2019s description of the mental health issues that she has experienced in the past, suggests that, if those issues were to arise again in the future, then she may struggle to meet x\u2019s needs. 80. the mother described the parents as having a limited effective co-parenting relationship, and presented as frustrated with the father\u2019s allegedly bullying and dishonest behaviour towards her. the father\u2019s decision to take x to brisbane in january 2020, without the mother\u2019s consent, was not conducive to supporting a trusting relationship between the parents. while the father claimed that the parents generally have an effective co-parenting relationship, his narratives did not entirely support this assertion. one example of this is his allegation that the mother has, on about six occasions, been aggressive towards him at changeover, another is his allegation that she has threatened to incur him additional legal fees. it seems that the parents may each benefit from participating in a post-separation parenting course, to help improve their co-parenting relationship. 81. the mother\u2019s proposal that x lives primarily with her, seems founded on her desire to provide x with stable living arrangements and the opportunity to recover from the alleged stress the equal shared care arrangement has caused x. the main advantage of this proposal appears to be that it may reduce x\u2019s exposure to the conflict between the parents and reduce the frequency of transitions between the parents\u2019 homes. a major drawback of this proposal is that x may feel a sense of loss, if her time with the father is reduced, since she has been living in an equal shared care parenting arrangement for almost three years. 82. the father\u2019s proposal that x continues living in an equal shared care arrangement, seems to be based on his assertion that it is generally working well for x. the chief benefit of this proposal appears to be that it would provide stability of the amount of time x spends with each parent, and it may allow x to consolidate and strengthen her relationship with each of her parents. a disadvantage of this proposal is that equal shared parenting arrangements generally provide the best outcomes for children when both parents agree to such an arrangement, and there is an effective co-parenting relationship. this does not seem to be the case in this matter. 83. a key concern in this case appears to be that x has witnessed conflict, and possibly violence between her parents since she was a baby, yet despite this, arrangements were made for her to live in an equal share care arrangement after her parents ceased cohabiting. the conflict that x witnessed may have made it a challenge for her to form a secure attachment with each parent. meanwhile, the frequent separations from her parents may have been confusing and stressful for x. notwithstanding, currently there does not appear to be any independent information to indicate that x has been harmed by these apparently sub-optimal parenting arrangements. however, it is suggested that each parent is likely to benefit from participating in the \u2018circle of security\u2019 parenting course to assist strengthening their parenting skills. 84. if the father\u2019s assertion is correct, that x has coped well with the seemingly sub-optimal shared care parenting arrangement, there could be various reasons why this is the case. those reasons could include, x being securely attached to both parents when the parties\u2019 ceased cohabiting, and/or that she is an innately resilient child, consequently these factors may have acted as a buffer against her potentially stressful situation. alternatively, there might also be other unidentified reasons as to why x has coped with the post-separation parenting arrangements. 85. if the court is satisfied that the current equal shared care arrangement is not causing x significant emotional stress, it is considered to be in her best interests to live in the \u201c2/2/3/2/2/3\u201d fortnightly cycle that the father proposes. this is because it seems to provide a more consistent routine than the three night about arrangement, particularly with regard to allowing x to alternate between spending weekends with each parent. another advantage is that it will allow most changeovers to occur at childcare, and therefore reduce the likelihood of x being exposed to the parental dispute. it is suggested that, upon x starting full-time formal education (in 2023), and providing no major issues have arisen with regard to her living in an equal shared care arrangement, that during the school holidays, she transitions to living in a week about arrangement with her parents. it is suggested that upon x commencing year 1 at school (in 2024), providing no significant issues have arisen with regard to the parenting arrangements, that she transitions to living in a week about arrangement with her parents. it is suggested that, upon x commencing year 2 at school (in 2025), providing no substantial issues have arisen, each parent be at liberty to spend a block of two weeks with x during the term 4 school holidays. it is suggested that while x spends time with her parents under the \u201c2/2/3/2/2/3\u201d arrangement, x continues to have video communication with the parent with whom she is not living each saturday. upon x commencing spending blocks of one week or more with each of her parents, it is suggested that she has video communication with the parent with whom she does not reside twice a week. 86. the father proposed that, upon x turning 10 years old, each party be at liberty to travel overseas with her. the mother stated that she is unsure whether she agrees to the father\u2019s proposal. given that x is only 3 years old, it is difficult to know whether the father\u2019s proposal is in her best interests, as much will depend on x\u2019s capacity to continue enjoying a positive relationship with each of her parents. however, it is noted that overseas travel can have benefits for children, such as giving them the opportunity to experience different cultures. in these circumstances, it is beyond the scope of this assessment to make a recommendation regarding international travel. annexure b applicant\u2019s outline of case document filed 15th october 2021 parental responsibility 1. the parents each seek equally shared parental responsibility. 2. this matter is relatively straightforward. the court is faced with two good parents each with a good relationships with the child. they have fundamentally different views of what time arrangment best meets her best interest. best interests \u2013 primary considerations meaningful relationship (section 60cc(2)(a) of the family law act) 1. the mother\u2019s orders sought provide for the child maintaining a meaningful relationship with her father. 2. the father seeks to continue the equal time arrangement. 3. the mother contends that a continuation of equal time presents significant risks to the child\u2019s develepment, including long term risks to the child\u2019s future mental health. 4. the family consultant notes that the court may find no current evidence of psychological harm, but that does not mean that such harm will not manifest [71]. 5. the family consultant also notes that equal time arrangements work best when the parents agree and have an effective co-parenting relationship, something she did not find existed here [82]. 6. notwithstanding the mother has been raising her observations of a detrimental impact on the child of equal time since shortly after the arrangement commenced, those concerns have been wholly dismissed by the father leading to the current court proceedings. 7. the mother contends that the father\u2019s dismissive attitude towards her is an ongoing risk to the child in an equal time arrangement. 8. the family consultant\u2019s recommendation for a continuation of equal time is qualified by two things [a]: the court is satisfied the current arrangement is not causing the child significant emotional distress, and [b] there being no major issues arising from the equal time arrangement for the child [85]. 9. effectively, this is an experimental recommendation. if issues were to arise, the history of this matter indicates no agreement is likely to be reached without further litigation. the need to protect the child from harm (section 60cc(2)(b) of the family law act) 10. the mother asserts a history of coercion and control by the father. the father denies this. 11. the mother contends that the father\u2019s complete disregard for her reasonable and rational concerns as to the equal time arrangement over a period of years is a manifestation of his negative attitude towards her. 12. the father\u2019s unilateral actions in relation to the child in spite of any conversation, concern or agreement reached with the mother provide a clear picture of that attitude. 13. a continuation of equal time further invalidates the mother\u2019s experience of the arrangement with a likely negative impact on her. 14. the impact of upon the mother can have a flow on effect to the child. 15. on either partes\u2019 evidence, the child is exposed to conflict between her parents, particularly at handovers. as is clear in the report, that conflict has a greater impact on the mother than on the father. best interests \u2013 additional considerations 1. few of the s60cc(3) factors will be relevant to the court\u2019s determination of this finely balanced matter. 2. the mother contends that consideration of the evidence with reference to subsections (c)(f)(i)(j) and (l) lead to the court making orders as sought by her. annexure c respondent\u2019s outline of case filed 15th october 2021 parental responsibility 1. the allocation of parental responsibility relates only to major, long-term decisions affecting x. there is evidence from both parties about the parties' respectful and productive communications in relation to these issues, despite the other difficulties between them. 2. the presumption as to equal shared parental responsibility in s61da ought to be applied and is not rebutted by any evidence that it would not be in x\u2019s best interests. the exceptions to the presumption do not apply and therefore an order for equal shared parental responsibility should be made. best interests \u2013 primary considerations meaningful relationship (section 60cc(2)(a) of the family law act) 3. if the orders sought by the father are made, x will have a meaningful relationship between both parents, as is observed by ms e in her report in saying that \u201cthe current parenting arrangements, whereby x spends equal time with her parents, arguably provides x with the opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with each of her parents\u201d. the need to protect the child from harm (section 60cc(2)(b) of the family law act) 4. neither party seems to suggest that the other suffers from any serious parental incapacity, or that the need to protect x from harm is a relevant consideration. accordingly, the court\u2019s primary consideration should be the benefit to x of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. best interests \u2013 additional considerations (a) views of the child 1. both parties depose to having a close relationship with x, and to x expressing her love and affection for the other parent. notwithstanding that, the court\u2019s ability to consider x\u2019s views is limited by her age. (b) relationship with the child\u2019s parents and other persons 2. the father gives extensive evidence about his relationship with x. it is submitted that it is one that x derives benefit from and that it is meaningful. it extends to the mundane daily tasks of preparing meals, brushing teeth, and night time routines (f35), and to meaningful life moments, such as conversations about x\u2019s emotions and educational development (f39). 3. the father\u2019s evidence is that x\u2019s relationship with her stepmother and stepmother\u2019s family (f44) being positive and well-established. the step-mother has resided with x and the father since july 2019, when x was aged 2. there is no plausible challenge to that evidence by the mother. similarly, the step-mother has family in the canberra and suburb f area who have developed a familial relationship with x (m20). 4. the father\u2019s position is that the mother is not willing or able to facilitate x\u2019s relationship with her step-mother. (c) opportunities taken in relation to x\u2019s parenting 5. the father\u2019s evidence is that both parents have remained significantly and equally involved in x\u2019s care since separation. 6. the likely effect of the changes sought to be put in place by the orders of the mother is to significantly disrupt her relationship with both her father and step-mother. x is significantly accustomed to the current arrangement, it having been in place since shortly after separation. it is clear on the father\u2019s evidence that such a significant lessening of the time she spends with the father shall be detrimental to x. such finding is supported by ms e, at paragraph 81 of her report, \u201ca major drawback of the proposal is that x may feel a sense of loss, if her time with the father is reduced, since she has been living in an equal shared care parenting arrangement for almost three years\u201d. 7. conversely, the father\u2019s proposal is not a significant change in x\u2019s circumstances. x has not yet started school and has maintained a consistent living arrangement for almost 3 years. the father\u2019s proposal also brings two attractive benefits: the \u20182/2/3/2/2/3\u2019 fortnightly cycle would limit the number of changeovers between the parties that occur at the parties\u2019 homes, so too would the week-about arrangement that the father proposed from the time x begins year 1 at school. x would have greater consistency of routine, in that the changeover days would be fixed on a fortnightly basis. (e) practicability 8. the relevant locations in the case seem to be the mother\u2019s home, the father\u2019s home, and x\u2019s day-care. those places are all close by to one another in suburb f, nsw. the father has some flexibility around his work and support from ms c (f78). the father\u2019s proposal is therefore practicable. 9. while communication between the parties has at times been fraught, the father deposes to the acrimony between them being sporadic. he points to various examples where the parties have been able to communicate in good humour and in such a way that facilitates decisions being made in a productive way about x\u2019s wellbeing (f50). (f) capacity 10. there is nothing to suggest that the capacity of either parent mitigates against an equal time arrangement. implicit in each party\u2019s proposal is an acceptance that the other is capable of looking after x. any suggestion by the mother that restricting the father\u2019s time would allow x to better meet her developmental needs is not corroborated. (g-k) not relevant (l) lest likely to lead to institution of further proceedings 11. both parties have demonstrated a willingness to comply with the orders of this court, and the father\u2019s proposal marks no significant change to those orders. 12. the only substantial issue that the parties have required court intervention to resolve is that of the living arrangements for x. [1] oral reasons regarding three discrete issues were delivered on 5th november 2021. regrettably, the father was unable to be present when the reasons were delivered. his solicitor assured the court that he would be apprised of them. had he been present it may be the case that the parties will have saved themselves further expense and other things. what follows is those reasons revised from the transcript. the revision of them for possible future publication was advised to them at the time of delivery. it does, however, somewhat beg the question: why try to get reasons out as early as possible so that parties can get on with their lives but then one or both of them do not turn up (or are unable to do so) to hear the reasons \u2013 unless there is perhaps an ulterior motive (which i do not suggest here) for one party to use subsequent procedures to bring pressure to bear on the other party to secure what is perceived as a more favourable outcome.[2] cdj v vaj (1998) 197 clr 172.[3] again for ease of reference, annexed to these reasons is the evaluation section of ms e\u2019s report, dated 17th august 2021, exhibit a.[4] see the full court\u2019s decision (aldridge j) in tanberg & remmy [2021] famcafc 49.", "metadata": {"filename": "113.txt", "size": 60123, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 60665, "document_id": "113"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "113_chunk_0"}}

at the commencement of the final hearing listed in this matter, the applicant made an application for adjournment or other relief in response to late and inadequate financial disclosure by the first respondent. your honour ordered that the property matter was to be run on a \u2018show cause\u2019 basis. your honour referred to the full court\u2019s decision in chang v su [2002] famca 156, flc 93\u2013117. it is submitted that the relevant principles of that case, and the line of cases which follow it, that are applicable to this matter are: in circumstances where there has not been full and frank disclosure of financial circumstances by a party, it is open to a court to find that an indeterminate undisclosed amount is held by one of the parties and to make property orders without reference to an overall pool on the basis of the \u2018just and equitable\u2019 imperative: chang v su at [71]-[72]. a judge is entitled to take a robust view in relation to findings regarding a party\u2019s financial position, including a party\u2019s capacity to meet any proposed order, where that party has failed to make full and frank disclosure of their financial position: chang v su at [72] and graf-salzmann & graf [2015] fcwa 68 at [287] per walters j. while a deliberate and blatant pattern of conduct in not complying with disclosure obligations would make the court\u2019s task more difficult, it also entitles the court to more easily draw inferences that such evidence would not.have assisted the defaulting party\u2019s case: chang v su at [70], approving weir v weir [1992] famca 69, (1993) flc 92-338, 16 fam lr 154 at 79,593. where the non-disclosure has been deliberate, the court should not be \u2018unduly cautious\u2019 about making findings in favour of the innocent party: chang v su at [70]. in circumstances where a party has improperly failed to fully disclose their financial affairs, property settlement orders may make more generous provision for the other party: kingston & field (no 2) [2020] famcafc 235 at 106. coleman j further clarified in the case of sand and sand [2012] famcafc 179, flc 93\u2013519 that it would be incorrect to create a pool of assets which included notional assets and add-backs and then proceed to distribute that pool where the property did not in fact exist. in light of the above, the applicant understands and submits that: in determining these proceedings the court will take a robust view in relation to the evidence and potential findings, and will not be unduly cautions about making findings in favour of the applicant, and it will be a matter for the first respondent to evidence his contributions and explain his withdrawals from the joint property pool which the applicant says was available and/or wasted by the first respondent, and makes the submissions that follow accordingly. lack of disclosure there are long-standing authorities regarding the duty of complete and ongoing financial disclosure in family matters: see black & kellner [1992] famca 2, (1992) 15 fam lr 343, among others. the case law supplements rules of court such as rules 6.01 and 6.06 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021. the duty to disclose is absolute: weir & weir [1992] famca 69, (1993) flc 92-338 at 79,593, chang v su [2002] famca 156, (2002) flc 93-117 at [70]. such principles apply whether the omissions of disclosure were negligent and/or unintentional, or were wilful and/or deliberate: see for example leclair & abel [2018] fcca 2068 at [46(b)] per neville j. the applicant submits that the first respondent has failed to provide appropriate financial disclosure throughout these proceedings. it is further submitted that these failures were intentional, made after consideration, and the product of specific decisions to withhold information notwithstanding the absolute duty of disclosure. the applicant relies upon the lengthy history of requests for disclosure as evidenced in its tender bundle, as well as specific admissions by the first respondent in his oral evidence at transcript p35 l45-46, p36 l5-7, p38 l16 and l37-38. loans from the applicant\u2019s parents insofar as the first respondent might maintain its disclosure argument and objection to the admission into evidence of the statutory declarations of the applicant\u2019s parents at pages 20 to 23 of the applicant\u2019s tender bundle, these documents have been removed from the agreed tender bundle. however, these documents are still relied upon by the applicant to prove the existence of these loans and their admission into evidence is sought. insofar as it might be argued that the documents should not be admitted into evidence because of a failure by the applicant to disclose the material, or to put the documents to the first respondent in cross-examination, the applicant submits: the matter was being run on a \u2018show cause\u2019 basis with respect to the first respondent, as your honour noted on day 2 (see transcript p6 line 5), the documents speak for themselves, the existence and content of the documents was known to the first respondent, given the applicant\u2019s evidence was that the documents were prepared to evidence the loans for centrelink purposes and were so lodged by the first respondent, (see transcript p71 l1-p72 l8), corroborated by the statutory declarations similarly prepared for and lodged by the first respondent in respect of the loans from his family (see transcript p49 l11-17), the first respondent made unambiguous denials in cross-examination about the fact of the loans (see for example transcript p43 line 28-44 & p46 line 8-17), and (at transcript 43 line 36-38) invited the applicant to produce any documentation she had about the loans, which was promptly done, the applicant\u2019s proposed tender bundle including these documents was sent to representatives for the first respondent prior to the start of court on day 3 of the hearing (5 april), and they could have: sought a short break after cross-examination of the first respondent completed that morning and sought instructions on the documents, at a time where the interpreter was still available, and/or raised any objections to the intended tender in open court at the time of the hearing, but they did not. the property pool as was effectively conceded by his counsel during hearing, there are parts of the first respondent\u2019s financial statement which do not correctly reflect his circumstances \u2013 for example, the document does not indicate that the first respondent pays rent for his current accommodation when he does: see for example transcript p77 l18-20. further, the first respondent\u2019s position appears to be that while he was on multiple occasions in receipt of considerable money \u2013 such as when he obtained the mortgage over the matrimonial property at 61 town d st \u2013 that money has been entirely dissipated by, among other things: a. repayment of family loans, b. costs of renovations to the matrimonial home, and c. ordinary living expenses. the first respondent has led no evidence on affidavit from his family members or partner in support of the assertions he makes as to financial matters. further, he has led no detailed evidence as to the supposed renovations nor living expenses such that your honour can be satisfied that moneys were indeed expended on such items. the applicant suggests that jones v dunkel inferences are available and submits they should be made in respect of these matters. the applicant has collated in an annexure to these submissions the evidence going to both parties\u2019 assets and liabilities. from this the applicant submits that the court should infer that there may have been a property pool available in these proceedings at a minimum of $403k, and possibly as high as $539k. the annexure causes the applicant\u2019s submissions to exceed the page limit for this document, and accordingly the applicant formally and respectfully seeks leave for this document to exceed the specified page limit on the basis that: counsel for the first respondent was advised of the above in advance of filing and indicated she would not object to the submissions on this basis, the applicant would have included the information contained in the annexure in her financial statement to be filed prior to the commencement of the hearing had proper pre-trial disclosure been made by the first respondent, and the annexure includes information which was disclosed only for the first time in the applicant\u2019s oral evidence at hearing. it is the applicant\u2019s submission that: the first respondent\u2019s supposed family loans were sham arrangements, the renovations supposedly undertaken on the matrimonial home do not support the amounts allegedly spent on that work, and the amounts of money which otherwise appears to have been dissipated or wasted does not support a conclusion that the money was properly used on ordinarily living expenses. the first respondent suggests that an amount of $130k was expended on renovations: applicant\u2019s tender bundle, p60, first respondent\u2019s oral evidence at transcript p58 l20-34. however, the amounts listed as being expended to that purpose in the first respondent\u2019s trial affidavit at [162]-[168] only add up to $90k. while the applicant accepts that some renovations were undertaken by the first respondent, the applicant relies upon the valuation of the property post-separation by ms egerton (at applicant\u2019s tender bundle, p19) as to the true state of the property and submits that on no fair estimate can the work said to have been completed equate to a value of $90k, let alone $130k. this is supported by the first respondent\u2019s annexure n to his trial affidavit and page 3 of the f bank bank statement which indicates that $12.5k worth of repairs and maintenance had to be made to the property in january 2023 before it could be sold, as well as the applicant\u2019s trial affidavit at [58] and annexure s setting out and depicting the condition of the property before her departure. the evidence is clear that the supposed family loans in the statutory declarations in january 2018 were in the first instance sham arrangements intended to present a misleading picture to centrelink: see the first respondent\u2019s evidence at transcript p49 l11-17, as well as the documents\u2019 inconsistencies and lack of veracity. the first respondent\u2019s evidence in relation to the statutory declarations purportedly evidencing the loans (annexure t of the applicant\u2019s trial affidavit) contradicts the material put forward by the first respondent in his trial affidavit and his annexures (specifically annexure r). in that what the statutory declarations purport to formalise and evidence: the first respondent\u2019s supposed family loans were sham arrangements, the renovations supposedly undertaken on the matrimonial home do not support the amounts allegedly spent on that work, and the amounts of money which otherwise appears to have been dissipated or wasted does not support a conclusion that the money was properly used on ordinarily living expenses. further, the applicant notes that there were other family loans made at or before the making of the declarations which could have been included or referenced in the documents and which are not (such as two separate loans of $15,000 allegedly from the first respondent\u2019s father, one to buy a work vehicle and another to fund renovations, one of which allegedly still remains outstanding). in submitting that the supposed family loans and/or repayments of these loans were sham arrangements intended to defeat the applicant\u2019s claim, or at least reckless to this being a potential outcome, the applicant relies upon the following: her uncontroverted evidence that this is precisely what the first respondent\u2019s brother mr e said (at transcript p76 l44-47), both properties were purchased post-marriage and therefore could reasonably have been expected to be split between the parties upon separation, the alleged loans to purchase the properties and for other purposes were made on long-term bases and there were no impending or crystallised deadlines for repayment \u2013 see [59] and annexure t of the applicant\u2019s trial affidavit, the mortgage over 61 town d st was settled after the separation of the parties, save for one small loan (referred to in the first respondent\u2019s trial affidavit at [151a]) the family loans were repaid after the separation of the parties, the transfer of the toyota landcruiser to the first respondent\u2019s father, supposedly to repay a loan, was also done immediately after the separation of the parties, and the first respondent\u2019s evidence was somewhat contradictory about whether the amounts of money mr e gives him post-separation were gifts or loans to be repaid, but it seems fairly clear that the sums of money being given post separation are not being recorded and there is no expectation by mr e of payment\u2013 see generally transcript p64 \u2013 thus supporting an inference that the first respondent has \u2018banked\u2019 funds with his family outside of the immediate reach of this court and draws down on them as he needs. that the first respondent has access to more money that he otherwise suggests is evident from the previous offers he gave evidence about putting to the applicant post-separation for maintenance and property settlement, including but not limited to his statements at transcript p17 l36, p23 l21-23, p24 l21-43, p25 l1-3 and l12-14. the first respondent\u2019s work further, the applicant submits that your honour will find, notwithstanding the first respondent\u2019s denials (see for example his trial affidavit at [11]), that the first respondent has engaged in paid employment post-separation, and he continues to earn income from employment, as a tiler from time to time, even if the extent of the work done or income earned is unclear. the applicant relies upon the following evidence in support of the proposition that the first respondent has worked post-separation and continues to work: the first respondent completed his financial statement for the court in which he stated that he was self-employed for alextyle, the first respondent completed his financial statement for the court in which he said that he had $10k of tools and building material on hand\u2013 the applicant submits that these are supplies for future jobs, and such a significant amount of tools and materials being on hand is inconsistent with his alleged cessation of work in march 2019 (see [39] of the first respondent\u2019s trial affidavit), the first respondent renewed his licence as a wall and floor tiler, issued in his personal name and to his address, on 7 june 2022 for a further period of 3 years: see [54] and annexure o of the applicant\u2019s trial affidavit, the first respondent complains in his trial affidavit at [166] of post-separation not being able to access his tools and materials at the matrimonial home \u201cwhich i mean i have not been able to work\u201d, but the separation occurred in april 2019 after the alleged cessation of work in march 2019 (compare [39] of the first respondent\u2019s trial affidavit), the first respondent further suggests in his trial affidavit at [168] that his application to f bank bank for financial hardship relief in respect of the mortgage was also founded in part due to lack of access to his tools and materials, which is suggestive of his use of those in employment, the hipages printouts (applicant\u2019s tender bundle p1-7) show a constant pattern of reviews for completed work throughout the period that the first respondent was allegedly unable to work \u2013 the applicant submits that it would be complete nonsense that people are leaving reviews for the first respondent this month for work he did before he was injured in march 2019. the first respondent\u2019s responses under cross-examination were unconvincing and inconsistent. his evidence changed over time to suit the evidence that was put to him: he said initially that he was unemployed (transcript p10 l25-29) and that he didn\u2019t have a business (transcript p31 l28). then when shown his financial statement and his admission of self-employment his evidence was \u201ci do have a business, but i\u2019m not working with it and not using it. sorry. again. it\u2019s ongoing, but i\u2019m not working with it.\u201d (at transcript p32 l39-41).\\ then after being shown the hipages document (applicant\u2019s tender bundle tender bundle p1-7) his evidence was \u201cthis business now for my cousin. my cousin doesn\u2019t have a licence, and that\u2019s why he\u2019s running his business under my licence, and he\u2019s using my business to work.\u201d (at transcript p33 l13-15). then after being asked why the hipages referred to \u2018alex\u2019 in the context of his cousin\u2019s name being abdul, his evidence was \u201che\u2019s using my name because the business name alex tile (sic).\u201d (transcript p33 l30). it is submitted, with respect, that the first respondent\u2019s answers are inherently incredible and the product of invention in the witness box to suit the evidence put before him. it is noted that there is no evidence on affidavit from the first respondent to the effect that his business continues on without him working in it. proposed order 1 \u2013 lump sum payment of $300,000 the amended response filed by the first respondent on 15 march 2023 puts forward only a proposal in respect of property which is predicated upon the matrimonial property being available in the proceedings \u2013 which it is not any longer. the first respondent would have agreed to a 60:40 split of the property pool but says the property pool is negligible. otherwise the first respondent puts forward no formal position as to how he will provide for his children or the applicant. it is submitted that the applicant is in need of maintenance and/or a significant property settlement by virtue of her own personal circumstances and having the care and control of minor children of the marriage. in light of the case law outlined above, and having regard to the annexure and the submissions above, the applicant submits that there is an indeterminate and undisclosed amount of money, but certainly some hundreds of thousands of dollars, which is held by the first respondent\u2019s family effectively on trust for him and which the first respondent \u2018draws down on\u2019 as he needs. it is on that basis that the applicant seeks a lump sum payment having regard to the previously known asset pool and lack of good explanation for its dissipation. in terms of the s 75(2) and s 79(4) factors, the applicant submits: prior to the marriage, the applicant was part way through a degree course in country b, which she ceased due to the first respondent\u2019s promises that she would be able to complete after the marriage and when in australia \u2013 this promise was never kept. during the marriage the first respondent worked and received an income from employment. during the marriage the applicant stayed at home caring for the children of the marriage and maintaining as best she could the matrimonial home. she did not undertake any paid employment. throughout the marriage the first respondent exercised control over the applicant\u2019s daily living. even the money the applicant received from centrelink was taken by the first respondent, through use of an app and possession of the applicant\u2019s bank card. (many of the offers of settlement put forward by the first respondent, such as his living in the garage, are properly characterized as efforts to regain and maintain control over the applicant.) both parties have from time to time received loans and gifts of money from their families. while the first respondent has allegedly paid back the majority of the money owing to his family members, the money lent by the applicant\u2019s parents remains outstanding. this money was likely used by the first respondent as seed money to support the purchase of property. the applicant and the children reside in young because this is where the first respondent moved the family to from sydney. the reason the first respondent gave for the move was to align with his family supports and employment prospects. while the first respondent indicated an intention to renovate the matrimonial home, and some renovation did occur, actually by the point of separation the matrimonial home was significantly damaged and in need of repair. to the extent that the first respondent alleges that property and other expenses were paid for out of savings, the first respondent was only able to make those savings by virtue of the applicant\u2019s care of the children and maintenance of the home. post-separation the first respondent has moved back to sydney and the applicant has no family or other supports in young. in leaving the formal matrimonial home and failing to pay the mortgage such that the property was repossessed, the first respondent's actions has directly led to the homelessness of his children. the first respondent also took steps to repossess the family car (the toyota landcruiser) post-separation. the applicant initially had to obtain interim orders to regain use of the vehicle, and once that car stopped working, she had to go into personal debt and utilise personal savings to obtain a vehicle to assist in the children\u2019s activities and schooling. at present, the first respondent refuses to meaningfully financially support his children. it is accepted that the first respondent did suffer an injury in april 2019 which caused him to have difficulty working for a period of time. however, as per above, it is submitted that the first respondent has worked post-separation and continues to engage in paid employment, the extent of which is unknown and unascertainable by virtue of the first respondent\u2019s disclosure failings. the applicant does not presently work and has no qualifications which might lead her to obtain meaningful work in the future. the applicant\u2019s future employment prospects in young in her field are minimal. the applicant and children presently reside in crisis accommodation in young. the applicant would like in future to relocate back to sydney to align with her extended family and friend support network, but such a course is impossible at present given the first respondent's refusal to meaningfully financially support his children. for all of the above reasons, the applicant submits that: her contributions during the marriage, while not always directly financial (although the first respondent did directly access her centrelink payments), were such that it would have been appropriate to commence at an equal distribution of property, leaving aside issues of non-disclosure, on a pure assessment of contributions and the statutory factors outlined above, in terms of splitting of a fulsome property pool the applicant would have sought adjustments of: at least an additional 10% for post separation factors, and at least an additional 10% for statutory factors, however, the making of a property order in the conventional way is not possible in this case given the first respondent\u2019s conduct and the court\u2019s inability to identify a determinate property pool, and the making of the order for a lump sum payment in the amount of $300,000 is, in all the circumstances of this case, just and equitable, particularly in light of the first respondent\u2019s very significant and deliberate non-disclosure in these proceedings. the applicant notes that the making of an order in this amount would represent, having regard to the annexure and depending on the figures used, an allocation to the applicant of between 55% and 74% of the apparent property pool. given the first respondent\u2019s apparent impecuniosity and the circumstances listed above, while a regular maintenance payment might well be more beneficial for the applicant, the applicant considers that a lump sum payment might well be more convenient for the first respondent. further, a lump sum payment would remove any risk of a future cessation of support by the first respondent, as well as removing a potential source of ongoing conflict for the parties or coercive control. proposed order 2 \u2013 restraint on the first respondent leaving australia the full court acknowledged in the case of brown & brown [2007] famca 151, (2007) flc 93-316, and confirmed in the case of rahman & rahman [2013] famcafc 162 (see [54]), that section 114 of the family law act provides a source of power for an order that restrains freedom of movement of a party in a financial case in order to ensure compliance. the relevant principles were summarised by bennett j in fowles and fowles (no 2) [2019] famca 1027 at [13]- [14] and endorsed on appeal by williams j in fowles and fowles (no 2) [2021] fedcfamc1f 209 at [51]. the case of castles and pesic [2008] famca 1003 is a particularly relevant example of a matter where an injunction was made against a party who was found to have significant undisclosed assets and a history of failing to pay moneys to the other party. there is ample evidence before the court that the first respondent, despite his apparent impecuniousness, travels frequently to country b, and has family there. the applicant holds concerns, in the light of statements made by the first respondent to her during the marriage (see for example the applicant\u2019s trial affidavit at [38]), that the first respondent may attempt to depart from australia as a way of avoiding enforcement of any money order. further, while the first respondent denied it (see transcript p58 l4-18), the applicant gave evidence (see transcript p74), supported by a contemporaneous file note made by the applicant\u2019s lawyer (see applicant\u2019s tender bundle p16), that the first respondent had said words to the effect to her that: he does not like being told what to do, and if the court makes orders he does not like, he will ignore them. it is submitted that, in a \u2018show cause\u2019 situation arising from the first respondent\u2019s lack of frankness in these proceedings, as well as the first respondent\u2019s efforts to hide or dissipate assets that would otherwise be available to satisfy a court order, the court should find that there is a real and not insignificant risk that the first respondent will take steps up to and including leaving australia to avoid having to meet a property order. the applicant accepts that it is no small thing for an order to be made restricting the first respondent\u2019s travel. nevertheless the applicant submits that considerations in relation to the impact upon the first respondent\u2019s liberty must be balanced against a competing principle relating to the likelihood that the applicant will be denied a remedy if the first respondent\u2019s freedom to leave the jurisdiction is not restrained. the applicant submits that the making of the injunction against the first respondent until full payment of any moneys ordered by way of property settlement is, in all the circumstances of this case, just and convenient. proposed order 3 \u2013 indemnification of the applicant given the significant financial non-disclosure by the first respondent in this case, the applicant seeks the protection of an indemnification order to ensure that: no further claims can be made against her in respect of her former marriage to the respondent, and to the extent that the respondent has other, non-disclosed, liabilities unknown to the applicant, those will be matters solely for the respondent to deal with. insofar as the first respondent allegedly owes his father $15,000 for the toyota landcruiser, it is submitted that it is appropriate that the applicant be indemnified in respect of this alleged loan given the original purpose of the loan was to buy tools and insurance for the first respondent\u2019s business, further, it is not listed in the first respondent\u2019s financial statement as a current liability. annexure current assets (as per financial statements) post separation assets current

necessitates wife borrowing money to obtain alternative transport written submissions on behalf of the respondent a. background and nature of the proceedings the proceedings were originally listed for final hearing before his honour judge neville on monday 3 april to wednesday 5 april 2023 in respect of parenting and property matters. on monday 3 april 2023 the parents and the independent children\u2019s lawyer were able to resolve the majority of the parenting issues by consent with limited aspects proceeding on a contested basis by way of oral submissions. the independent children\u2019s lawyer was then discharged and property aspects between the applicant wife and respondent husband proceeded to hearing on tuesday 4 april and wednesday 5 april 2023. the applicant wife seeks that the husband pay her the sum of $300 000. the husband\u2019s case is that he has provided adequate disclosure in respect of financial matters between the parties including by way of disclosure between the parties\u2019 solicitors. the husband\u2019s case is that there is only outstanding debt between the parties and that he is not in a position to pay the wife any sum of money. the husband is prepared to individually assume liability for outstanding debts, to allow the wife to remain debt free. relevant to the husband\u2019s case is the fact that the property at 61 town d young (town d property) was repossessed by f bank bank in november 2022. the advice from f bank bank that on settlement of the recent sale of the town d property on or about the easter long weekend on 6 april 2023 or 11 april 2023, it is expected that there will be a shortfall, entails that there is only outstanding debt between the parties. cross examination of the husband took place with the assistance of an arabic interpreter who attended via microsoft teams on tuesday 4 april 2023 and the morning of wednesday 5 april 2023. cross examination of the wife took place on wednesday 5 april 2023 and commenced immediately following cross examination of the husband. a proposed tender bundle on behalf of the wife was received by email at 9:43am on the morning of wednesday 5 april 2023 while the husband was still under cross examination, with the hearing and cross examination of the husband continuing at 10:00am on wednesday 5 april 2023. some documents intended to be included in the proposed tender bundle of the wife were emailed by the counsel for the wife to the counsel and solicitor for the husband at 9:24pm on the night of tuesday 4 april 2023 while the husband was under cross examination. included in the proposed tender bundle for the wife emailed at 9:43am on the morning of wednesday 5 april 2023 but not included in the documents emailed at 9:24pm on the night of tuesday 4 april 2023, were copies of two statements dated tuesday 16 january 2018 which purport to be signed by the wife\u2019s parents zakaria abdulrazzak al massri and noha mohamad kheir al dine al massri. the statements had not previously been disclosed by the wife to the husband and were effectively disclosed to the husband for the first time during examination in chief of the wife on wednesday 5 april 2023 under circumstances where the husband did not have access to an interpreter in court given the interpreter was at the time allocated to support and assist the wife via microsoft teams. the original statements appear to be in arabic and obtained in country b. while copies of statutory declarations of the husband\u2019s father mahmoud wehbe and brother mr e wehbe dated 24 january 2018 which had been prepared for provision to centrelink were annexed at annexure t to the wife\u2019s trial affidavit sworn 13 march 2023, the statements of the wife\u2019s parents were not annexed to this affidavit. at the close of evidence on wednesday 5 april 2023, judge neville directed that the parties agree on a joint tender bundle of documents and that this be filed with the court. the wife subsequently pressed for the statements of her parents dated 16 january 2018 to be included in the joint tender bundle. the husband objects to the statements from the wife\u2019s parents being received as evidence. on monday 17 april 2023, after conferring with the solicitors for the wife, the solicitors for the husband requested by email to judge neville\u2019s associate that the matter be urgently relisted before his honour to allow the husband\u2019s objection in respect of the statements from the wife\u2019s parents dated 16 january 2018 to be dealt with. on tuesday 18 april 2023, judge neville\u2019s associate emailed the solicitors and counsel for the parties, noting the advice from his honour that the parties prepare an agreed tender bundle by consent and limited individual tender bundles which were to include any documents that are not agreed. his honour advised that any issues arising from documents provided and how much weight is to be given to these documents may be addressed in written submissions. these submissions on behalf of the husband are further to the case outline of the husband filed on 27 march 2023. the husband continues to rely on the written submissions provided in the case outline dated 27 march 2023 in relation to relevant factors under section 79(4) and section 75(2) of the family act 1975 (cth) in respect of contributions and future needs. b. statements of the wife\u2019s parents dated 16 january 2018 the statements of the wife\u2019s parents were not put to the husband in cross examination of the husband. there was clearly opportunity for this to occur given the proposed tender bundle of the wife was emailed at 9:43am on the morning of wednesday 5 april 2023 and cross examination of the husband continued shortly after this on the morning of wednesday 5 april 2023 at 10:00am. the hearing that proceeded on 4 and 5 april 2023 was in respect of property aspects only, and accordingly the rules of evidence and provisions of the evidence act 1995 (cth) (evidence act) apply. it is submitted that the court should exercise its discretion under section 135(a) and (b) of the evidence act to exclude the statements from the wife\u2019s parents from being admitted into evidence. in the circumstances of the present proceedings, the probative value of the statements of the wife\u2019s parents is substantially outweighed by the danger that the statements would be unfairly prejudicial to the husband. the probative value of the statements from the wife\u2019s parents is additionally substantially outweighed by the danger that the statements might be misleading or confusing. the statements raise a considerable issue as to the credibility of the wife\u2019s evidence. admission of the statements into evidence would require the husband to account for a total of $70 000 on the basis of documents which the husband was never cross examined about. the husband\u2019s evidence has always been that the wife has not adequately disclosed about the alleged loans from her parents. accordingly, at paragraphs 146-147 of the husband\u2019s trial affidavit affirmed 24 march 2023, the husband states: i understand the applicant is alleging that her father gave me a loan of $40,000. i deny this. in any event, the applicant has not substantiated such alleged loan given to me by her father. i understand the applicant is alleging that she obtained a loan of $30,0000 from her mother. i deny receiving any money from her mother at the commencement or during the relationship. an objection had also been made on the husband\u2019s behalf on tuesday 4 april 2023 about the alleged loans from the wife\u2019s parents not being supported by evidence. in examination in chief of the wife by her counsel, it was the wife\u2019s evidence that the statements of the wife\u2019s parents dated 16 january 2018 were prepared for submission to centrelink along with the statutory declarations of the husband\u2019s father and brother dated 24 january 2018. no where is this mentioned in the wife\u2019s affidavit evidence. no where was it mentioned through the course of documentary disclosure and correspondence between the husband\u2019s solicitors and the wife\u2019s solicitors. it was additionally the wife\u2019s evidence in examination in chief that the wife had no knowledge of either of the loans during the relationship between the husband and the wife, as the loans were discussed between the wife\u2019s parents and the husband only, and only the husband received any money from the wife\u2019s parents. this contradicts the notion of the alleged loan of $30 000 from the wife\u2019s mother being \u201cobtained\u201d by the wife from her mother. it also contradicts the wording of the statement from the wife\u2019s father translated as \u201ci sent batches of money with my relatives and friends to my daughter resident in australia.\u201d the husband\u2019s objection needs to be considered in the context of the significance of credibility issues in respect of the husband and wife in the proceedings. relevant to this is the \u201cshow cause\u201d procedure under which it is proposed issues in contest in the property proceedings be dealt with. in particular, central to the proceedings are issues of financial disclosure and credibility of the husband in respect of matters for which he says he has made adequate disclosure. further, the court is clearly concerned about providing financially for the four children of the marriage for who the wife will be the primary carer and in circumstances where the wife and children are living in emergency housing and reliant on centrelink for financial support. admissibility of the statements of the wife\u2019s parents into evidence would lead to a considerable danger that significance will be given to the alleged loans from the wife\u2019s parents in the context of the relevant issues in the proceedings. within the scope of possible outcomes arising from admission of the statements of the wife\u2019s parents into evidence would be a finding by the court that the husband should not be believed about the alleged loans from the wife\u2019s parents. c. show cause approach and disclosure by the husband the husband objects to the proceedings being dealt with by way of a \u201cshow cause approach\u201d requiring the husband to address why the orders sought by the wife should not be made.9 it is understood that this approach was raised by the court on the grounds of the line of decisions in chang v su [2002] famca 156, mezzacappa v mezzacappa [1987] famca 20, (1987) 11 fam lr 957, stein v stein [1986] famca 27, (1986) 11 fam lr 353 and weir v weir [1992] famca 69, (1993) 16 fam lr 154. the husband\u2019s position is that both this line of authority and a \u201cshow cause\u201d approach does not apply given his case is that he has made full and frank disclosure, and that the relevant facts and circumstances in the present proceedings are accordingly not the kind of facts and circumstances for which the principles in chang v su and other cases were intended to apply. the wife\u2019s evidence under cross examination was that the justification for the $300 000 payment she seeks from the husband is the value of the town d property. as the town d property is the primary asset in the asset pool, even if the significant outstanding mortgage to f bank bank in the amount of $283 899.74 at 3 march 2023 is ignored, this would in effect amount to the wife being allocated nearly the entire value of the asset pool, which could not amount to a fair and equitable split of the pool of assets. the husband\u2019s evidence and financial disclosure in relation to the town d property is as summarised in the chronology below. d. conclusion the statements of the wife\u2019s parents dated 16 january 2018 should not be admitted into evidence as admission into evidence would be contrary to section 135(a) and (b) of the evidence act, and would amount to an outcome that is unfairly prejudicial to the husband. it is not appropriate for a \u201cshow cause\u201d approach to be applied. the following of such approach would amount to an error of law, especially to the extent that any application of such an approach seeks to provide financially for the children and the wife in circumstances where the children and wife have been residing in emergency accommodation and relying on centrelink for financial support. it is not open for the court to conclude that the husband retains sufficient wealth of the parties such that any sum could be paid by the husband to the wife, leaving the husband in a position that he still has adequate assets for the outcome in the proceedings to be just and equitable. outline of principle ] section 79 demands a consideration, separately, of all of its requirements without conflation. provided a trial judge has done so, and the reasons demonstrate that this has been done, no error is demonstrated by a failure to follow a particular order in doing so. further, the breadth and depth of the consideration of the s.79(2) issue, and the extent of an adequate exposition of it in the reasons, will vary from case to case. in that respect, the plurality in bevan said, at [82], that the separate s.79(2) issue will, \u201c...in many cases ... [be] ... effectively answered in the affirmative by the way the parties present their cases.\u201d [20] each of those conclusions conforms entirely with what was said about those issues by the high court in stanford v stanford (2012) 247 clr 108. [21] first, it is \u201c...not possible to chart [the] metes and bounds\u201d of the relevant discretion. just as importantly, it was recognised specifically that the characteristics of individual marriage unions, in so far as they acquire, hold and deal with property, differ. in \u201cmany cases\u201d, the union is underpinned by \u201c...stated and unstated assumptions between the parties to a marriage that the arrangement of property interests, whatever they are, is sufficient for the purposes of the husband and wife during the continuance of their marriage\u201d (stanford, at [41]). and, in \u201cmany cases\u201d, (but, not all) the \u201c...just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied...\u201d by the fact of separation: \u201c[i]t will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order ... because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife\u201d (stanford at [42]). \u201c...what is \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 will vary in the eyes of different beholders\u201d and also the fact that the \u201c...functions and purposes of the court ... [involve] ... difficult and evaluative decisions...\u201d such that \u201c...any two decision-makers may, with complete integrity and upon the same material, often come to differing conclusions\u201d. (cdj at [186(2)], per kirby j). ] ... as we have already said, there is no requirement to attribute different percentages to different periods in the relationship. indeed the full court has cautioned against it: see dickons & dickons [2012] famcafc 154, (2012) 50 fam lr 244, lovine & connor and anor [2012] famcafc 168, (2012) flc 93-515 and bolger & headon [2014] famcafc 27 where the full court said at [28], \u201c[d]oing so ... is not consistent with a holistic assessment of the parties\u2019 contributions which is what s.79(4) requires.\u201d it is only if error can be demonstrated in the overall result that the appeal would succeed. 8] ... the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by s.79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period. ] any and all such contributions, whether or not they sound in, or are directly linked to, the property available for distribution, should be considered and assessed together with the nature, form and extent of all other contributions of all types contemplated otherwise by s 79(4). [19] that is true of assets or income generated within the relationship and it is equally true of assets or income coming from outside of the relationship (for example, as here, in the form of inheritances). in the same way, s 79(4) specifically requires the court to take into account contributions made to the welfare of the family (and substantively and \u201c...not in any merely token way...\u201d, see, mallett v mallett [1984] hca 21, (1984) 156 clr 605 at 636 per wilson j) notwithstanding that those contributions may not be, or cannot be seen to be, directly linked to the available property at trial, or any increase or decrease in the value of the property. [20] put another way, consistent with authority, the s 79 discretion involves as a necessary requirement that \u201c... trial judges weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such an assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties or provide for a transfer of property in specie in accordance with that assessment.\u201d (in the marriage of aleksovski [1996] famcafc 111, (1996) 20 fam lr 894 at 903). in aleksovski, kay j outlined the well-known \u201cgold bar\u201d analogy and said \u201c[w]hat is important is to somehow give a reasonable value to all of the elements that go to making up the entirety of the marriage relationship\u201d (at 83,443). [21] those same principles can be expressed as saying that the requirements of the section are met by approaching the assessment of contributions holistically and by analysing the nature, form, characteristics and origin of the property currently comprising that to which s 79 applies, and, in turn, analysing the nature, form and extent of the contributions (of all types) contemplated by s 79. that task is also undertaken by reference to the nature and form of the particular marriage partnership manifested by the particular circumstances of this particular marriage. is it, for example, a relationship, as deane j put it in mallett at 640-641 \u201c...where the parties have adopted the attitude that their marriage constituted a practical union of both lives and property...\u201d or is it, for example, a union where parties lived very separate domestic and financial lives? [22] the analysis just referred to might, obviously enough, also involve an examination of when contributions were made and the use made of contributions. but that is quite different to attributing to, or searching for, a necessary causal connection between contributions and the available property as a requirement for a particular contribution having significance in the overall assessment of what is just and equitable. ] we wish also to refer to the approach of the federal magistrate in attributing percentages to differing periods within the relationship, or types of contribution made. there is in our view little to be gained, and much to be said against, approaching the task of assessing contributions by attaching percentages to components of it. (the same, it might be said, applies to attributing a percentage to each of the relevant s 75(2) factors). [24] there can be little doubt that the classification of contributions by reference to terms such as \u201cinitial contributions\u201d, \u201ccontributions during the relationship\u201d, and \u201cpost-separation contributions\u201d, can be helpful as a convenient means of giving coherent expression to the evidence in a s 79 case and to giving coherence to the nature, form and extent of the parties\u2019 respective contributions. however, the task of assessing contributions is holistic and but part of a yet further holistic determination of what orders, if any, represent justice and equity in the particular circumstances of this particular relationship. so much is clear from the terms of s 79 itself and, in particular, s 79(2). the essential task is to assess the nature, form and extent of the contributions of all types made by each of the parties within the context of an analysis of their particular relationship. [25] doing so is also consistent with the demands of authority that the ultimate assessment of contributions should be made without \u201c...giving over-zealous attention to the ascertainment of the parties\u2019 contributions...\u201d (norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513 at 524) and the well-established recognition in the authorities (acknowledged specifically by her honour in this case) that the process required of the court by s 79 is the exercise of a wide discretion, not the performance of a mathematical or accounting exercise. [26] the necessarily imprecise \u201cwide discretion\u201d inherent in what is required by the section is made no more precise or coherent by attributing percentage figures to arbitrary time frames or categorisations of contributions within the relationship. indeed, we consider that doing so is contrary to the holistic analysis required by the section and, in the usual course of events, should be avoided. the consideration of the relevant matters referred to in s.75(2) of the act, pursuant to s.79(4), like the assessment of contributions, is holistic. also, like the assessment of contributions, it is not an accounting exercise. the reference to \"financial resources\" in the context of s.75(2)(b) has long been correctly interpreted by the family court to refer to \"a source of financial support which a party can reasonably expect will be available to him or her to supply a financial need or deficiency\". the requirement that the financial resource be that \"of\" a party no doubt implies that the source of financial support be one on which the party is capable of drawing. it must involve something more than an expectation of benevolence on the part of another. but it goes too far to suggest that the party must control the source of financial support... section 75(2)(o) plainly extends to any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account as showing that a party to the marriage is or is not able to pay spousal maintenance or is or is not able to support himself or herself. the paragraph has accordingly long been correctly interpreted by the family court as permitting consideration by a court of \"all of the financial matters which are relevant to [a] particular case\". nothing in the language or structure of s.75 prevents a fact or circumstance which falls within s.75(2)(o) being also a fact or circumstance which gives rise to a matter under another paragraph of s.75(2), including s.75(2)(b). ... once it has been established that there has been a deliberate non-disclosure ... then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. to do otherwise might be thought to provide a charter for fraud in proceedings of this nature. in circumstances where there has not been full and frank disclosure of financial circumstances by a party, it is open to a court to find that an indeterminate undisclosed amount is held by one of the parties and to make property orders without reference to an overall pool. ... however if, as here, one party fails to fulfil that obligation, is it open to that party then to rely on the absence of satisfactory evidence to prevent the making of an order against him or her which otherwise justice and equity would require? it would be simple, if that were the case, to evade the jurisdiction of this court, not by outright refusal which would attract sanctions but by obfuscation and evasion.\u2019 it seems to us that once it has been established that there has been a deliberate non-disclosure, which follows from his honour's findings in this case, then the court should not be unduly cautious about making findings in favour of the innocent party. to do otherwise might be thought to provide a charter for fraud in proceedings of this nature. consideration and disposition property interests,

(emphasis added) \"respondent\" , in relation to a divorce or the annulment of a marriage or the legal separation of the parties to a marriage, means a party to the marriage, not being a party at whose instance the divorce, annulment or legal separation was effected whether common law rules of private international law requires recognition of the parties divorce pursuant to s 104(5) of the act? any divorce or any annulment of a marriage, or any legal separation of the parties to a marriage, that would be recognised as valid under the common law rules of private international law but to which none of the preceding provisions of this section applies shall be recognised as valid in australia, and the operation of this subsection shall not be limited by any implication from those provisions. the present convention shall apply to the recognition in one contracting state of divorces and legal separations obtained in another contracting state which follow judicial or other proceedings officially recognised in that state and which are legally effective there. the convention does not apply to findings of fault or to ancillary orders pronounced on the making of a decree of divorce or legal separation, in particular, it does not apply to orders relating to pecuniary obligations or to the custody of children. the courts of australia are not presumed to have any knowledge of foreign law. decisions about the content of foreign law create no precedent. that is why foreign law is a question of fact to be proved by expert evidence. in my opinion, it would be in accordance with the developments i have mentioned and with the trend of legislation\u2014mainly our own but also that of other countries with similar social systems\u2014to recognise divorces given to wives by the courts of their residence wherever a real and substantial connection is shown between the petitioner and the country, or territory, exercising jurisdiction, i use these expressions so as to enable the courts, who must decide each case, to consider both the length and quality of the residence and to take into account such other factors as nationality which may reinforce the connection. equally they would enable the courts (as they habitually do without difficulty) to reject residence of passage or residence, to use the descriptive expression of the older cases, resorted to by persons who properly should seek relief here for the purpose of obtaining relief which our courts would not give. consideration apply public policy considerations, as they are relevant to the recognition of the parties\u2019 country j divorce \u2014 including that the \u2018comity\u2019 or \u2018courtesy of nations\u2019 supports the general recognition, as far as practicable, of each other\u2019s laws extending to recognition of divorce orders. (b) consider the notion of reciprocity as identified in travers v holley[24]\u2014 that is, if the same facts and circumstances arose in australia as they did in country j, would a divorce have been granted in australia? (c) consider whether there a real and substantive connection between the husband and country j \u2014 where the divorce was obtained \u2014 and whether the decree for divorce was obtained for genuine reasons and not resorted to solely for the purpose of obtaining the divorce because it was not available to him in australia? i will deal with the first two factors together. consider the notion of reciprocity as identified in travers v holley[24]\u2014 that is, if the same facts and circumstances arose in australia as they did in country j, would a divorce have been granted in australia?

(emphasis added) 6. point: the evidence let in by the petitioners would show that the petitioners are husband and wife and they are unable to continue the matrimonial relationship as their relationship is irretrievably broken due to difference of opinion. therefore, both of them had taken a decision to have a decree for divorce. there is no collusion between the parties. on consideration of the evidence on record it is found that the petitioners are entitled to get a decree for divorce as sought for. point is therefore found in favour of the petitioners. esiding \u2018separately from 14.12.2018 due to difference of opinion. though several reconciliation efforts were made no positive results could be achieved. the matrimonial relationship is irretrievably broken down. ultimately they had taken a decision to obtain a divorce by mutual consent.[28] conclusion associate: dated: 11 september 2023 dated: 11 september 2023 [1] wife\u2019s application for nullity filed 5 march 2019 pursuant to the marriages act 1995.

relationship. 4aa(4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case. ... ... each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point at one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitude and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test. relevant relationship history in this case 25 in 2006, there was an incident between [mr besser] and i as follows: [mr besser] was not living with me at this time but was

hitting me in the back of the head. i was knocked unconscious and when i regained consciousness i was on the floor in the hallway. i was bleeding heavily from the back of my head. i was in shock and scared for my safety. i recall that [mr besser] had a gun with him. i was able to locate bullets in his bag and put them in a pot plant in my home. i was terrified that he would shoot me if he found them. once [mr besser] realised the bullets were missing, he came into the spare bedroom, where i was sitting in the corner, hiding, trying to stop the bleeding, and he started yelling at me and demanding the bullets. during this argument i could hear other people in my home, i was not aware who these people were. [mr besser] proceeded to hit me in the head and body and i not sure [sic] whether it was his fists or the gun. after some time, i took an opportunity to grab my car keys to try and go to the hospital. as i was trying to start my car, he grabbed me and pulled me out of the car. he kicked me repeatedly in the front yard yelling at me to get back into the house. i was scared that i was going to die on this occasion. [mr besser] forced me to sit at the kitchen table and called me horrible and degrading names and told me that i was a \u2018dead woman\u2019. he forced me into his car and drove me around for a while. after he finally took me home, he told me words to the effect of \u201cif you call the cops, i\u2019m going to come back to finish you off.\u201d due to my fear of him, i did not contact the police. approximately two (2) weeks later, he returned to my home and accused me of stealing his guns. he hit me with [an object]. as he searched my home, i ran to a neighbour\u2019s home and begged them not to open the door and to call the police. [mr besser] came to their door with a knife demanding that they neighbours [sic] send me out. i was terrified that he would get through the door or that the neighbours would make me leave. once the police arrived, they took my statement and [mr besser] had already returned to his residence at [g street]. i was informed by the police when the police attended to arrest [mr besser], that he appeared from behind the lounge and pointed a gun at the police and threatened to shoot the officer. following this was a [...] siege before the police were able to enter safety and arrest him. 26 in [late] 2015, there was an incident between [mr besser] and i as follows: [mr besser] and i drove to melbourne and stayed in a motel overnight. [mr besser] became angry towards me and began accusing me of cheating on him, i was standing next to the bed and [mr besser] shoved me causing me to fall across the bed. i was concerned for my safety and scared of [mr besser], so the following morning i changed motels. [mr besser] sent me a message words to the effect of \u201cyou\u2019re a gutless piece of shit\u201d and further stated that i should catch a bus or train home and demanded that i had to transfer $20,000 into his account within twenty-four (24) hours or not to bother returning home. [in late] 2015, [mr besser] texted me and told me that he had asked a friend to go to my house and get all of his belongings. [mr besser] sent me a further text messaged stating that he had told his friend that if my son, [mr j], was to get in his was that he was \u2018free to take care of him\u2019. [mr besser] advised me that he was catching a flight and that he would be waiting at my home with a petrol drum. [in late] 2015, [mr besser] sent me a text message advising that he was burning his way through my wardrobe. [in late] 2015, [mr besser] sent me a text message stating words to the effect of \u201cyou got the check for me?\u201d he further sent pictures and videos of him burning my clothes and shoes. i felt unsafe and stayed in melbourne for a few days hoping that [mr besser] would calm down and i could return home. as i had packed minimal clothes and observed [mr besser] to be burning my clothes at home, i purchased two suitcases of new clothing. i do not recall that day that i returned home from melbourne, however, [mr besser] was waiting for me when i arrived. i had to walk around to the back door as i was unable to open the front door. i saw [mr besser] sitting on the back steps with a petrol container next to him. i dropped the suitcases and tried to run for my life from [mr besser]. [mr besser] grabbed me outside of the neighbour\u2019s house and knocked me to the ground. i thought that i was going to die. [mr besser] proceeded to jump on me, punching me in the face several times and stated words to the effect of \u201ci\u2019m going to break your nose.\u201d i recall there being another person present who was speaking to [mr besser] and they both left me on the ground. after a period of time, i was able to stumble to the shops nearby and i hid at the back of one of the shops. the owner let me use his phone to call the police. i observed [mr besser] to be driving past the shops look around [sic] for me. i was so scared that he was going to find me. the police arrived and took me to the police station where i made a statement, and i was informed that upon the police attending my home that [mr besser] was nowhere to be found. i returned home and had to smash the window to gain entry as the front door had been padlocked from the inside and the back door had also been padlocked. i continued to significantly be concerned for my safety and worried that [mr besser] would return and try to burn me in my home with both doors padlocked. as a result, i left to go stay a friend\u2019s house for several days. as a result of this assault, i had a broken nose and black eyes. i was bruised on my arm and had scratches on my ear. after i was informed that [mr besser] was in custody, i returned home. however, approximately a week later, i was informed by one of [mr besser's] friends that [mr besser] had been bailed and was at [k mental health centre]. i spoke to [mr besser], and he sounded sincere regarding his actions and that he was trying to help and work on his aggression towards me. [mr besser] informed me that they would not release him without a place to stay and that he had nowhere else to go. [mr besser] begged me to let him back into my home. i regretfully allowed [mr besser] to return to my home, however, i wanted to believe that he was sorry and i also scared of what he would do if i did not let him back into my home. i attended court in relation to this assault and [mr besser] was found guilty. [mr besser] was not sentenced to any gaol time. however, a final advo was put in place for my protection for 12 months. finished, over, & done. you don\u2019t care how i feel, i have no say. you constantly do things that you know will piss me off. let people in my house who are scum even when i ask you not to. i think the only reason you are still at my house is your to lazy..... you sit around doing nothing all day every day. yet you had the hide to say [mr j] was lazy & doing nothing. telling me you wash up and vacuum everyday, lies, to get me & [mr j] fighting. you have everyone running around for you & you don\u2019t and can\u2019t be bothered to do anything to make me happy. i sick of you snoring every night & doing nothing about it. when i got tv on it\u2019s the end of the world cause you can\u2019t sleep. welcome to my world. i have to say that i know you take pleasure in pissing me off. and go out of your way to be a cunt to me. i put up with your crap for too long, over it!! did the de facto relationship end in 2018? ... between 2018 to 2021, i asked [mr besser] to move out on many occasions, however, this would result in [mr besser] becoming very angry, aggressive and violent towards me including screaming and yelling at me, punching me or pushing me to the ground. due to this i became incredibly fearful for my safety if i mentioned [mr besser] moving out. did the de facto relationship resume thereafter and only come to a final end in 2021? the motor vehicle 2: this [motor vehicle 2] rego [...] has been stolen. it belongs to my partner [mr besser]. it\u2019s been stolen by a so called friend of his [mr o], who is a low life theivin\u2019 dog. he is a total dickhead, a wanna be using [mr besser]\u2019s name. i am offering a reward to any one who can tell me where the car is.

[x] began to kick out at police and thrash her arms and legs, resisting being removed from the [motor vehicle]. [x] was exhibiting extreme distress and continued to scream and struggle. [x] was eventually removed from the [motor vehicle] and placed in the rear of the police vehicle where she continued to struggle for approximately 30 seconds, before calming once the vehicle doors were shut and likely realising the recovery order would be executed without her consent. afp drove [x] to the home address of [jaros] [the mother], [k street, suburb l] sa. upon arrival about 2.45am, police arrived at [jaros\u2019] address and [x] entered the premises address along with [jaros] and [jaros\u2019] mother, executing the recovery order. issues in dispute should the parties have equal shared parental responsibility for x?

[ms schuyler] reported that [x] mainly screams and wants others to figure out what she wants, reporting that it becomes worse after access visits with the father. [x] currently sees her father of a weekend for a few hours a day, with [ms schuyler] also reporting that these visits with her father have regressed her speech, sleep routine and behaviours. dad left alone? - yes, on tuesday. where did he go? - to [g]\u2019s house. is would be a reference to g.) leave you in the day? - yes. who at home? - no-one. clarified: dad left you at home by self? - no. mum said you told her about being scared that dad was going to hurt you. - no. he doesn\u2019t let [g] hurt me. he puts her in her room. reframed the question. - no, he never said that. so, again, the child denying that the father had hurt her in some way or that he had behaved in some other abusive manner towards her. the psychologist then asked x: why did you tell mum that? - because mum she would be mad at daddy. why do you want mum to be mad at daddy? - i don\u2019t know. attended therapy session with mother [ms schuyler] and grandmother [ms m]\u2013 m being the maternal grandmother) at their family home in [suburb l]. [x] greeted clinician at front door. [x] was noted to say that she misses her dad. but mother, [ms schuyler], said that she was just saying that to be spiteful as, when it comes to going to her dad\u2019s, she won\u2019t get ready. had a visit with her dad over the weekend. it was noted that he feeds [x] a lot of salty food and [ms schuyler] has addressed this with him and asked him to reduce [x]\u2019s salt intake as her diet and nutrition is poor at his house. i would appreciate a response in how you would like to proceed with this weekend. [x] is also saying she doesn\u2019t want to come as she\u2019s in pain with the [medical condition] and just wants to stay home. unfortunately, without the prescribed creams, you will not be able to provide [x] with the medical treatments required while in your care. therefore [x] will not be able to attend on medical grounds. dear [dr p], thank you very much for your referral of [x] to [q company] for concerns with regards to challenging behaviours, including defiance, aggression and anxiety.

[x] also mentioned she is scared that dad will kill her. i told [x] to try not to worry when she is at school, as we have nice big fences and we will do our best to protect her. this made her happy and she went back to class. hi, [ms s]. i have attached notes taken from a meeting in july with the independent children\u2019s lawyer assigned to [x]. i spoke with [ms schuyler] yesterday afternoon. avo against dad ([mr derren]) was dismissed on wednesday due to lack of evidence. [ms schuyler] said that [x] would not talk, so the evidence could not be provided. weekend visits start again today. apparently, [x] is \u201cterrified\u201d and mum feels she has to force her to go. last visit with dad was 14 march. mum made dcj report that dad had \u201cheld [x] at knifepoint and told her not to tell anyone, if she did he would kill her\u201d. i said that if the father couldn't step up and be the parent that [x] needed, then there should be no contact. the law best interests why do you say the mother doesn\u2019t facilitate a relationship with you? - the little things, resistance at handover. the mother says to the child, \u201cit\u2019s not up to me\u201d. you must do everything a parenting order says. in doing so, you cannot be merely passive but must take positive action and this positive obligation includes taking all reasonable steps to ensure that the order is put into effect. you must also positively encourage your children to comply with the orders. for example, where the order states your children are to spend time with another party, you must not only ensure that the children are available, but must also positively encourage them to go and do so. i hate my dad, family. i hate it so much. i want to punish. ongoing issues with anxiety and behaviour as per mum, more so after she comes back from her father\u2019s house. has been losing weight of late and she is not eating well for a few days before she goes to her dad\u2019s house once a fortnight and for a few days after coming from there as per mother. recent ed presentation with concerns of poor appetite and weight loss in context of her visit to her father. doing better now as she is back to her mum\u2019s house now. feels anxious and apprehensive before she has to go to her father\u2019s house and does not eat well for a few days. some bullying at school as well of late. denies any suicidal plans \u2013 ideas or plans for now. previous seen by psychologist, considered diagnosis of avoid restrictive food intake disorder. however, father discontinued appointments? dcj involvement previously. father and mother currently in proceedings relating to custody, arrangement for [x]. the child loves school, is very happy, wishes she could have naps. she sleeps until 7am. often has breakfast: weetbix, changes every day. definitely has breakfast every day. asked how her world was. all good. bright/chirpy. she hugged me on the way out. conclusion associate: dated: 14 september 2023 dated: 14 september 2023 [1] tender bundle, pp.120 - 121[2] tender bundle, pp.128 - 132[3] tender bundle, pp. 142 - 143[4] there is a typographical error in the notes but this is clearly what was meant", "metadata": {"filename": "1137.txt", "size": 15095, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 15299, "document_id": "1137"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "1137_chunk_0"}}

full court discussed the existence of a court\u2019s discretion to refuse to entertain an application brought by an applicant who is in contempt of orders made in the same proceedings. in contrast, as can be seen, s 69f avails of the discretion to entertain an application in relation to a child brought by an applicant who is in contempt of orders, regardless of when and in what proceedings the breached orders were made. section 69f is intended to invest the court with broad discretion as to whether an application under pt vii of the act, filed by an applicant who has failed to comply with a past order made under the act, is entertained. its initial purpose was to ensure that applicants would not be shut out from contesting orders in respect of children through operation of the common law rule, which operated as a strict rule with specific exceptions at the time s 69f was first enacted as s 66 of the act. now, as a consequence of fahmi and watson, the common law rule is applied more flexibly as a discretionary rule in this jurisdiction. ... when the discretion under s 69f of the act is enlivened, its exercise is motivated by the same type of considerations discussed in fahmi and watson and depends upon the balance which must be struck between the applicant\u2019s right to procedural justice and countervailing public policy considerations, the ambit of which is not confined (watson at [36(g)]). locking an applicant out of procedural access to a court and the consequent deprivation of the opportunity for substantive relief is a serious step and should not be lightly taken. discussion the mother has failed to comply with orders of this court, (b) she has filed an amended application in proceeding which seeks to discharge interim orders, she does not give evidence

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 19 september 2023 federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2) moyland & shearer [2023] fedcfamc2f 1202 orders until further order, the court orders that: reasons for judgment judge w j neville introduction & overview 2] a party has the right to bring proceedings. parties have choices as to what claims are to be made and how they are to be framed. but limits will be placed upon their ability to effect changes to their pleadings, particularly if litigation is advanced. that is why, in seeking the just resolution of the dispute, reference is made to parties having a sufficient opportunity to identify the issues they seek to agitate. [113] in the past it has been left largely to the parties to prepare for trial and to seek the court's assistance as required. those times are long gone. the allocation of power, between litigants and the courts arises from tradition and from principle and policy. it is recognised by the courts that the resolution of disputes serves the public as a whole, not merely the parties to the proceedings. [114] rule 21 of the court procedure rules recognises the purposes of case management by the courts. it recognises that delay and costs are undesirable and that delay has deleterious effects, not only upon the party to the proceedings in question, but to other litigants. the rule's objectives, as to the timely disposal of cases and the limitation of cost, were to be applied in considering anu's application for amendment. it was significant that the effect of its delay in applying would be that a trial was lost and litigation substantially recommenced. it would impact upon other litigants seeking a resolution of their cases. what was a \"just resolution\" of anu's claim required serious consideration of these matters, and not merely whether it had an arguable claim to put forward. a just resolution of its claim necessarily had to have regard to the position of aon in defending it. an assumption that costs will always be a sufficient compensation for the prejudice caused by amendment is not reflected in r 21. critically, the matters relevant to a just resolution of anu's claim required anu to provide some explanation for its delay in seeking the amendment if the discretion under r 502(1) was to be exercised in its favour and to the disadvantage of aon. none was provided. ... adherents to that school of thought would think that a party in the position of anu was under an obligation to burn the midnight oil, to move with a degree of haste, and even to \"rush it\". after all, anu was represented by senior counsel who had delivered a well prepared, lucid and detailed address in order to secure the adjournment from 15 november to 27 november 2006. it was represented also by two junior counsel and a substantial firm of solicitors. it employed at least one solicitor of its own in-house. it was seeking to recover $75 million in a commercial cause which it had chosen to institute in a busy court which had 18 days left of the time fixed for the trial. the amendments should have been ready by the morning of 15 november 2006, or at least it should have been possible to provide them within a few hours thereafter. his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 but if the article was favourable to your client i assume you wouldn\u2019t be making this application? mr duane: well, that\u2019s one way of exploring the issues. that\u2019s a good \u2013 that\u2019s a good \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: i\u2019m just asking the question that if it was \u2013 if the recommendations and the comments, etcetera, were against the father, as i say, presumably \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mr duane: well \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 the mother wouldn\u2019t be making this application. mr duane: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 it wouldn\u2019t be necessary because they \u2013 in \u2013 so the steps are the parties and the court effectively give their approval by way of an order to a particular person as being appropriate and competent to perform the role they\u2019re asked to. and if there are issues that give rise to whether that is the \u2013 whether that order ought to be discharged then wherever they come from then that\u2019s where they come from and that\u2019s a different consideration to whether the same sort of material might be able to be used to say the expert was right or wrong. oral application for discharge of the single expert witness critically, the matters relevant to a just resolution of anu's claim required anu to provide some explanation for its delay in seeking the amendment if the discretion under r 502(1) was to be exercised in its favour and to the disadvantage of aon. none was provided. ms dart: i think it [the abc article] was originally an audio file. nevertheless, while i don\u2019t make a formal objection to your honour reading it i\u2019m unclear as to the basis on which the application is made to disqualify [dr b] as an expert. and, in my submission, that needs to be articulated to say there is a news article, there is a media release where an expert hasn\u2019t been identified but has some connection \u2013 and i use that broadly \u2013 but is more so an expert that works in the family law field and it\u2019s \u2013 her answers are unsatisfactory. how did that lead to an application for disqualification in relation to this matter in circumstances where no evidence has been led as to the conduct of the interviews in this case? no evidence has been led or suggested as to any impropriety of the single expert in this case in the manner that she interviewed the parties or the children or in the way that she conducted her assessment and you haven\u2019t been taken to any of the contents of the report that would give rise to \u2013 in the circumstances of this case a basis for discharge in the particular circumstance of this case. what you\u2019re left with is there has been a media article in which allegations are made. there may be \u2013 or there may not be a complaint. there has certainly been no findings of a regulatory body but on the basis that there might be or on the basis that that was not absolutely disavowed you would remove an expert from this case. and i say the nexus as to disqualification is simply not there. particularly, absent any suggestion about the way that the assessment in this matter was conducted. his honour: perhaps if i just double-check with mr duane. so in terms of \u201clegal principle\u201d what\u2019s the legal principle? is it absent of process? is it procedural unfairness? is it apprehended bias? what is it? mr duane: it\u2019s suitability. so a complete lack of confidence as to the suitability of the expert in circumstances where she has refused to deny that she is the person who is the subject of the article. and that has \u2013 and the difficulties that there has been in engaging with her in any examination of whether there are any issues as to competency as a result of the avoidance of the topic. now, she could easily have said, yes, and here is a copy of the complaint. no doubt this is not the first or the last of the difficulties that will arise as a result of this sorry predicament. and instead, there are excuses and dissemination and avoidance, in my submission, and your honour will make findings about it about some simple inquiries that were \u2013 that you might \u2013 that the court might necessarily wish to embark upon where these issues are raised. there\u2019s just nothing. and it\u2019s that failure to engage \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: no, but how \u2013 sorry to interrupt but how did you draw a link between [dr b] and whatever is in this report or this media story? mr duane: well, that probably doesn\u2019t matter. your honour knows \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: well, i would have thought it does because if this witness \u2013 as she said, \u201ci can\u2019t draw any link between the complaints that i\u2019m aware of and this article,\u201d that you say that\u2019s her avoiding saying yes i was or no i wasn\u2019t the person named. mr duane: well, she came straight out with it, \u201ci can\u2019t answer it for legal reasons.\u201d you know, her first answer is almost a pre-prepared answer on the topic. a legal defence to answering the question. your honour, it\u2019s common knowledge \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry, what\u2019s common knowledge? mr duane: who the author of the report is. his honour: well, i\u2019m sorry. i hate to \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mr duane: not common to your honour. his honour: i hate to live in a cave but it\u2019s not common knowledge to me. mr duane: well \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: you know, do i have to make a \u2013 you know, some sort of a check with all of the family consultants of the court or what? mr duane: clearly, the \u2013 well, clearly, it wasn\u2019t common knowledge to your honour or you would have done something about it or mentioned it in the trial if you thought it was a problem. his honour: i didn\u2019t know anything about any of this until you raised it for the first time and your application seems to be based primarily upon the responses or what you say the evasive responses of [dr b] as opposed to whatever you or your client \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t have been able to speak to her last night when you first became aware of it. whatever the basis was of drawing whatever connections between this article when you became aware of it and flagging it this morning to your colleagues. mr duane: yes. well, she\u2019s very \u2013 so my client\u2019s position is that the report writing process was very much against her and that the \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: and \u2013 sorry. and where and how is this raised other than now from you? mr duane: well, it would be certainly raised during the course of cross\u2011examination if we had to get there \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry. mr duane: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 but, for example, if i can just deal with this in submissions. she gives various opinions which are not explained in terms of the basis for arriving at the opinions. many of them are assessments that rely on her integrity in terms of assessing and putting a label on behaviours. so there was some fairly pejorative descriptions of the mother including a suggestion that she moved \u2013 her move to brisbane was manipulative. and \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry, this is \u2013 this is getting more into like the usual kinds of queries about whether or not there was a legal basis for the opinion and the connection there. mr duane: but \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: that\u2019s a different thing to running an application now because there was this media story about someone who did or didn\u2019t do (a), (b) or (c) whatever it is. mr duane: well, your honour, it isn\u2019t raised lightly. the contents of the article which you will see \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: i\u2019m [not] suggesting it was. mr duane: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 when they were raised were raised for squarely the suitability if any \u2013 if the things that are set out in the \u2013 which are recorded in the articles. so the article deals with one of the two parties taking lengthy recordings of what occurred during therapy. so this isn\u2019t something that the abc \u2013 they\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not talking about the \u2013 i\u2019m assuming there might be the [town c newspaper] or something like that. there might be a small media enterprise making publications. this is a reputable \u2013 large reputable organisation that has done an investigation and produced a report and there are recordings. so on the face of it, it is a matter \u2013 that they are matters that are worthy of some explanation. and what explanation have you been given? it\u2019s totally unsatisfactory. his honour: sorry, an explanation about what? mr duane: well, if \u2013 so one might expect that if the single expert was not the person referred to the \u2013 in the article they could simply say so rather than all of what you heard. his honour: well, you\u2019ve kind of \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mr duane: and \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mentioned it a number of times so i\u2019ve got that point. mr duane: all right. i will try not to be any more repetitive. regarding the oral discharge application: summary of dr b\u2019s evidence ...certainly, if your professional conduct or professional ethics had been called into question significantly, you ought to reveal that the court in the course of these proceedings, is that right or not? --- ...well, there is no issue. your honour, i consider the question is greatly improper. i am prevented by answering by a whole lot of both commonwealth laws and state laws. you might want to know that difficulties with complaints are \u2013 is a universal and international problem of which i have spoken about to a senate inquiry [...]. it\u2019s an improper question. his honour: so do i take that as a formal objection to the question \u2011 \u2011 \u2011?\u2011\u2011\u2011i do, your \u2013 you do, your honour. right?\u2011\u2011\u2011i am happy to answer questions about this matter, but i think the question is improper, and i am prevented from answering. mr duane: well, your honour, i\u2019ve been chipping away \u2013 that\u2019s all i have been doing \u2013 trying to get through the article and trying to get the concession that there is a \u2013 about whether or not there is a complaint that has \u2013 that is active in relation to the contents of this article. his honour: but i thought [dr b] had already responded to that, namely, she can\u2019t make any connection between the three outstanding complaints, at the moment, relating to therapy and what is or is not in this article. mr duane: well, she can only do that if she knows \u2013 as read the article in detail. we\u2019re dancing around this subject, with respect, your honour. she does have \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: i have worked that out. something that i thought and was told might be 10 minutes/might be 15 \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mr duane: well, i didn\u2019t expect \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: well, we haven\u2019t really got that one. mr duane: i didn\u2019t expect this level of avoidance. his honour: well, it might be characterised by someone else in a different way, but \u2013 whatever \u2013 ask your questions, but i\u2019m not sure, really, for how much longer. how many more \u2013 how much more of the article have you \u2013 do you say that you\u2019ve got to traverse, especially having regard to what [dr b] has said? submissions submissions: counsel for the mother ms dart: i think it was

probably doesn\u2019t matter. your honour knows \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: well, i would have thought it does because if this witness \u2013 as she said, \u201ci can\u2019t draw any link between the complaints that i\u2019m aware of and this article,\u201d that you say that\u2019s her avoiding saying yes i was or no i wasn\u2019t the person named. mr duane: well, she came straight out with it, \u201ci can\u2019t answer it for legal reasons.\u201d you know, her first answer is almost a pre-prepared answer on the topic. a legal defence to answering the question. your honour, it\u2019s common knowledge \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry, what\u2019s common knowledge? mr duane: who the author of the report is. his honour: well, i\u2019m sorry. i hate to \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mr duane: not common to your honour. his honour: i hate to live in a cave but it\u2019s not common knowledge to me. mr duane: well \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: you know, do i have to make a \u2013 you know, some sort of a check with all of the family consultants of the court or what? mr duane: clearly, the \u2013 well, clearly, it wasn\u2019t common knowledge to your honour or you would have done something about it or mentioned it in the trial if you thought it was a problem. his honour: i didn\u2019t know anything about any of this until you raised it for the first time and your application seems to be based primarily upon the responses or what you say the evasive responses of [dr b] as opposed to whatever you or your client \u2013 but you wouldn\u2019t have been able to speak to her last night when you first became aware of it. whatever the basis was of drawing whatever connections between this article when you became aware of it and flagging it this morning to your colleagues. mr duane: yes. well, she\u2019s very \u2013 so my client\u2019s position is that the report writing process was very much against her and that the \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: and \u2013 sorry. and where and how is this raised other than now from you? mr duane: well, it would be certainly raised during the course of cross\u2011examination if we had to get there \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry. mr duane: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 but, for example, if i can just deal with this in submissions. she gives various opinions which are not explained in terms of the basis for arriving at the opinions. many of them are assessments that rely on her integrity in terms of assessing and putting a label on behaviours. so there was some fairly pejorative descriptions of the mother including a suggestion that she moved \u2013 her move to brisbane was manipulative. and \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry, this is \u2013 this is getting more into like the usual kinds of queries about whether or not there was a legal basis for the opinion and the connection there. mr duane: but \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: that\u2019s a different thing to running an application now because there was this media story about someone who did or didn\u2019t do (a), (b) or (c) whatever it is. mr duane: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 when they were raised were raised for squarely the suitability if any \u2013 if the things that are set out in the \u2013 which are recorded in the articles. so the article deals with one of the two parties taking lengthy recordings of what occurred during therapy. so this isn\u2019t something that the abc \u2013 they\u2019re not \u2013 we\u2019re not talking about the \u2013 i\u2019m assuming there might be the [town c newspaper] or something like that. there might be a small media enterprise making publications. this is a reputable \u2013 large reputable organisation that has done an investigation and produced a report and there are recordings. so on the face of it, it is a matter \u2013 that they are matters that are worthy of some explanation. and what explanation have you been given? it\u2019s totally unsatisfactory. his honour: sorry, an explanation about what? mr duane: well, if \u2013 so one might expect that if the single expert was not the person referred to the \u2013 in the article they could simply say so rather than all of what you heard. his honour: well, you\u2019ve kind of \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mr duane: and \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mentioned it a number of times so i\u2019ve got that point. mr duane: all right. i will try not to be any more repetitive. his honour: and i\u2019m trying to \u2013 and i understand better than i do at the moment there is what i will call the basis of what you would say \u2013 please correct me if i\u2019m wrong. the non-responsive answers, in your view, of [dr b]. yes? mr duane: yes. his honour: and that\u2019s non-responsiveness in relation to \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 mr duane: the article. his honour: sorry, is it sufficient if i just call it the abc article? mr duane: yes. his honour: is \u2013 that was the site that it was on, yes? mr duane: yes. his honour: right. the abc article. and then there\u2019s \u2013 the other ground that i\u2019m hearing for the first time that you and/or your client have issues about the process of the interviews involving at least the mother, yes? mr duane: yes. it\u2019s the conclusions \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: and \u2013 sorry. mr duane: and the conclusions that are reached in the report. his honour: yes, yes. but these are more, sort of, standard questions about reports and, therefore, you know, the dasreef v hawchar issues about the basis of the opinion reached. the reasoning process and the evidence and the sort of link between the \u2013 so that\u2019s another arm of the application, is it? mr duane: well, it just goes to that aspect so i think you \u2013 it is said of me that i haven\u2019t said any \u2013 made any criticisms about the report or said anything that\u2019s in issue or that flows from this. there are two primary factual, sort of, broad descriptions that are very much in issue. one is the conclusion that it was manipulative to go to brisbane and the second is that the mother will not comply with court orders. will not foster relationship with \u2013 between the children and their father if they are in brisbane. and the nature of the material in the article would give rise to concerns about whether you would accept where that is challenged, the expert\u2019s opinion over the \u2013 over the sworn testimony of the parties. the contents of the report are so troubling that they call into question the whole of the process. his honour: is any of this in the case outline or any of the mother\u2019s material? mr duane: no, because i did not know about this until last night. his honour: i\u2019m just trying to \u2013 i\u2019m just trying to understand can you take me to any paragraph in the case outline that deals with concerns, issues about the family report? sorry, about the expert report either as to process to conclusion. mr duane: well, no, i can\u2019t. i will just take that on notice but i don\u2019t think there is a question that directly deals with those things. his honour: well, certainly. yes. i don\u2019t \u2013 i don\u2019t recall there being any such issue raised. mr duane: no, but it\u2019s not uncommon for there to be \u2013 i\u2019m not sure that it was \u2013 it\u2019s not uncommon for there to be a case which develops and for it to be clear that there is a \u2013 this amount of evidence about this particular topic. there were these various opinions that were expressed in the report. at the end of hearing all the evidence you should accept the parties\u2019 evidence rather than the conclusion in the family report. there\u2019s so much in a family report and i certainly would contend that the central components of the family report were in issue. the mother certainly doesn\u2019t \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: just that there won\u2019t \u2013 but they won\u2019t articulate it. mr duane: well, it could have been better articulated, your honour. his honour: no, not just better. just done. just to give notice to everyone this is the case that everyone is having to deal with including the court. i wasn\u2019t aware of any and maybe i missed it when i was going through all this on \u2013 over the weekend but i didn\u2019t \u2013 and i raised with you yesterday morning \u2013 was it only yesterday morning? mr duane: it must be an enjoyable process. his honour: i will get a bucket for my joy. that \u2013 sorry, respectfully. that i raised with you what the cornerstones of the mother\u2019s case were. mr duane: yes. his honour: and you kindly and delicately, as you always do, you know, doing that or, you know, there\u2019s this issue, there\u2019s this issue and this issue and i don\u2019t recall anything. we will obviously check it on the transcript. mr duane: no, there\u2019s no issue. i didn\u2019t say the family report process was flawed in the \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: or the report itself. mr duane: but i wasn\u2019t addressing you about the family report. i was just addressing you about what the mother\u2019s case is. the consequence of that is that you know my case was genuine, if na\u00efve, move to brisbane that must have called into question the family report writer\u2019s opinion to the contrary. his honour: why? mr duane: because she says it was a manipulative move. his honour: yes, but every expert that\u2019s what they\u2019re paid to do is to do an assessment, make recommendations, whatever. i mean the court obviously is not bound by whatever any expert says but just because says, well, really this is my view \u2013 this is what the expert\u2019s view is, therefore, that one \u2013 you know, houston we have a problem. well, yes. mr duane: well, it has only really come about because of the knowledge that has come about subsequently. one wouldn\u2019t jump to conclusions about inadequacy of experts without the sort of things that are dealt with in the article. his honour: the benefit of the 2020, you know, rear view mirror now we understand the problem. mr duane: well, specifically in relation to the expert. prior to that one just might leave the topic quietly alone and at the end point to the lack of evidence in support of the conclusion. the abc article in question does not relate to the current matter before the court, (b) nobody suggests that any of the parties in the current matter went to or received any therapy from dr b, and (c) neither of the parties in the current matter made any complaints that are the subject of the abc article. nobody suggests that any of the parties in the current matter went to or received any therapy from dr b, and (c) neither of the parties in the current matter made any complaints that are the subject of the abc article. neither of the parties in the current matter made any complaints that are the subject of the abc article. mr duane: no, the questions \u2013 there are questions as to competency that are raised in the article and \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: so you\u2019re wanting me to draw a direct link between the article and unidentified parties, etcetera, and this matter? mr duane: yes, because the expert refused to do the simple task of saying that\u2019s not me in the article. his honour: right. so is that ... ground one or are there other grounds? ... mr duane: so that the contents of the article raise questions as to whether the witness will bring impartiality and independence or objectivity to the process but because of what is alleged to have occurred in the article. so the contents \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: would you accept though that every report by any expert is going to favour, to some degree \u2013 and it\u2019s only a question of degree \u2013 pardon me \u2013 one side or the other? mr duane: there\u2019s no doubt about that. all one can hope for is that there will be impartiality and the appearance of it prior to entry into the task and that the person who is given that task has that appearance. now, if there are fundamental questions about their capacity to do so on that score by reason of things that have happened in another matter or are alleged to have happened that are not possible to engage in because of the way the witness answered questions. then they go to the heart of what is necessary from an expert aside from competence. his honour: it just seems \u2013 can i just say it just seems curious \u2013 i will put it as neutrally as i can \u2013 the basis for submissions. hence, my earlier questions before the short break of like you only found out about this article last evening at some stage. someone obviously had been doing some digging some time beforehand but i\u2019ve got no information about when or how that was done or by whom. mr duane: well \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: correct? mr duane: yes. that\u2019s right. so, you know, that process it\u2019s important to differentiate between gossip and evidence and until today there has not been evidence. so until questions were asked all that there was was whether or not what i needed to satisfy myself of was \u2013 there was a reasonable basis for making an inquiry. and the inquiry was put in very particular terms. so it is quite important to have a proper basis for these sorts of applications which is what a lot of \u2013 between yesterday and this morning was concerned with is that question but it having arisen and the course that the evidence has taken that one \u2013 no step could have been taken to remove the expert until the expert gave an answer to the question. no step could have been taken because that would have just been based on hearsay, gossip. however you want to describe it. pretty good gossip or pretty well sourced gossip, one might say, but, nonetheless, not evidence. so it wasn\u2019t possible to take the step prior to today but having done so critical issues concerning competence and objectivity and ethical behaviour generally are the three essential core bases for there being a lack of capacity to continue to perform this extremely important job. his honour: but no questions raised about the report process, whatever, has been raised until this afternoon. correct? mr duane: yes, that\u2019s quite right. so there will be the normal cross-examination but really this is quite different to that. mr duane: so really that will be the background. once you read the article you will be in a position to consider whether you\u2019re troubled about the central matters that are necessary for an expert to discharge their function. his honour: and you say that it\u2019s imperative that i read the article for the purposes of this application? mr duane: yes, and we\u2019ve, i think, flagged this as being on the voir dire so, you know, it\u2019s \u2013 so there isn\u2019t \u2013 shouldn\u2019t be any difficulty taking that evidence in for that purpose or that has been received, in any event. and the other last aspect is that the sub (3) of the expert witness\u2019 duties really is \u2013 at paragraph (e) is asking the expert to tell the court \u2013 and it lists some named things but (ii), in particular: if the expert witness believes the report prepared by the witness may be inaccurate for any other reason. now, it would be my submission that the expert ought to inform the court where there are serious professional conduct complaints made about them of substance. sorry, serious professional complaints made about them. when i say \u201cof substance\u201d i mean going to their capacity to be an expert witness. i don\u2019t mean that the report writer was biased because they ought made a recommendation in favour of the other party but these are issues that when you look at the article they go far beyond that and deal with competence and ethical matters. that\u2019s it from me. his honour: no, but how \u2013 sorry to interrupt but how did you draw a link between [dr b] and whatever is in this report or this media story? mr duane: well, that probably doesn\u2019t matter. your honour knows \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: well, i would have thought it does submissions: counsel for the father ...returning to the question, however, of the discharge of the expert. the application must necessarily only be on the basis of the media article because although it feels much longer when we were here yesterday there was no objection to the receipt of the reports. there was no challenge made to the receiving of the report. there was no challenge made to the professionalism, to the skills or expertise of the expert. what the court is, therefore, left with is a media article. a media article which may or may not have resulted in professional \u2013 complaints to professional bodies but one thing we can be certain of it hasn\u2019t resulted and it may never result in findings being made by a professional body. his honour: against whoever was involved. ms dart: against whoever was involved. so your honour needs to assume for the purpose of the article \u2013 for the \u2013 sorry, the purpose of the application that the person referred to in the article is [dr b]. secondly, you need to assume that the contents of the article are true and correct and fulsome. and, in my submission, the court would approach that with extreme caution. there has been no inquiry, no review of which we\u2019re aware of the allegations that have been raised in appropriate \u2013 before an appropriate court or tribunal. it is a long bow, in my submission, to say because [dr b] didn\u2019t deny it was her and because her evidence, on one view, may have been unsatisfactory you, therefore, conclude that she\u2019s in the article \u2013 the topic of the article. you, therefore, conclude that the contents of the article itself are true. i don\u2019t step away from the fact that issues raised in that article are matters of concern and the court has acknowledged that in the media release. but how does it relate to the report in this matter if nobody has come to the court and the mother hasn\u2019t in her affidavit material or by way of orders sought or submissions made raised concern about the manner in which it was conducted? the mother doesn\u2019t say that [dr b] was inappropriate in her engagement with her. she doesn\u2019t say that [dr b] made threats. she doesn\u2019t say that [dr b] directed her to act in a certain way or otherwise or that she in any way acted less than professionally. so what we\u2019re left with is the mother who is unhappy with the report. on the heel of the hunt finds out information that may be able to assist her and grabs and attempts to run with it. but, as i say, with some fundamental flaws in the argument that your honour can\u2019t make a finding that [dr b] was the author of \u2013 was the subject matter of the report. and your honour cannot make a finding that the contents of that article are true and correct and completely frank. and, in my submission, there is no other basis which is advanced which would suggest that your honour would discharge the expert. your honour has been referred to requirements under the rules. it cannot be said that any of those requirements would expect a expert to disclose to the court if they had been the subject of adverse complaints to a professional body absent findings of professional conduct having been made. there could be no requirement that is inferred by those rules that an expert would need to come to the court and disclose that they are the subject of a media article or they\u2019re the subject of a facebook post or they\u2019re the subject of a social media campaign. how does that fall squarely within the duty of the experts to the court? in my submission, it doesn\u2019t. the court cannot draw an inference that there has been bias on the part of the expert in the circumstance in which she conducted the assessment in this matter to which no complaint is made that would lead to the discharge of the report. it remains unclear as to the precise nature in which the application is made. the application appears to be by reference to the professional rules and an inference that there has been \u2013 sorry, the expert code of conduct and that there has been a breach of that duty of the court to be inferred from the media article. and, as i say, your honour identified at the beginning of the matter this appears to be trial by media and that\u2019s what\u2019s you\u2019re asking to do. on the basis of a media article that might be [dr b], might be somebody else, form the conclusion she\u2019s not a fit and proper person to perform the role of an expert in the circumstances of this case absent anything more. and, in my submission, absent anything more the application must be refused. they\u2019re my submissions. his honour: sorry, did you wish to say anything about what i will call the other so-called limb? namely, that in terms of \u2013 i mean you already mentioned this earlier on about there\u2019s no complaint in the mother\u2019s material, either affidavit or case outline, about the process during the report or what\u2019s in the report and there was no objection taken when i asked yesterday morning about its submission. so in terms of what i\u2019ve said in a shorthand way about the dasreef v hawchar issues did you wish to say anything about those? ms dart: yes, your honour. i will say this briefly. your honour was taken to two issues in which that contention is made. it\u2019s in relation to the conclusion by [dr b] that the mother was manipulative in her move. and, secondly, that the mother wouldn\u2019t comply with orders of the court. and in the totality of the report that is in excess of 30 pages they\u2019re the complaints that have been made and they\u2019re matters could and should \u2013 and if the matter continues would be properly put to [dr b] during cross-examination. if that is the thrust of the complaint though in order to expedite those issues i wouldn\u2019t be heard against those two statements being excised from the report. it\u2019s not a concession that they\u2019re inaccurate but in terms of the evidence that your honour has heard thus far and what you need to determine those two statements, i say, are not going to be determinative of your honour\u2019s determination, in any event. submissions: the icl ms cruise: it may be. it may be that i am just not part of whatever has been circulating. so i agree that there is, essentially, very little, if any, nexus between that article and what is raised and the expert evidence that [dr b] has given in these proceedings. and, certainly, nothing has been raised with me before now as to any concerns that arose out of her conducting her interviews including with the children. more significantly, there are two children the subject of these proceedings who cannot be left in the situation in which they find themselves now. they are not effectively supported in relation to very significant concerns about their mental health. they are the subject of intense and ongoing conflict which i cannot see abating in any way and certainly hasn\u2019t before today. and it is my very firm position that your honour must make a determination about what happens for them. one of the very significant concerns that i have is that if it\u2019s the case that this matter cannot conclude in the very near future, or cannot conclude with your honour, it may be delayed, and the children may be another year older than they are now which is a year older than they were when [dr b] met with them. it may be at that time, the court, whoever it is, is presented with an argument that their ages now mean their wishes are determinative, and i think that is a very significant concern. and i\u2019m not going to suggest that it\u2019s a why reason why this has occurred, but it has to be a concern for me as the children\u2019s lawyer. if your honour makes a decision to take the report out of contention in these proceedings, i also agree that your honour has sufficient evidence to make a decision as to what should happen. and i absolutely am convinced and submit to the court that a decision now or in the very near future is in the best interests of both of the children for whom i act. please the court. submissions in reply \u2013 the mother the operation of s.121 of the act in the circumstances of the current matter and the claims made by the mother against the expert, and dr b\u2019s responses, (b) dr b\u2019s \u201cprotection\u201d against the mother\u2019s claims arising from the abc article

article provided, etc.). what prompted the mother\u2019s legal representative(s) to make inquiries about the abc article (e.g. by whom, when, how)? please outline the sequence of events (noting the persons involved and the time-line) that led the mother\u2019s legal team to make the application for [dr b\u2019s] discharge. was the mother\u2019s legal representative aware of the article prior to the commencement of the trial? if so, when, by whom, and by what means, did the mother\u2019s legal representative(s) become aware of the abc article? was the belief held prior to the commencement of the trial that the article referred to [dr b]? what was the evidentiary basis for the belief that the abc article referred to [dr b]? was it suspicion, opinion (if so, what, where and by whom)? when was this belief formed? were instructions sought and obtained from the mother prior to any inquiries into the abc article? if so, when, how and by whom. is it accepted by the mother\u2019s legal representatives that (a) there has been no \u201cfollow-up\u201d article from the abc (or by anyone else) regarding the original abc article in june 2023, and (b) to the best of everyone\u2019s knowledge and belief, there has been no disciplinary or other proceeding against [dr b], directly or indirectly, as a result of the abc article or otherwise? we continue to act for the respondent mother in the above matter and thank you for providing the orders made by his honour on 29 august 2023. we apologise for the lateness of this correspondence. we appreciate his honour's comments in relation to the court's desire to deal with this application as expeditiously and appropriately as possible. in providing our response we endeavour to be similarly respectful and keep these objectives at the forefront. we enclose an application in a case in which the mother seeks that the orders made by his honour be vacated in circumstances where the parties have not been provided the opportunity to be heard in relation to the making of such orders. we enclose submissions in support of this application. if, despite the above, his honour determines that the orders should remain in force, we seek that the orders be stayed to enable our client's application to discharge the orders to be properly heard. we confirm that any orders, if not stayed or discharged, will be complied with. everything that has transpired since approximately lunch time on day two of the trial has been a direct result of the actions of either (or both) the mother and her legal representatives, (b) it is only the mother who has made applications \u2013 one oral and one foreshadowed in writing. no one else has done so. as night follows day, as a matter of fact and of logic, because only one person has initiated applications, everyone else (including the court) can only be \u201cresponders\u201d to them. the father, the icl, and the court, cannot ignore applications, there can only be responses to them. it also follows that if any responsibility for any delay, possible \u201coppression\u201d, or cost arises, subject to submissions and the exercise of discretion, it can only lay at the feet of the mother and/or her lawyer, and (c) one of the more remarkable aspects of events since the adjournment of the trial to enable the court to deal with the mother\u2019s oral application is that, notwithstanding the orders of 29th august 2023 stated that \u201cthe mother\u2019s legal representative\u201d was to provide an affidavit to confirm answers to the six questions set out in those orders, the responses came (a) in the form of a yet to be filed application seeking to set aside the questions, and (b) submissions were provided but which were stated to be filed on behalf of the mother and not by the mother\u2019s legal representative. put another way: the court directed a legal practitioner to do certain things. that practitioner did not do so. as such, this was direct disobedience or defiance of a court order by a legal practitioner. to state the obvious: this places everyone in a very difficult and delicate situation. it is only the mother who has made

out by the high court in mann v carnell.[40] at [29] in that case, the plurality of the court (gleeson cj, gaudron, gummow and callinan jj) (kirby j agreeing at [155]) said: waiver may be express or implied. disputes as to implied waiver usually arise from the need to decide whether particular conduct is inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. ... what brings about the waiver is the inconsistency, which the courts, where necessary informed by considerations of fairness, perceive, between the conduct of the client and maintenance of the confidentiality, not some overriding principle of fairness operating at large. more recently, in expense reduction analysts group pty ltd v armstrong strategic management and marketing pty ltd, the high court discussed the principle of \u201cwaiver\u201d in the context of a claim for privilege in relation to certain documents.[41] at [30] and [31] the court said (internal citations omitted): ] according to its strict legal connotation, waiver is an intentional act done with knowledge whereby a person abandons a right (or privilege) by acting in a manner inconsistent with that right (or privilege). it may be express or implied. in most cases concerning waiver, the area of dispute is whether it is to be implied. in some cases waiver will be imputed by the law with the consequence that a privilege is lost, even though that consequence was not intended by the party losing the privilege. the courts will impute an intention where the actions of a party are plainly inconsistent with the maintenance of the confidentiality which the privilege is intended to protect. [31] in craine v colonial mutual fire insurance co ltd, it was explained that \"'[w]aiver' is a doctrine of some arbitrariness introduced by the law to prevent a man in certain circumstances from taking up two inconsistent positions ... it is a conclusion of law when the necessary facts are established. it looks, however, chiefly to the conduct and position of the person who is said to have waived, in order to see whether he has 'approbated' so as to prevent him from 'reprobating'\"... here, during the extensive submissions by counsel for the mother in relation to what i will call her primary (oral) application to discharge the expert, no question of privilege was ever raised by counsel, including when asked questions by the court regarding the matters noted above in relation to the timing of the \u201cdiscovery\u201d of the abc article (and by whom), and in consequence matters going to delay. in the light of having had the opportunity to raise any issues, for example, regarding privilege during the hearing of that application and not doing so, the mother (or her solicitor) cannot now, after the event, change their position(s) and seek to claim, especially in the most general terms outlined, a general claim for privilege. (d) indeed, the generality of the claim for privilege also militates against it having any applicability here. among many authorities in this regard, in kennedy v wallace, the full federal court (black cj and emmett j) said, at [13]:[42] indeed, the generality of the claim for privilege also militates against it having any applicability here. among many authorities in this regard, in kennedy v wallace, the full federal court (black cj and emmett j) said, at [13]:[42] ... it is not sufficient for a party merely to assert a claim for privilege nor will an affidavit asserting the purpose for which a document was brought into existence ... be sufficient. ... privilege is [not] \u201cnecessarily or conclusively established by resort to any formula or ritual ... whatever the facts may be, it is always for the party claiming privilege to show that the documents for which the claim is made are in fact privileged. just so here: the onus was and remains upon the mother (and her solicitor) to make good the claim for privilege. as an observation at this stage, and in addition to what has already been stated, simply asking about specific times and persons cannot, without much more, reasonably attract any privilege. the questions during counsel\u2019s submissions, and as sought in the interrogatories, seek no information regarding legal advice. even a discussion \u201cbetween solicitors\u201d about a publicly available article, cannot, without more, attract privilege. it may be that discussions about what to do with the article for the purposes of the current litigation might attract some privilege. however, in the absence of any affidavit from anyone on the mother\u2019s side, it is simply impossible to make any proper judgment, or claim for privilege. certainly, there is no compliance by the mother or her solicitor with the authorities listed above. outline of principle a.5. confidentiality a.5.1. psychologists safeguard the confidentiality of information

[63] i also observe that notwithstanding her grievances with psychologist a, which are set out in detail in her trial affidavit, the mother elected not to put any clarifying questions to psychologist a at the time of publication of her primary report, nor did she bring an application for psychologist a's discharge. [64] further, in her trial affidavit, the mother relies on certain aspects of psychologist a's report which are critical of the father. litigants cannot have it both ways: one cannot simultaneously rely upon the critiques of the other party and seek to discharge the report in its entirety. [65] the complexion of the mother's complaints against psychologist a only take on a more concerning tone following the publication of the abc article about \"dr julie\". i am left to wonder why, if the mother held these specific and more serious concerns about psychologist a's conduct prior to her becoming aware of the abc article, they were not set out in her trial affidavit, which was filed on 28 april 2023, which as i have already observed, otherwise comprehensively set out her views of psychologist a's method and report. [66] for the parties' benefit, i read the abc article and listened to the associated podcast at the time they were published, as i would any news reporting that relates to family court issues. i agree the report raises serious concern about the alleged conduct of the subject psychologist.71 i do not in any way seek to minimise or trivialise those concerns. however, i offer the following comments about the abc article: [67] first, i do not know whether the subject psychologist provided her consent to be recorded, which may give rise to an argument about the legality of the recording. [68] second, it is apparent that only short soundbites from the recordings were used for the purpose of the abc article. accordingly, i have no context for those aspects of the recordings that were included in the podcast and article, nor do i know whether the recordings were edited in any way for impact or effect. [69] third, i do not know whether the subject psychologist has obtained legal advice about the abc article or any remedies that person may have available to them, if any. the answer to this question may impact on them commenting on the abc article in part or in its entirety. 7[0] fourth, the subject psychologist was conducting family therapy outside of the family court process, which is distinctly different to the role psychologist a has been appointed to undertake in these proceedings, in which she is the court appointed single expert witness.72 this appointment carries with it an obligation to discharge her responsibilities in a manner consistent with the rules, the australian standards of practice for family assessments and reporting73 together with her professional obligations arising pursuant to the australian psychological society code of ethics. [71] to the best of my knowledge, and on the evidence before the court, the allegations made against the psychologist the subject of the abc article are currently allegations only. the subject psychologist may have a complaint or multiple complaints made against them with ahpra. however, that person is entitled to due process. they have a right to respond to those complaints in a manner that is procedurally fair to the complainants but also to the psychologist themselves: procedural fairness is not the sole purview of one party. [72] it may be argued that a family court report writer holds a unique and powerful position within a family court case. this is true to an extent, but proceedings are not determined by single expert witness reports alone.[49] as important as a single expert witness might be to a proceedings, they may be no more or less important than parties having access to competent and experienced counsel, who are in many ways, equally as invaluable to the court. [73] the sad reality is that family court proceedings are often complex because we deal with highly emotive situations, often with traumatised parents and children, with complex family dynamics. when i was in practice and was involved with the legal practice board through my appointment as senior counsel, i understood the legal practice board received a large volume of complaints about family law professionals. the proper administration of justice may significantly be impacted in this court if solicitors or counsel were precluded from acting where they had unresolved complaints made about them at the legal practice complaints committee (\"the lpcc\"). [74] this court does not require solicitors or counsel to disclose to this court when complaints are made about them to the lpcc nor in respect to the status of any such complaint, it is the outcome of said complaints, or where interim restrictions are put in place pending the finalisation of a complaint that are of significance. [75] to be clear, i strongly believe people should have a right to make a complaint to a professional's regulatory body, it maintains accountability and should serve to enhance the public's confidence in the profession and the family law system more broadly. [76] however, it appears to me that it would be manifestly unjust to restrict a family law professional, be it a single expert witness or a legal practitioner, who appears regularly before this court from working in their chosen profession in circumstances where any complaints made against them had not been finalised, particularly where this court does not know if that individual has been afforded procedural fairness or exhausted any legal remedies that may be available to them in respect to the complaint. [77] based on the evidence provided by the icl, there is no legal impediment to psychologist a practicing as a psychologist. if that changes, i have every confidence that psychologist a would notify this court promptly. [78] i do not consider it the role of this court to use these proceedings to unearth the identify of \"dr julie\". that issue is appropriately left to the relevant regulatory body, and should it come to it, the relevant disciplinary tribunal. [79] my job, as is the job of every other judicial officer in this court, is to focus on the specific proceedings before it, and deal with the facts and circumstances that are in issue in those proceedings. in this particular case, it is also to ensure an expeditious trial given the mental health concerns raised about the children. [80] i do not consider that the interests of justice will be compromised if i do not accede to the mother's application. whilst the mother has, only after the publication of the abc article, raised more serious concerns about psychologist a's conduct, there is no: suggestion that psychologist a has failed to discharge her duties in accordance with the orders made by the court, (b) dispute about her experience, or her expertise nor is there any claim, supported by the evidence currently before the court, that psychologist a has acted in a biased manner or in a way which is reasonably likely to have created an apprehension of bias, and (c) there is no assertion of any substantial body of opinion contrary to any opinions espoused by psychologist a, or that a contrary opinion may be necessary for determining the issues in dispute, or that there may be matters not known to psychologist a, which are necessary to determine the issues in dispute. dispute about her experience, or her expertise nor is there any claim, supported by the evidence currently before the court, that psychologist a has acted in a biased manner or in a way which is reasonably likely to have created an apprehension of bias, and (c) there is no assertion of any substantial body of opinion contrary to any opinions espoused by psychologist a, or that a contrary opinion may be necessary for determining the issues in dispute, or that there may be matters not known to psychologist a, which are necessary to determine the issues in dispute. there is no assertion of any substantial body of opinion contrary to any opinions espoused by psychologist a, or that a contrary opinion may be necessary for determining the issues in dispute, or that there may be matters not known to psychologist a, which are necessary to determine the issues in dispute. ] further, i do not consider the mother will be prejudiced if i do not make orders as sought by her. in fact, with the trial some few weeks away, i consider the parties and the children more likely to be adversely prejudiced if i were to make an order discharging psychologist a, as that is likely to result in the trial being vacated so that the parties, the icl and the court can consider whether a further single expert witness should be appointed. [82] i have not lost sight of the mother's complaints about psychologist a, or how the abc article would have impacted any parent involved in family court proceedings where a single expert witness has been appointed. however, all of the mother's allegations can be properly put to psychologist a during cross-examination. i will then be in an informed position to make findings about psychologist a's evidence, including if necessary, her conduct in these proceedings, which is my concern. the impact of those findings will self-evidently inform what weight i consider should be placed on her report and her evidence more broadly. further, if this court has concern about psychologist a's conduct following the conclusion of the evidence, appropriate consequences may follow, which include allowing one or both parties to make a complaint to ahpra themselves, or in fact, making such a referral itself. consideration and disposition the mother seeks to have the court draw some relevant nexus between the anonymised therapist referred to in the abc article and dr b. in part, this was on the basis that it was, somehow, \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d that she was the therapist referred to in the article, accepting that counsel for the mother did not have this \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d himself until the evening before the application was made, and that the court and the icl were similarly ignorant about it, and remained completely ignorant of it until the application was raised after lunch on the second day of the trial, and (b) the mother also seeks that the court draw an adverse inference against dr b (i) for not directly denying (or perhaps \u201cnot admitting\u201d) that she is the therapist referred to in the abc article, and in turn, (ii) because she referred to various legal grounds that prevented her from answering such questions (e.g. s.121 of the act, the principle of \u201cconfidentiality\u201d), and (c) it may be generally inferred also that, in some not fully articulated way, there has not been complete compliance by dr b with certain parts of rule 7.18 of this court\u2019s rules. the mother also seeks that the court draw an adverse inference against dr b (i) for not directly denying (or perhaps \u201cnot admitting\u201d) that she is the therapist referred to in the abc article, and in turn, (ii) because she referred to various legal grounds that prevented her from answering such questions (e.g. s.121 of the act, the principle of \u201cconfidentiality\u201d), and (c) it may be generally inferred also that, in some not fully articulated way, there has not been complete compliance by dr b with certain parts of rule 7.18 of this court\u2019s rules. it may be generally inferred also that, in some not fully articulated way, there has not been complete compliance by dr b with certain parts of rule 7.18 of this court\u2019s rules. by posing the simple question \u2013 \u201cwhat if the abc is wrong\u201d, and/or \u201cwhat if the mother is wrong\u201d \u2013 about the inference to be drawn from an anonymised article, exposes to a significant degree, the obvious difficulty for the mother in relying upon an inference (her \u201cbest evidence\u201d) which is both contestable and otherwise unable to be established on the balance of probabilities, or at all. it is a simple statement of long-held principle that courts operate and decide matters on facts that are plainly established. the burden is upon the mother to establish the formal nexus between the anonymised person\u00e6 in the abc article and dr b. in my view, it is impossible to establish that nexus. such nexus cannot be established on the basis of the extremely flimsy evidence, and unsupported assertions (e.g. so-called \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d), propounded here, (b) counsel for the mother even conceded (noted above) that, until dr b\u2019s evidence, there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to link dr b with the abc article. given that there was neither denial nor confirmation by dr b but rather a range of reasonable claims available to her, how that link was made after her evidence, and in the face of it, was never explained. it effectively became something of a mantra as the foundation for the application, namely, the inference that \u201cit must be her because she [dr b] did not deny it was her.\u201d this is rather like the old story of taking it as an admission when a person is asked whether \u201cyou have stopped beating your partner\u201d. any answer to such a question damns the person immediately, (c) thus, at its highest, the mother was seeking to have the court draw an adverse inference against dr b, and further, that there should be a formal finding that the un-named therapist referred to in the article was, in fact, dr b. again, how one makes the leap of faith from the anonymised article and the anonymised person\u00e6 referred to in it, to dr b, was not relevantly explained. respectfully, in the absence of actual evidence, rather than some inference involving anonymous protagonists, this and other arguments discussed below, came awfully close to the notorious \u201cvibe\u201d submission from the iconic australian film, the castle, (d) the so-called \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d contention used to attempt to draw (or to bolster) some further or related inference against dr b must also fail, and not only because counsel did not know of this \u201ccommon knowledge\u201d until the night before the application \u2013 and the court and the icl likewise. it must also fail because there was no compliance with, or reference to, s.144 of the evidence act, which deals with \u201cmatters of common knowledge.\u201d if a party proposes to refer to such matters, there must be compliance with the evidence act. this did not occur here at all, (e) the contention that the court should somehow draw some further (or to bolster) adverse inference because dr b chose not to respond as counsel for the mother wished was both novel and troubling. it was as if this expert, or indeed any witness, must be denied any protection available to them. it would be a complete inversion of both process and substance if possible or otherwise common and available \u201cdefences\u201d (to speak in general terms) were to be denied to any witness, expert or not. it would be even more perverse to argue, as the mother did here, that reliance upon a range of statutory (i.e. s.121 of the act) and other \u201cprotections\u201d (e.g. the ethical principle of \u201cconfidentiality\u201d set out in the guidelines issued by the australian psychology association) should be used as some form of \u201cadmission\u201d, but only by inference, to support the mother\u2019s claim. on the mother\u2019s case, any inference, or complaint, without any proper process or finding, or disciplinary action by an appropriate body, is sufficient to require the discharge of an expert against whose reports there is no formal challenge, (f) each of the completely flawed arguments outlined, and dismissed or refuted, above must also be understood in the crucial context where (i) in her trial affidavit, the mother did not raise a single issue about dr b\u2019s reports, either as to process, language or conclusion/recommendations, and (ii) both of dr b\u2019s reports were admitted into evidence on the first day of the trial without any expression of concern, or any opposition. in the face of the conduct of the mother (i.e her legal \u201cteam\u201d) at the trial in these respects, and then, in the face of that conduct, run the oral application (without leave) to discharge the expert on the basis of some inference that \u201cshould\u201d be drawn from anonymised protagonists, showed how impoverished, if not frail and brittle, the evidence relied upon was, (g) the concerns and criticisms expressed by cohen j in jenkins & grothe at [67] \u2013 [77], set out above, apply with equal force, gravity and concern here, (h) it is not the role of this court to act as some sort of disciplinary or regulatory tribunal of experts. still less is it the role of this court to pre-empt any regulatory or disciplinary body, in the event that such a course unfolds regarding any expert. any expert will usually and ordinarily be subject to proper process to investigate any complaint, including a proper opportunity to be heard and to raise any relevant defence. again i stress the important distinction between \u201ccomplaint\u201d and \u201cfinding\u201d from a disciplinary or regulatory body. if the court was to act upon the abc article here as urged by the mother, leaving to one side the lack of evidence regarding any possible editing of recordings referred to and used in the article (as well as the possible illegality of the recording), it would lower the bar to an almost non-existent or unintelligible level. as propounded by the mother, an inference (not even a complaint) from an anonymised article will be sufficient to discharge an expert. no court could seriously countenance such a course. and as the cases from western australia point out, it is not unheard of for complaints to be made against lawyers. there is no requirement for any such complaints to be made to a court before any appearance. a complaint, by definition, does not necessarily lead to some finding of negligence, or worse, and (i) at perhaps the most basic procedural level, there was never any leave sought either (a) to dispense with the rules regarding the filing of an application in a proceeding, and or (b) to proceed with an oral application without either a formalised application and or supporting affidavit. under the rules (e.g. 1.33), failure to comply with the rules can lead to the matter being dismissed, either in part or in whole. the application before the court was breath-taking in its failure to provide the most basic information, which remains outstanding. it was no less remarkable because it presumed upon the court permitting it to proceeding, without even seeking leave to proceed. to be fair, counsel for the mother noted that the application was subject to any other direction of the court, but there remained no application or leave to proceed. counsel for the mother even conceded (noted above) that, until dr b\u2019s evidence, there was \u201cno evidence\u201d to link dr b

reference to, s.144 of the evidence act, which deals with \u201cmatters of common knowledge.\u201d if a party proposes to refer to such matters, there must be compliance with the evidence act. this did not occur here at all, (e) the contention that the court should somehow draw some further (or to bolster) adverse inference because dr b chose not to respond as counsel for the mother wished was both novel and troubling. it was as if this expert, or indeed any witness, must be denied any protection available to them. it would be a complete inversion of both process and substance if possible or otherwise common and available \u201cdefences\u201d (to speak in general terms) were to be denied to any witness, expert or not. it would be even more perverse to argue, as the mother did here, that reliance upon a range of statutory (i.e. s.121 of the act) and other \u201cprotections\u201d (e.g. the ethical principle of \u201cconfidentiality\u201d set out in the guidelines issued by the australian psychology association) should be used as some form of \u201cadmission\u201d, but only by inference, to support the mother\u2019s claim. on the mother\u2019s case, any inference, or complaint, without any proper process or finding, or disciplinary action by an appropriate body, is sufficient to require the discharge of an expert against whose reports there is no formal challenge, (f) each of the completely flawed arguments outlined, and dismissed or refuted, above must also be understood in the crucial context where (i) in her trial affidavit, the mother did not raise a single issue about dr b\u2019s reports, either as to process, language or conclusion/recommendations, and (ii) both of dr b\u2019s reports were admitted into evidence on the first day of the trial without any expression of concern, or any opposition. in the face of the conduct of the mother (i.e her legal \u201cteam\u201d) at the trial in these respects, and then, in the face of that conduct, run the oral application (without leave) to discharge the expert on the basis of some inference that \u201cshould\u201d be drawn from anonymised protagonists, showed how impoverished, if not frail and brittle, the evidence relied upon was, (g) the concerns and criticisms expressed by cohen j in jenkins & grothe at [67] \u2013 [77], set out above, apply with equal force, gravity and concern here, (h) it is not the role of this court to act as some sort of disciplinary or regulatory tribunal of experts. still less is it the role of this court to pre-empt any regulatory or disciplinary body, in the event that such a course unfolds regarding any expert. any expert will usually and ordinarily be subject to proper process to investigate any complaint, including a proper opportunity to be heard and to raise any relevant defence. again i stress the important distinction between \u201ccomplaint\u201d and \u201cfinding\u201d from a disciplinary or regulatory body. if the court was to act upon the abc article here as urged by the mother, leaving to one side the lack of evidence regarding any possible editing of recordings referred to and used in the article (as well as the possible illegality of the recording), it would lower the bar to an almost non-existent or unintelligible level. as propounded by the mother, an inference (not even a complaint) from an anonymised article will be sufficient to discharge an expert. no court could seriously countenance such a course. and as the cases from western australia point out, it is not unheard of for complaints to be made against lawyers. there is no requirement for any such complaints to be made to a court before any appearance. a complaint, by definition, does not necessarily lead to some finding of negligence, or worse, and (i) at perhaps the most basic procedural level, there was never any leave sought either (a) to dispense with the rules regarding the filing of an application in a proceeding, and or (b) to proceed with an oral application without either a formalised application and or supporting affidavit. under the rules (e.g. 1.33), failure to comply with the rules can lead to the matter being dismissed, either in part or in whole. the application before the court was breath-taking in its failure to provide the most basic information, which remains outstanding. it was no less remarkable because it presumed upon the court permitting it to proceeding, without even seeking leave to proceed. to be fair, counsel for the mother noted that the application was subject to any other direction of the court, but there remained no application or leave to proceed. the contention that the court should somehow draw some further (or to bolster) adverse inference because dr b chose not to respond as

\u201ccomplaints\u201d made against them from time to time. there is no requirement that they not be entitled to appear in court and to continue their professional life while-ever there is no relevant finding and disciplinary finding against them that would preclude the continuation of their professional lives. the same general comments apply to other professions, such as medical practitioners, who also reasonably frequently have complaints filed against them. it is only upon a finding by a disciplinary body, and relevantly if and when some sanction is imposed, is there any formal restriction upon their practice.[3] see t 190.[4] t 199.[5] see t 120 \u2013 124.[6] among other places, see generally rr.1.33 and 1.34.[7] the abc article, together with a very brief media release by this court,

inclusive conference memorandum dated 4 november 2021. (c) to explore the possibility and options for the children's reintroduction to their father in a supervised setting in the first instance, if appropriate, as well as dealing with their generalised anxieties. ex temporereasons for judgment judge o\u2019shannessy 1 these are the settled short reasons pursuant to section 69zl of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u2018the act\u2019) on an interim matter and delivered ex tempore. the matters i have to determine are helpfully set out in exhibit d 8.11.2021. the parties or the parents lived together from march 2006 until july 2013 or perhaps january 2014 and nothing turns on that. following separation, mr hackland (\u2018the father\u2019) spent some time with the children, x who is now 11 and y who is now eight (\u2018the children\u2019). ms dymott (\u2018the mother\u2019) deposes that it was because of her fear of the father that she permitted the children to spend time with him. the mother alleges significant family violence and exposure of the children to family violence. in addition to that, it is common ground that the father has, in the past, suffered what can sometimes be called a mental health breakdown or mental health problems and he has undertaken significant treatment for such circumstance. 2 the matter came before a registrar on 15 june 2021 and the parties determined that the matter should be adjourned to this day with a report from a dr b (\u2018dr b\u2019) a clinical psychologist who is an expert in this field and she has prepared a report headed psychosexual risk assessment report. depending whether your glass is half empty or half full, dr b's report is positive or negative. it highlights the difficulties, from a mental health perspective, that the father has had to deal with for a considerable period of time and, essentially, does not recommend that the matter proceed with unsupervised time at this point and diagnoses the father as having a substance abuse disorder: amphetamine and cannabis in sustained remission, severe and she opines that: however, i am of the view he is at high risk of relapse given the stress of his current circumstances and the chronicity of his past use. 3 i add that substantive abuse is not the only issue concerning the father as dr b deals with the common ground of the other mental health issues that the father has wrestled with. 4 exhibit b and exhibit c are hair analysis drug tests and there are two tests. 5 one was undertaken by the father on 19 june 2021 and that test was negative for all substances except cannabis but showed positive low to moderate alcohol consumption. the cannabis reading was 46.3 which is significant as the screening cut off is 10 pg per 10 milligrams. so that test is positive in the sense of showing an abstinence from matters that had previously wreaked havoc in the father\u2019s life including cocaine and amphetamines and showed a low to moderate alcohol consumption, which had also caused the father a lot of problems. 6 it is common ground between counsel, although not stated in the report, that the likely period that that hair follicle test would cover of 19 june would be three months on the basis of the rule of thumb of 1 centimetre of hair covering a month of time. the test undertaken by the father on 4 october 2021 shows negative to all substances including cannabinoids for cannabis or marijuana. the alcohol test showed that the alcohol consumption was low to moderate again but with a different reading and i will not speculate as to the consequences of that. 7 for the mother, ms theoharopoulou has pointed me to the father's observation to dr b that he did not feel like he needed any therapy. however, the order that is before me includes by consent order number 9 which is that the father will seek a referral to and engage in counselling and/or psychological and/or psychiatric treatment as recommended by his medical practitioner and follow all reasonable recommendations as to treatment. 8 ms theoharopoulou submits to me that there are not many positive signs in the circumstances that the father has not yet undertaken or does not have evidence of undertaking counselling or therapy for substance abuse disorder when combined with the seriousness of his substance abuse disorder (now in remission) as described by dr b. 9 these things, to some extent, depend upon whether your glass is half full or half empty. since about march 2021 until now, it is likely that, the father has been abstinent from amphetamines and cocaine and since about july 2021 abstinent from all substances including cannabis. he has continued a low to moderate alcohol consumption and he now having read of some disappointing observations by dr b, he now himself, seeks an order that he be referred to and engage in counselling and/or psychological and psychiatric treatment, as recommended, which is a pretty open book. 10 the father has also been in employment from time to time, is now living with his mother, though largely due to the financial circumstance of the cost of this litigation including the very significant cost of the therapy. they are matters that indicate some very positive rehabilitation on the part of the father. 11 the affidavit of the mother describes serious family violence and being subjected to ongoing family violence and, on her account, threats that would or may have continued post-separation. they are very serious matters. in addition, i have the benefit of the section 11f child inclusive conference memorandum and that describes some anxieties of the children and, in particular, what can be called, (described at paragraph 34), the \u201cbath\u201d or \u201cmr doodle\u201d incident or, on the mother's account in her affidavit, incidents plural. that is denied by the father, and that is acknowledged, but they are serious allegations. 12 the mother presses that the matter be listed for final hearing with no further orders or opportunity for the parties to review the circumstances until final hearing. the state of my list, from matters issued prior to the amalgamation of the two courts, is such that i cannot list this matter for final hearing until january 2023. 13 the father's case was that, as candidly and bluntly put by his counsel, ms mansfield, he has significant work to do but seeks, in the circumstances where he has not seen the children for two plus years, to have the opportunity to ventilate that possibility within about six months or so. in an ideal world, i may be able to provide a final hearing within about six months or eight months or so and i note that the proceedings were issued in april 2021. 14 i also note that the parties had not previously sought that i set the matter down for final hearing but had sought to deal with the matter on an interim basis, including the provision of drug and alcohol testing results by hair follicle tests, the information of an independent assessment of the section 11f child inclusive conference memorandum as well as the referral to dr b. 15 the future directions from the section 11f report released on 4 november 2021 are as follows: in the absence of information to the contrary, the following future directions are provided to the court for consideration 38. mr hackland\u2019s spend time be reserved in the interim. 39. that mr hackland continues to engage in counselling with his current service provider. 40. that x and y commence counselling to support them with the memories they have regarding their father\u2019s alleged inappropriate behaviours and other assessed mental health concerns. 41. the court may benefit from obtaining a psychological report to assess mr hackland\u2019s functioning and safety of the children in relation to them spending time with the father. 42. should the psychological report support spend time between mr hackland and the children, consideration be given to the following steps: 43. psychological support and monitoring remain available for the children until such time that x and y develop enough confidence before telephone calls or professionally supervised spend time is established with mr hackland. 44. consideration be given for the children commencing with telephone conversations with the father before a gradual introduction of professionally supervised spend time occurs. 45. should the children experience undue stress as assessed by the children\u2019s psychologist or counsellor, consideration be given for spend time to be reserved. 46. that the parties enrol and engage in a parenting program to enhance their skills to positively parent the children. an evidence based online service is: triple p: https://www.triplep-parenting.net.au. 47. this memorandum to be made available to the professionals involved with the adults and children. 16 so the remaining issues are as follows. should there be a further interim hearing as pressed for by the father and resisted by the mother. 17 the mother's affidavit and, indeed, paragraph 34 of the child inclusive memorandum asserts matters that can be described as allegations of child abuse. i might add exposure of the children to family violence is also an allegation of exposing the children to family violence and that is an allegation of child abuse. for those reasons, the matter falls within the first category of the decision of re k [1997] famca 21 and it is appropriate and in the children's best interests that they have the assistance of an independent children's lawyer. so that is the first issue in dispute. 18 the context to the next issue is that the parties sensibly have agreed that there be reportable counselling for the children to cover the matters precipitated or triggered by the matters described at paragraph 40 of the section 11f child inclusive conference memorandum and i quote as follows: 40. that x and y commence counselling to support them with the memories they have regarding their father's alleged inappropriate behaviours and other assessed mental health concerns. 19 the dispute was whether or not dr b's report should be provided to the counsellor along with the materials it is agreed that would be provided, which is these orders, the child that i am going to make, the child inclusive memorandum of 4 november 2021, and the mother's affidavit and the father's affidavit. i have determined that the child counsellor should be provided with that affidavit for the context. but the order it should have attached to it at the end words noting that aspects of the report are controversial including the \u201cbath\u201d or \u201cmr doodle\u201d allegations described at 34 of the section 11f child inclusive memorandum and the mother's affidavit. 20 the next dispute between the parties relates to two matters that really run together: whether the father should be provided with current photographs of the children in the circumstances where he has not seen them for two and a half years, and secondly, can the father be permitted to send cards and gifts to the children. ms mansfield makes the point powerfully, that it is clear from the section 11f child inclusive conference memorandum, the interviews being as recent as 28 october 2021, that the children do remember their father or have a memory of their father. from that, ms mansfield raises what is the harm in the father having a photograph of his children that he would very much wish to have? further, it is raised what is the harm in the father being able to send letters, cards and gifts to the children for christmas and birthdays on the basis the parties would seek guidance from the children's counsellor in providing same to the children? and, of course, there is the obvious safeguard that the letters, cards and presents would not be delivered directly to the children but would go to them via the mother and, alternatively, via the independent children\u2019s lawyer. 21 in all of the circumstances of this case and the potential for anxiety in the mother's home about contact with the father when the counselling with the children is pursued, i do not propose to put those orders in place at this time. the father's time with the children including the telephone time, the letters, cards, presents, the photographs, the whether there is an automatic progression from telephone time to supervised time, all of those matters will be before me in june 2022. so i do not propose to make those orders at the moment. 22 i should say the basis of not making those orders is not because i find there is unacceptable risk that somehow the letters would enable the father to track down and identify or locate the children or their school or that he would send inappropriate letters, cards and presents to the children. it is not on that basis. i am concerned at the mother's anxiety and potential anxiety in regard to those matters given what she is alleged to have experienced. i note that paragraph 17 of the section 11f child inclusive conference memorandum indicates that she has never been diagnosed with a mental health issue but she has felt, at times, anxious about the children's safety and wellbeing. 23 there is another layer to this case and that is in the time since separation, the children have had little or no contact with their father. the mother has re-partnered, has two other children and, unsurprisingly, the children, it is said by the mother, have come to refer to her new partner and the father of the other two children as \u2018dad\u2019. that is unsurprising in the circumstances when two of the four children of the household would refer to the mother\u2019s partner as \u2018dad\u2019. it is clear that the mother, based on her statements, proposes that the father not have any further involvement with the children's life at all. that may or may not come to pass. the father's, what i will describe as, personal rehabilitation would contend against that. but i am not determining that at this point. it may be that i cannot determine that matter until final hearing. on the mother's case, the father should not have time or contact with the children or the children be reminded of him other than in the counselling scenario. 24 so for all of those reasons, i will not determine the nature of the contact between the father and the children at this time. i acknowledge the likely profound disappointment to the father of this ruling when he has invested considerable time, effort and money in seeking to reconnect to his children which, of course, is itself an indication of rehabilitation and care and concern for the children. although that would be likely to be experienced by the mother to the opposite effect and that is the nature of the conflict in this situation. 25 the remaining dispute is the issue of whether the counselling that is agreed to happen should have a reference as to the purpose of it and it is asserted by the father's counsel that the purpose of it should be to explore the possibility and options of the children's reintroduction to their father in a supervised setting and sets out a form of words that is sought to be included. the mother seeks to have a different set of words and not including the possible reintroduction of the father but limited to paragraph 40 of the child inclusive memorandum. in my view, the issue of letters, cards and presents is not something that should be determined by the counsellor but i would expect that it is inevitable that such a matter would be raised in the counselling. 26 so to the extent that it is necessary to provide a notation in regard to the purpose of the counselling, i acknowledge there is substance in the father's position that the purposes of the court ordered counselling should be stated. however, i do not intend to put fences around the counsellor as to that therapy and for that purpose, to make that clear, the notation will read: the purposes of the reportable counselling for the children includes: such matters as are apparent to the counsellor as impacting on the welfare of the children, and to support the children in line with paragraph 40 of the child inclusive conference memorandum dated 4 november 2021. to explore the possibility and options for the children\u2019s reintroduction to their father in a supervised setting in the first instance, if appropriate, as well as dealing with their generalised anxieties. 27 in other words, there is substance in both submissions about that counselling aspect. 28 the orders must be in the children's best interests. i take into account all of part vii of the act but, in particular section 60cc(1) and (2) and (2a) which says that i must take into account the safety and protection of the children and give that greater weight when considering the benefit to them of having a relationship with their father. i also take into account all of the matters described at section 60cc(3)(a) through to (m). 29 i also take into account that i have been told by the father's counsel that he intends to undertake, voluntarily himself, two further hair follicle tests to demonstrate his abstinence from substance abuse. i do not underestimate how difficult that can be for someone with a substance abuse problem to deal with that. and for the father's own sake, apart from the sake of his children and those caring for his children, wish him well with that endeavour. on the face of it, there is some modest success so far and time will tell the extent of success with that. 30 i also want to thank the parents, both the mother and the father for both working out some, decisions themselves about the way forward in difficult times. that shows some insight on both their parts in regard to the range of possibilities of what should happen in this litigation. i have already expressed that, were it up to me, i would like to list the final hearing before january 2023 but i do not have those options. 31 and you should take it that, having read this material once, i do not expect it to be reproduced in the next interim affidavit. on the return before me, i will be relying on the material already filed. and hence, the parties are only expected to go to the trouble and expense of updating that material. they do not have to file anything further. for the benefit of the parties, that is so that when we come up for hearing, each of you knows what the other one has already said and that i have read. 32 but it is really important and i would ask you both not to just leave it to your lawyers. if there is something further important that you need to say, do not leave it to friday 7 june. think about that in the couple of weeks beforehand to help your lawyers assist you. associate: dated: 16 november 2021", "metadata": {"filename": "114.txt", "size": 29814, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 29963, "document_id": "114"}},

[ms denys] and myself had a friendship for about one year but after time i found if very difficult to communicate with her the frienship peterred out after around twelve months. i never heard from [ms denys] again until the middle of 2015, she contacted me that the house that she was living in was to be demolished and she had nowhere to live so i relucuantly said to her that she could rent a room in my house, she told me that her friends and family didn't want her so i buckled and let her rent a room in my house. while she was living in my house i was on single newstart allowance until i turned sixty five, in 2020 then i went onto the single aged pension and [ms denys] was on single disability pension as far as i know.[10] (as per original) circumstances of the relationship the duration of the relationship the nature and extent of the parties\u2019 common residence you were, um, trying to get me to move in. you were saying to me, please move in. and i actually asked why, and you said because i love you, i love you, i want you to live with me in the house, in your house. you know, the fact that i was helping you. you were begging me. you said, you know, i\u2019m struggling with money, please come and live with me. counsel for [ms denys]: all right. and do you know whether or not [ms denys] ever slept in [mr kellett]\u2019s room?

[ms o]: when i would sleep over, in the morning [ms denys] would come out of his bedroom. so obviously they were together. i mean, i wasn\u2019t there every day.[17] counsel for [ms denys]: and it\u2019s a photo of you in bed, isn\u2019t it, with the cats?

[mr kellett] and i shared the same bedroom for many years. we were in an intimate and sexual relationship during this time. we had sex regularly. more often than not, [mr kellett] instigated sexual relations between us. in any event, i have never forced [mr kellett] to, or performed any sexual act on [mr kellett], without his consent.[22] the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between the parties the ownership, use and acquisition of the parties\u2019 property ... [mr kellett] was looking to buy a house. we looked at houses together. ultimately, [mr kellett] purchased the property at [t street] in [suburb b] (\"[suburb b] \") which later became our shared residence. i provided the initial holding deposit for [suburb b], in the amount of either $1000 or $2000.[24] counsel for [ms denys]: yes. then prior to you purchasing the house in [suburb b], did you look at other properties? [mr kellett]: i looked at one. it was actually one day \u2013 i saw a house in the morning, and i saw this house \u2013 the second house. that\u2019s when it was purchased. i didn\u2019t look at numerous properties, no. just the two \u2013 one \u2013 both in [suburb b]. counsel for [ms denys]: all right. did [ms denys] accompany you to look at that first house? [mr kellett]: no. counsel for [ms denys]: well, she \u2013 see, she has given evidence about looking at houses together. you dispute that, i take it? [mr kellett]: she came to the \u2013 the one that i purchased. she came over, and she came and looked through with me, yes. counsel for [ms denys]: well, why is she looking at a house with you? why are you looking at a house together? [mr kellett]: because she was a friend. counsel for [ms denys]: i see. you didn\u2019t look at any houses with other friends, did you? [mr kellett]: the first house, i went with my son \u2013 we looked at that together. counsel for [ms denys]: yes? [mr kellett]: and he had to go to work, so [ms denys] came over in the afternoon, and we saw the second house \u2013 the second house on that day.[25] counsel for [ms denys]: ... that clearly was your evidence that [ms denys] inspected the house with you? [mr kellett]: i don\u2019t recall, i don\u2019t recall her coming, no. counsel for [ms denys]: well, why did you give evidence that she did? [mr kellett]: it was after i purchased it, she wanted to have a look at the house before she gave me the money. counsel for [ms denys]: no, that\u2019s not my question sir? [mr kellett]: o sorry. counsel for [ms denys]: why do you give evidence that she attended with you? [mr kellett]: she didn\u2019t attend the initial um... his honour: that\u2019s not an answer to the question either [mr kellett]? [mr kellett]: alright, ask me the question again please. counsel for [ms denys]: yes, why did you give evidence that she attended to inspect the house with you? [mr kellett]: i must have made a mistake. counsel for [ms denys]: it was a very detailed account of what happened, about your son attending in the morning and [ms denys] coming over in the afternoon, wasn\u2019t it? [mr kellett]: yes, i suppose so. counsel for [ms denys]: so, do you concede now that [ms denys] did attend at that inspection? [mr kellett]: i have to concede she did, and i probably... i wasn\u2019t a hundred per cent sure, but now you\u2019re sort of painting the picture, i can, you know, recall it now. she did come, but she had no input to what house i liked, or whatever, she just trailed behind me. the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life i cooked sometimes, i\u2019d say probably a high percentage of washing up is what i did, setting the table, and also making salads, these types of things. because i know you that you actually love having barbeques, i know you absolutely love barbeques, love them. so you liked being the chef, that\u2019s what you enjoyed doing. you liked being the chef, getting the food cooked and prepared, and i would just help on the periphery. i would just check to make sure everything had been turned on and off, and then i\u2019d wash up. that was actually a very regular occurrence, doing the washing up. yes, just next door to each other in fact. and we\u2019d sit down and we\u2019d watch tv. we\u2019d look at each other and have a drink together, and we\u2019d sit there and watch telly. whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship the care and support of children the reputation and public aspects of the relationship other circumstances mr kellett put to ms denys that he \u201cwould continually say\u201d to ms denys that she lived in a bubble. ms denys gave evidence that he used to say to her \u201cyou are my bubble\u201d because she looked after him. ms m gave unchallenged evidence, which i accept, that she asked mr kellett if ms denys made him happy, to which he replied that she is \u201cmy bubble in the world\u201d or words to that effect, which she understood to be mr kellett\u2019s affectionate term for ms denys.[32] (b) mr kellett asked ms denys whether she had a spending problem while she was living with him. she denied that she did. mr kellett enquired whether she went out to shops \u201cday in, day out\u201d. she gave evidence that she would go twice or three times per week. she gave oral evidence that she jokingly said to him that she was born to shop. mr kellett also asked ms denys\u2019 witnesses about ms denys\u2019 spending habits. (c) mr kellett put to ms denys that he used to say to her that she was the laziest person he knew. ms denys agreed that he did. (d) ms denys gave evidence that mr kellett asked her to give up cigarettes if she loved him. she gave evidence she did so, but remained a social smoker. mr kellett put to ms denys that he caught her smoking by the side of the house, which ms denys accepted may have happened once. ms l gave unchallenged evidence that when she visited the suburb b home between 2015 and 2020, mr kellett used to tell ms denys to stop smoking. these interactions are consistent with parties living together as a couple. mr kellett asked ms denys whether she had a spending problem while she was living with him. she denied that she did. mr kellett enquired whether she went out to shops \u201cday in, day out\u201d. she gave evidence that she would go twice or three times per week. she gave oral evidence that she jokingly said to him that she was born to shop. mr kellett also asked ms denys\u2019 witnesses about ms denys\u2019 spending habits.

[mr j]: yes, i am. solicitor for [mr sabato]: okay. how did you find it out? [mr j]: well, that particular weekend in 2021 ... on the way back from [town b] back to [town h], [ms rimas] told me that she was breaking up with him and i said, \u201cfair enough.\u201d well, four weeks after that, i went back to fix the fence. i took my [car] up and i took [ms rimas] and her daughter with me. i had all the materials to fix the fence and the tools. and then [mr sabato] told me later in the day, not at the start, that they had broken up, so i\u2019m going to say they\u2019ve broken up. (emphasis added) counsel for [ms rimas]: ... my client\u2019s instructions are that, after the visit in 2021, she said words to the effect of, \u201ci\u2019m not going back there,\u201d or, \u201ci\u2019m never going back there,\u201d rather than, \u201ci\u2019ve broken up with him\u201d, is it possible that that\u2019s what was said?

[mr j]: she did \u2013 also said what you said at [town h]. i hope you are both well! [mr sabato] and i are no longer things over the years have been difficult! too he was seeing an ex girlfriend in melbourne (3 years ago) i found out! [mr sabato] has told me untruths over the years, also i know he has told people that \u2018[town b]\u2019 is his where the reality is i paid for it with my money (i sold land in [town k]) [mr sabato] has never been able to \u2018save\u2019 he is not good with money! [mr sabato] has been paying me a small rent of $75 a week for staying there! as living with him was very hard! but always remember i have much fondness for you both and take care. i wish [mr sabato] well too, but i need to move on.[12] (emphasis added) i understand [mr sabato] has asked to borrow money for [town b] last week. i said to [mr sabato] i can not look after two houses also \u2018[town b]\u2019 is getting neglected he doesn\u2019t look after it and the pollution of his smoking is staining everything walls, doors furniture so i said \u201ci am selling\u201d he was not happy and then \u2018blackmailed\u2019 me for money when i sell! even though i paid for this myself, he pays me a small rent. but i will pay him for the hot water service he did pay for, i did not know he did this until later (after the fact) as i would of dealt with getting a new one. he said he was to ask you as he wants [town b], he like living there if i sell to him \u2018cheap\u2019 he will leave me alone. then i can walk away hopefully in peace.[13] the nature and extent of the parties\u2019 common residence we continued our romantic relationship despite living under separate roofs. i would stay with [ms rimas] at the [town g] property on the weekends that [l] stayed at [mr c]'s and on the alternate weekends [ms rimas] and [l] would stay with me at the [town b] property.[20] over the years i had regular telephone calls with [mr sabato]. [ms rimas] or her daughter would often answer the phone when i rang and then pass the phone on to [mr sabato] to talk to me.[22] whether a sexual relationship existed the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between the parties counsel for [ms rimas]: when did you have the discussion that gave rise to this agreement, after your medical episode? [mr sabato]: no, this happened way, way before. before we \u2013 before we got the property. she told me straight out she couldn\u2019t afford it, but we would get one \u2013 one under the thing that i pay the mortgage and when we split up, we go fifty-fifty. the ownership, use and acquisition of the parties\u2019 property her agreement was whatever i put in, i get out. whatever it was, 30 grand, i think, at the time, or 40,000. i can\u2019t remember exactly. and then, profit after that. like hypothetically she put in 30,000. the property sold for 100,000. so i would only get property of \u2013 settlement of 60,000. you understand? not the whole 100,000 because she would be taking out x amount of what she initially put in. well, i have repainted, i have put carpets, i have done a hot water service, i have done a heater, [flooring], roofing. there\u2019s so many other things that i can\u2019t \u2013 you know, like, bits that are broken that i have fixed or that i have replaced or whatever. when asked about the town h property in re-examination he gave evidence that he \u201chad done many, many renovations or fixing of certain things on both the [town g] and [town h] property as well\u201d. the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life i didn\u2019t really like the idea, but i did it, because i thought, well, if there\u2019s a problem with my rental property up there, i would probably be the easiest person to go into either [town g] centrelink or [town n] to explain the situation, like if he was hospitalised or things like that, because his family were so far away in melbourne. ... i thought, well, it would probably be a lot easier for me to do considering he was my tenant and i would have to sort of get those formalities in place as well if i had to by centrelink. i\u2019m not sure because \u2013 because of the fact that, from week to week, it used to change and i wasn\u2019t allowed \u2013 i wasn\u2019t aware whether i could travel and get food or whether i could \u2013 because we\u2019ve only got one small supermarket in [town b]. all the bigger shops and clothes and stuff like that were in [town n], which is [10] kilometres away. so i wasn\u2019t aware \u2013 and you would go to the police officer, \u201ccan i travel?\u201d and they said, \u201cwe don\u2019t know.\u201d so there\u2019s...no point in me risking getting a fine or \u2013 during that time. whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship the care and support of children the reputation and public aspects of the relationship other circumstances ...the reason behind that document is due to the fact \u2013 when a couple are together in centrelink\u2019s eyes, they get a reduced amount of income. when they\u2019re apart but living \u2013 like, de facto but living in separate addresses, they get a substantial amount more. so that\u2019s why we\u2019ve done it. ... we were getting more money, but we weren\u2019t doing any wrong legally, or whatever you want to call it. conclusions associate: dated: 18 september 2023 dated: 18 september 2023 [1] family law act 1975 (cth) ss 4aa(1); fairbairn & radecki [2022] hca 18; (2022) 400 alr 613 (\u201cfairbairn & radecki\u201d) at [29].

court record/file.[1] 14. further, at [99], the full court said that: rule 24.13 requires only that the person have a proper interest in the case or information obtainable from the court record. no other limitation is placed upon circumstances in which the court may grant a person access to the court record. in carter & carter the full court considered an appeal against an order by a judge at first instance, dismissing-other than in relation to the consent orders made between parties\u2014an application by a child of those parents to search, or have access to, the court record in relation to the issues of his parents\u2019 divorce and the property and parenting orders made between them. in that case, the child\u2019s parents, who were the parties to the proceedings, consented to him being granted permission to inspect the court record. it is apparent from the reasons of the full court that the judge, at first instance, summarised the purpose of inspection and access to have been: to enable the applicant to know what happened, to assist an understanding of what happened in relation to his family and relationships after the parental separation, to enable the applicant to know which of the parents was, by virtue of the order in the proceedings, supposed to do what, to enable him to ascertain answers to questions such as why he had not been provided with independent legal representation, to enable him, (having received treatment as an adult for mental illness) the benefit of being able to access the information thought to have been held on the court file. it appears from the reasons of the full court that, despite having found that the applicant had a proper interest in the proceedings, the trial judge refused him access to the court record because of concerns which included: reservations about the benefit he might have obtained from inspecting the file, and, in essence, concerns that it was unlikely that having access to and inspecting the file would give him the answers that he sought. the full court allowed the appeal. in doing so, the reasons included that: the provides the criteria by which an application is to be considered and does not entitle the decision to be based on matters not relevant to its terms, the applicant\u2019s stated purpose was prima facie reasonable, the trial judge erred by having regard to irrelevant matters, the correct application of the rule should have been that, once proper interest was established, the court should have considered whether access to the record was reasonable \u2013 and not whether an applicant would benefit from such access.[3] the court held further that a primary judge is required to identify the purpose or purposes for which access to the court record is requested and, having done so, to determine whether access to the same is reasonable for that purpose or purposes,[4] and that a focus on an absence of benefit, flowing from access to the court record, is an irrelevant consideration in the exercise of discretion. associate: dated: 18 september 2023 dated: 18 september 2023 [1] nevins & urwin [2021] fedcfamc1f 342 [13] quoting oates & q and anor [2010] famcafc 202.", "metadata":

[citations omitted] ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (\u201ccarlson\u201d) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case: 5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... [169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide. ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to. parenting 4ab definition of family violence etc. for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person\u2019s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful.

value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (\u201cthe other factors\u201d) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case.

[emphasis added] 52. this ground of appeal is not established. conclusion as to section 90sf(3) factors adjustment. ...in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue. on our adjusted figure for the value of the parties net assets ($1,503,863), adjustment of 10% in the wife\u2019s favour results in an increase in her entitlement of $150,386, and a corresponding reduction in the husband\u2019s entitlement, producing a differential movement between them of $300,772 ... 7] it is also important to recall what was said in phipson & phipson [2009] famcafc 28 when the full court was dealing with another appeal from the trial judge in the present proceedings: ] it is always important to keep in mind that an adjustment of x% for s 75(2) factors leads to a disparity in the value of property received by the parties representing 2 x x%. it is that disparity, measured in \u201cmoney terms\u201d, that requires consideration in determining whether the result is just and equitable: see campbell v kuskey [1998] famca 10, (1998) flc 92-795 at 84,928. 8] the 10% adjustment his honour made on account of s 75(2) factors has led to a disparity in favour of the wife equivalent in value to 20% of the assets. in money terms this represents $187,733 out of a total asset pool of $938,665. apart from the issues associated with the care, accommodation and maintenance of the children, the s 75(2) factors largely balanced out (save that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife would have more capital than the husband). the husband was going to have whatever responsibility remained for the care, accommodation and maintenance of [x]. both parties would have significant responsibility for the two younger children. it is true the wife will have the children with her about 20% more of the time than the husband, but this amounts to only a little more than 70 additional days a year. [109] in our view an assessment leading to a disparity of $187,733 in the capital/superannuation to be received by each party was outside the reasonable ambit of the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion, even taking into account the matters found by his honour relating to the non-payment of child support in the period after the husband gave up his employment. our conclusion is sufficient to enliven appellate intervention (house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513). the appeal will therefore be allowed. ... [112] in our view, given that the children will be with him around 40% of the time, the husband\u2019s accommodation needs for the children would not be significantly different to those of the wife. however, in light of the agreement in relation to child support, we accept that the wife will bear the greater proportion of the burden of maintaining the two younger children (at least for the time being). the husband, on the other hand, will have whatever responsibility remains for accommodating and maintaining [x]. the others 75(2) factors, in our view, are evenly balanced, save for the fact that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife will have 4% (or $37,546) more of the assets/superannuation than the husband. [113] taking these matters into account, and the failure of the husband to pay child support after giving up his employment, we consider there should be a 4% adjustment for s 75(2) factors, creating a disparity of 8% between the parties \u2013 or in money terms an amount of $75,093. 9] in our view, s 79(4)(e) requires those matters to be taken into account in arriving at orders that are just and equitable as between the parties. in arriving at an appropriate assessment for those factors, a dollar value of it should be uppermost in our minds [79] and, of course, the ultimate disparity in entitlements which it might produce. that dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests in property of the parties. step four: just and equitable conclusion & calculations associate: dated: 21 september 2023 dated: 21 september 2023 [1] the child support (assessment) act 1989 (cth) and the child support (registration and collection) act 1988 (cth).[2] referring to the father, not the second respondent.[3] and can also be described as the father\u2019s \u201ckeep\u201d.[4] and can also be described as the mother\u2019s \u201ckeep\u201d.[5] the agreed position.[6] it is clear the reference to s 75(2), the provision applying to married, or once married to each other, couples was a mere \u2018slip\u2019 and the references in the outline of case to section 75(2) were intended to be a reference to s 90sf(3) and is of no consequence.

on 28 october 2021. the father to provide written submissions by 15 october 2021, (b) the mother (and independent children\u2019s lawyer if she wishes to do so ) file any written submissions in reply by 22 october 2021, and (c) the issue as to costs would be determined in chambers on 28 october 2021. 7 this is the determination of the father\u2019s application for costs. 8 the father filed written submissions on 20 october 2021 referring to an affidavit filed by the father\u2019s legal representative on 7 october 2021. i have read this affidavit and the father\u2019s financial statement filed on 6 may 2021. 9 the mother filed written submissions on 22 october 2021. i have read the mother\u2019s financial statement filed on 30 june 2021. 10 in his written submissions filed on 20 october 2021 the father seeks a maximum costs order pursuant to rules 12.10 and 12.11 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 (\u201cthe rules\u201d). this is a misunderstanding of rules 12.10 and 12.11. these rules allow a party to seek at any time during the proceeding an order specifying the maximum costs as between party and party that may be recovered in a proceeding. it is not an order for costs pursuant to section 117 of the family law act 1975 (cth) and part 12.5 of the rules. 11 the object of the ability of a party to seek such a maximum costs order is to support the overarching purpose of the court as identified in sections 190 and 191 of the federal circuit and family court of australia act 2021, rule 1.04 of the rules together with the core principles contained within the central practice direction \u2013 family law case management that the court is to facilitate the just resolution of disputes according to law as quickly, inexpensively and efficiently as possible. rule 12.08 requires that the legal costs incurred in a proceeding must be fairly, reasonably and proportionally incurred and to their amount in the circumstances of the proceeding. further, core principles 7 and 8 imposes obligations on parties and their legal representatives to take a sensible and pragmatic approach to litigation and \u201capplications should only be brought before the court if they are reasonably justified on the material available.\u201d 12 in circumstances where the father\u2019s submissions are supported by way of an affidavit of the father\u2019s legal representative deposing that the father incurred \u201ccosts of $3,800 plus gst on an indemnity basis\u201d and anticipating that a further \u201c$1,000.00 plus gst for a 2 hour appearance on 11 october 2021\u201d will be incurred, i have proceeded on the basis that the father seeks the mother pay the father\u2019s costs thrown away on an indemnity basis. 13 the mother resists any order as to costs and in the event that costs be ordered, resists an order that such costs be on an indemnity basis. 14 the mother submits as a preliminary issue that a costs order cannot be made in this matter with respect to her withdrawing her application in a case filed on 15 june 2021 as the effect of orders made by the court on 23 july 2021 that determined an application in a case filed by the independent children\u2019s lawyer as to the identity of the court expert wherein \u201call outstanding interim applications are otherwise dismissed\u201d dismissed also the current application before the court \u2013 that is, the father\u2019s oral application for costs made on 11 october, 2021 with respect to the mother\u2019s application in a case filed on 15 june 2021. 15 that submission does the mother\u2019s legal representative little credit. it is self-evident nonsense to contend that an order made on 23 july 2021 determined the mother\u2019s interim application to vary interim orders that was maintained and prosecuted by her up until the 11 october 2021 and determined an oral application for costs made some 3 months after the order made on 23 july 2021. 16 the mother\u2019s current application was listed after the determination on 23 july 2021. at no stage prior to the current written submissions as to costs did the mother advise the father, the independent children\u2019s lawyer or the court that it was their view or understanding that the mother\u2019s current application had been dismissed by the court on a summary and ex parte basis when determining a costs issue relating to a prior interim application. the solicitor for the mother when appearing before me on 11 october 2021 advised the court that he had obtained instructions that the mother wished to withdraw her application. clearly, the submission made by the solicitor for the mother that the mother\u2019s application had been summarily dismissed by me in chambers without affording the mother any natural justice was contended only after the father\u2019s oral application for costs was made on 11 october 2021. this contention has no merit and in my view is disingenuous. 17 section 117(1) of the family law act 1975 (cth) provides that each party to proceedings shall bear their own costs. section 117(2) states that if the court is of the opinion that there are circumstances that justify it in doing so, the court may make such order as to costs as the court considers just. the matters relevant to determining what order, if any, should be made for costs are set out in section 117(2a). 18 although s117(2) requires a finding of justifiable circumstances as an essential preliminary to making an order for costs, the high court in penfold v penfold [1980] hca 4 said that an applicant for costs does not bear any additional or special onus. 19 rule 12.13 of the rules provides that the court may make an order for costs on its own initiative or on the application of a party. rule 12.13(4) mandates that a party applying for an order for costs on an indemnity basis must inform the court if the party is bound by a costs agreement and if so, the terms of such costs agreement. in circumstances where this evidence is not before the court, the father\u2019s application for indemnity costs must fail. in any event, for the reasons below i am not satisfied that there are exceptional circumstances in this case that would warrant an order for indemnity costs. 20 thus the remaining question to be determined is whether the mother should pay the father\u2019s costs thrown away on a party/party basis. 21 turning now to the relevant considerations: financial circumstances of the parties 22 the evidence contained in the mother\u2019s amended financial statement filed 30 june 2021 indicates that she is in receipt of an income of $1,853.66 inclusive of child support paid by the father. i find it unusual that the mother\u2019s income and expenditure on a weekly basis is matched to the cent. the mother submits that \u201cshe has no surplus income that she can divert to pay costs.\u201d the mother\u2019s evidence is that she has assets to the value of $7,376.85 and superannuation interests valued at $71,714.41. 23 the father\u2019s financial statement filed 6 may 2021 deposes that the father is in receipt of an income of $950 per week. his recorded expenditure is $853 per week. he deposes he has assets valued at $120,766.00 and superannuation interests to the value of $44,194.00. 24 neither party is impecunious. both parties\u2019 financial circumstances are modest. this factor in a consideration as to costs is materially neutral. 25 i am satisfied that wife\u2019s financial circumstances are not so constrained as to weigh against the orders of costs. whether either party is in receipt of a grant of legal aid 26 neither party is in receipt of a grant of legal aid. the conduct of the parties during the proceedings 27 the sole reason of the listing in the duty list on 11 october 2021 was as to the prosecution by the mother of her application in a case filed on 15 june 2021. 28 the father was put to the expense of filing a response and an affidavit in support to that application that he filed on 7 october 2021. he sought that the mother\u2019s application be dismissed. 29 the mother was put on notice by way of correspondence from the father\u2019s legal representatives dated 17 june 2021 and 6 october 2021 that costs would be pressed on an indemnity basis in relation to the mother\u2019 application. 30 not only was the father put to the expense of responding to the mother\u2019s application but he was further put to the expense of attending court on 11 october 2021. it would have been appropriate for the mother\u2019s solicitor so as to mitigate the costs of the father and the independent children\u2019s lawyer to advise of the mother\u2019s change in position regarding her application and to offer to appear at court on 11 october 2021 by consent. 31 i find that this factor weighs significantly in the father\u2019s favour in an exercise of the costs power. whether a party has been wholly unsuccessful 32 the mother withdrew her application. she was wholly unsuccessful. i find that this factor weighs in favour of a costs order in favour of the father. offers of settlement 33 the father filed an affidavit of his solicitor on 7 october 2021 which annexes the correspondence prior to the listing of the matter before the court on 11 october 2021: (a) letter dated 17 june 2021 from the father\u2019s solicitor to the mother\u2019s solicitors inviting the mother to withdraw her application without cost implications, (b) letter from the father\u2019s solicitor to the mother\u2019s solicitor dated 6 october 2021 repeating the assertion that the mother\u2019s case was without merit and putting the mother on notice that costs would be sought. letter dated 17 june 2021 from the father\u2019s solicitor to the mother\u2019s solicitors inviting the mother to withdraw her application without cost implications, (b) letter from the father\u2019s solicitor to the mother\u2019s solicitor dated 6 october 2021 repeating the assertion that the mother\u2019s case was without merit and putting the mother on notice that costs would be sought. 34 the father\u2019s evidence is, and i find, that no response was received to any of the correspondence. 35 if the offer of settlement dated 17 june 2021 had been accepted by the mother, the father would not have been put to the expense of preparation of a response and supporting affidavit and an attendance at court. i find that this work undertaken by him, in the circumstances, was wholly unnecessary, generating unnecessary costs. 36 i find that this factor alone justifies an order for costs in favour of the father. any other matter to consider 37 the mother submits that her role as the primary carer of both subject children is relevant to the issue of costs. the mother does not outline in her submissions how an order of costs would impede her ability to care for the children. i give this submission little weight. conclusion 38 i am satisfied that the mother should pay the father\u2019s costs of and incidental to the application in a case filed on 15 june 2021 in accordance with items 3 and 13 of the scale as set out in schedule 1 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (division 2) (family law) rules 2021. 39 orders will be made accordingly.

(emphasis added) and that desirability only operates when there is a chance of a meaningful relationship, which is beneficial to the child. it is not, in other words, a question of contact for contact sake. if there is a situation where contact with a parent is, on balance, likely to cause more harm to the child than good, or even is not likely to confer any benefit, then little purpose is served by this court making orders for such contact. that does not detract from the desirability of the child having a meaningful relationship, but the possibility of a meaningful relationship must first exist. (emphasis added) issue of risk 138. the assessment of risk is a predictive exercise and while it is, naturally enough, liable to be influenced by factual findings about past events, the contemplation of risk entails the foresight of possible harm. it is an oddity to expect that the mere possibility of future harm can or should be proven as a probability, as has been implied before (potter and potter [2007] famca 350, (2007) flc 93-326 at [110], [129]). risks of harm must be heeded even if they are improbable eventualities. 139. speaking of the risk of some future occurrence is just another way of expressing the chance of it happening. the concept of chance lies along a continuum, encompassing all outcomes which lie in the range between highly probable and remotely possible, assuming the polar extremes of certainty are ignored. in the current context, the higher the chance of the children\u2019s sexual abuse, the greater the risk of their physical or psychological harm. at some point on the continuum the risk of such harm becomes so potent it cannot be tolerated: it is unacceptable. ... 142. as was recognised by hale lj (as her ladyship then was) in re c and b (children) (care order: future harm) [2001] 1 f.l.r 611 at [28], in child-related proceedings, a comparatively small risk of really serious harm can justify action, while even the virtual certainty of slight harm might not. it could hardly be otherwise, because no prudent adult would willingly expose a child to the risk of sexual abuse when there is an unacceptably high chance of its occurrence, even though the chance is not proven by the evidence to be probable. requiring the proof of any possible future child abuse as a probability would pervert the law as settled by the high court in m v m and malec. (emphasis in the original) it is now well established that \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d includes not merely physical harm but also includes an assessment of the risk of emotional harm: see a v a [1998] famca 25, (1998) flc 92-800 at 84,996, m v m (1988) 166 clr 69 at 77. (2) such an unacceptable risk can include any or all matters that compromise the safety, welfare and well-being of a child, and is examined in light of an accumulation of factors proved: see director general, department of family and community services (nsw) and the colt children [2013] nswchc 5 at [146]\u2013[148]. (3) the components which lead to a conclusion that an unacceptable risk exists need not each be established on the balance of probabilities. the court may reach a conclusion of \u201cunacceptable risk\u201d from the accumulation of factors, none or only some of which are proved to that standard: see johnson & page [2007] famca 1235, (2007) flc 93-344 at [68], endorsing and applying the principles set out in a paper prepared by the hon john fogarty am, \u201cunacceptable risk: a return to basics\u201d (2006) 20 australian journal of family law 249.

[for long runs]. sylvan]\u2019s ability to maintain this potentially stressful role is not indicative of a person who in any way had anger management issues. he has never demonstrated any aggressive speech or body language in the clinician\u2019s presence, regardless of the potentially distressing topics we discussed.[5] ms aa the mother much of her history of the marital relationship had the quality of being a practised narrative. [ms sylvan] was unable to spontaneously provide details of the history and she repeatedly required to refer to her notes during the course of the assessment. her insight into her own mental health was poor. she described periods of extreme \u201cstress\u201d but did not engage in therapy previously. she described intrusive thoughts about [mr sylvan] killing her mother, a high startle response at the sound of an engine, secondary to reported domestic abuse, but did not recognise requiring further assessment or psychological interventions. given her work [as a professional] and her understanding of [mental health disorders], i wondered if she had considered the symptoms of [mental health] disorders and was attempting to ensure there was no history suggestive of these disorders in her presentation. despite this, it appears that she does have some personality vulnerabilities, particularly in interpersonal relationships (previous romantic relationships, her relationship with her father) though there is no evidence of a [mental health] disorder. she did not report excessive alcohol consumption but did report alcohol consumption while breastfeeding. she also did not report or display symptoms of any other psychiatric illness. ... certainty in regard to her mental state and her firm discounting of any depressive or anxiety or trauma symptoms, coupled with her resolute description of the times she sought help as being due to \u201cstress\u201d, suggests a limited insight into her own mental health. the maternal grandmother ms r the children x the reporting of the maternal family on the drive home [x] said to me, \u201cdaddy likes me now.\u201d i replied, \u201cdaddy likes you now buddy?\u201d he said, \u201cyes he let me play [a game] on his phone, we weren\u2019t supposed to play there but we did so he likes me now.\u201d i said, \u201cok buddy\u201d he said, \u201cremember at [suburb u] he didn\u2019t let me play because he didn\u2019t like me.\u201d i replied with \u201cis there ever a time when you feel mummy doesn\u2019t like you?\u201d he said \u201cno\u201d and i said \u201cthat\u2019s good buddy and i want you to know no matter what happens i will always love you.\u201d he gets overly upset when reprimanded. the other day, when coming in from recess he asked to go to the toilet, i said of course but please remember to try to go to the toilet during recess. he got extremely upset and it took time to console him. x\u2019s treating psychologist sylvan] advised this includes more aggressive play behaviours, poorer sleep patterns highlighted by not being able to sleep in his own bed and increased sensitivity to things going poorly. [ms sylvan] reports these behaviours settle after visitations though can take up to seven to 10 days to return to normal patterns for master [x], particularly his sleeping. [ms sylvan] has reported these behaviours are less present when visitations do not occur or have been more spread out due to unforeseen circumstances such as contracting covid19. [ms sylvan] has noted master [x]\u2019s sleeping behaviours only change following visitations with [mr sylvan]. [ms sylvan] advised these behaviours also became present in school following the commencement of supervised visitations in late 2021 which had not been detailed previously. whilst these behaviours have not been observed in session, they are consistent with a child\u2019s response to uncomfortable stimuli and can be a way for them to exert a level of control over their environment or seek safety. i am of the belief master [x] has experienced adverse life experiences a younger age given his clinical presentation and given the reported changes in his behaviours following the separation of his parents and the changes in his behaviour following supervised visit with [mr sylvan], i am of the belief these adverse life experiences are likely related to his relationship with and perception of [mr sylvan]. the supervised service records y the mother\u2019s reporting ... there have been instances where she will say things that suggest that she remembers living with [mr sylvan], eg, \u201cdaddy bad eyes\u201d, and, \u201cscared daddy get me\u201d. the supervisor records discussion and findings as to the children ... if you look at the chronology of those events, my hypothesis is that what happens is [x] is reasonably okay. he then is going to have contact with his father. mum is heightened by this [contact with the father] and unable to attune because of her own experience or her belief in those experiences, and her heightened threat perception. so on the basis of what happened to [mr sylvan]\u2019s parents, there is an increasing and escalating concern in mum, which is not un-understandable, but it contributes to a type of catastrophic thinking for want of a better word to describe it. so that heightens. [x] is then unable to regulate because mum is not able to co-regulate with him. the maternal grandmother, i thought, did very well in the assessment of trying to regulate him but having read her affidavit it is clear that she also is anxious around this, and so there isn\u2019t a system of containment. so when he has the visit his experience of the visit is positive, from what we read in the supervision reports, but the narrative around that visit and the way that his other attachment figures are responding is negative. so there is this conflict between what his own personal experience is and the anxiety in the maternal household. and that may be contributing to why he is responding in \u2013 in an externalising manner after the visits.[23] so i think that, you know, they are aware \u2013 they\u2019re intelligent, articulate, caring children. they love their parents very much, and they wouldn\u2019t want to do anything that would make either of their parents upset or sad or distressed, and so they would avoid talking about that because it doesn\u2019t sit with them, the perception in that household of the father.[24] her honour: it is the mother\u2019s evidence that [y] mostly makes positive comments about the father but...and i\u2019m quoting from her affidavit: \u201c...there have been instances where she will say things that suggest that she remembers living with [ms sylvan], eg, \u201cdaddy bad eyes\u201d, and, \u201cscared daddy get me\u201d. [y] was born [in] 2020, and the parties separated on 2 february 2021. so at that time, [y] was months old...is it your view that those alleged comments could come from a memory that was held by [y] herself? single expert: i\u2019m always hesitant to comment on things about memory, your honour, but with that caveat, no. i think that that is a narrative that is a learned one. she was pre-verbal at the time and had little in the way of any symptoms of anxiety in the observation that \u2013 that i did with her and her father, whereas the anxiety in the maternal household is very tangible. and so i\u2019m by no means suggesting that the mother is deliberately making the children feel unsafe or that there is any malice intended in this, but as an inadvertent, perhaps, consequence of her own inability to contain what for her is a very distressing consequence that the children are having contact with someone who has \u2013 who, in her view, has perpetrated violence against her. that is that it\u2019s \u2013 she \u2013 that is definitely the sense that one gets, and i think the most telling thing about that was in the supervision reports, where [y] \u2013 who was still quite young at the time \u2013 says something like, \u201cmummy \u2013 i don\u2019t like you, daddy, because mummy \u2013 mummy doesn\u2019t like you\u201d. so there\u2019s \u2013 you know, there is \u2013 there is some evidence at least that there is that kind \u2013 that\u2019s the tenor of the narrative. meaningful relationship ... consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child\u2019s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents ...[25] family violence much of her history of the marital relationship had the quality of being a practiced narrative. [ms sylvan] was unable to spontaneously provide details of the history and she repeatedly required to refer to her notes during the course of the assessment. [31] thus the weight to be placed upon the mother\u2019s affidavit is reduced. the father\u2019s allegations the mother\u2019s allegations dinner and socialising the trip to city qq: late 2014 the incident with the father\u2019s flatmate queensland: early 2015 the town vv trip: mid-2015 he has what i would describe as an \u201coff-beat\u201d sense of humour, which wasn\u2019t always taken well by anyone who didn\u2019t share that same sense of humour.[35] you need to protect yourself from your family. they ask too much of your time. your relationship with them isn\u2019t healthy. you give too much of yourself to others, it\u2019s time you start putting yourself first.[36] mother\u2019s day celebration: may 2015 it wasn\u2019t her spending too much time with them. it was me being there as well. so, in those circumstances i was required to be there, and it was often multiple times a week, and it may have just been invitations that came through but they were communicated to me by [ms sylvan] and i felt immense pressure to be able to do that and go to those things every week and multiple times a week. the \u201chomework\u201d i need to know what the actual parameters are to measure your control. what will you do if he puts me down. how often is an acceptable level of contact. what topics are off the table. what about the unrealistic expectations of me cleaning his shed???? the trip to the united kingdom: mid-2015 the trip to city ac: late 2015 i said it because i was upset. it was extremely foolish. it was ridiculous and foolish and that\u2019s why i said i was joking. i completely regret it. it wasn\u2019t about getting into the room \u2013 it was about collecting my belongings. i had picked up some of my personal belongings and i thought she was going to destroy them, like photos of my grandfather. it was very stupid. x\u2019s birth and discharge from hospital: 2016 the maternal grandmother\u2019s visit: mid-2016 the dinner: mid-2016 thanks for the note [ms ab]. i wasn\u2019t going to mention it but i was a bit disappointed considering the chat [ms sylvan], yourself and i had last week. i suppose if you just rehash the content from that conversation, we don\u2019t have to look into this too deeply as it\u2019s just more of the same. i can see that she has interpreted it that way, i didn\u2019t know it was going to go that way. it wasn\u2019t that big an issue \u2013 i didn\u2019t know she would reiterate that information [to the maternal grandmother]. it wasn\u2019t that big a deal for me. x and the mother\u2019s trip to the united kingdom: early 2017 i just wanted to send you a quick separate note to let you know that [mr sylvan] has hit the roof about [mr ad] being at the wedding. he\u2019s always struggled with trusting me and it\u2019s been a long slow painful battle in getting him to feel confident to let me come over for this trip but i think the thought of me drinking at an event on the other side of the world with [mr ad] there is just a bridge too far and he said if [mr ad]\u2019s going he doesn\u2019t want me there, or i\u2019ll find an empty house and a letter from his lawyer on my return. i do understand why he feels so strongly with [mr ad] having been such a messy part of my past but am so deeply sorry this causes a problem for you which is the last thing in the whole world i\u2019d want. i\u2019m going to send you a reply to your email that will sound quite strong as i think that\u2019s what he needs to see me saying. i\u2019m also going to delete this email and could i ask you not to reply to this as he may be checking my phone. i guess this had to come back and (sic) [mr ad] and i in the butt and (sic) one point! if i could just go back and delete it i bloody would! i\u2019m so sorry my love, love you hugely xxxx he seems much calmer this afternoon! may hold off replying properly until tomorrow! huge love and sorry for the panic. xxxx physical assault: early 2017 the move to suburb o: mid-2017 the damage to the motor vehicle: late 2017 mother: hello love, we\u2019ve been invited to [aj street] for dinner thursday night and i\u2019d like to go. i appreciate you may feel differently and there\u2019s no pressure from me to attend if you would prefer not to. i\u2019m sorry i didn\u2019t tell you in person but i didn\u2019t have the courage to. i love you very much and hope you can understand xxxx. the phone call to the mother\u2019s place of employment: early 2018 mother (7:[30] pm): i\u2019m going to be later love, i\u2019m sorry but such good networking. i\u2019ll make it up to you xxxx father: second time you have sprung last minute nights out....you have been untruthful about when you will be here to help. we need a serious chat. mother: or maybe you just don\u2019t listen?

[x] is fine and forget [mr sylvan]\u2019s demand of you needing to be home, that\u2019s him not [x]. xo \u201cthe entertainer\u201d: early 2019 i don\u2019t think anybody cared that there was going to be a [entertainer] i think everybody cared that [x] was going to be there ... what i was told was that [x] was going to be there. i know she\u2019s very capable of looking after [x]. i wasn\u2019t telling her about [x], or about the hen\u2019s night or about the [entertainer]. i said to her did she know that there was beef between my side and her side about it. the wedding the hole in the wall incident with x: late 2019 i can\u2019t remember where this one comes from sorry but [x] had got into some sort of trouble i don\u2019t really know what it was ... that was the time he pushed me while i was pregnant ... and he\u2019d also slammed the door so hard into the wall that like a hole went into the wall from the door handle coming into the room. the mother fainting: early 2020 argument: early 2020 the dog father: i\u2019m at capacity and i\u2019m trying to not let it get to me but if you think i\u2019m distracted it\u2019s because i\u2019m constantly managing the house and the yard and the dog. i know you\u2019re pregnant love and i\u2019m trying. you just need a routine to help it all happen. yesterday i asked you to pick up meat, you just flatly said no. if i do a [supermarket] shop i also do [another shop] every time without fail that\u2019s why we eat good food cheaply i\u2019m not asking for help on these things because i\u2019m an asshole i\u2019m accepting you saying no and moving on but it\u2019s not easy. mother: me not pulling my weight at home has been a constant theme since we moved up to [suburb u], not only is it hurtful it\u2019s simply not true. i never sit down at night until everything possible is done (bar a mop which i have just given up on at the moment until the garden is sorted but it\u2019s certainly more than liveable) mother: the difference is i\u2019m not physically there as much which means you are absolutely doing the lions share father: you asked what\u2019s bothering me and i\u2019ve told you. the other thing is you\u2019re not particularly nice to me. i went through this last time you were pregnant so i know what it\u2019s about and it\u2019s mostly out of your control. the other stuff is within your control, i can handle the meanness of the other stuff is working but not both. mother: every time we have a minute together you\u2019re ranting about how much someone i love has pissed you off. i sit and swallow it for a few nights and then it creates conflict between us. it\u2019s nothing to do with being pregnant. it\u2019s an age old issue that i\u2019ve asked you to handle differently time and time again. mother: plus you refuse to do anything about your snoring which creates huge tension between us all night every night. it means we start everyday with conflict and it\u2019s going to seriously escalate in just a few weeks\u2019 time when we\u2019re both sleep deprived. father: ok cool, instead of talking about it you treat me like shit. you start every day with conflict and i\u2019m the stupid schmuck making your breakfast. if i were you, i would find another method, because you never know how much damage you\u2019re really doing or what the affect would be. it\u2019s like you\u2019re happy to treat me like shit but not a single other soul. that\u2019s a rubbish existence for me. father: and when it comes to your family \u2013 you are the problem not them. mother: i feel like you\u2019re the only person in my life that says a cruel word to me and i feel like i\u2019m under constant attack. then i have to sit there and listen while you joke about how mean i am to you when i\u2019m pregnant? what about you up in my face shouting swearing and pointing, or the bruise that\u2019s on my right shoulder? mother: [x] mentioned your swearing last night and instead of apologising you made him feel bad about himself by telling him he was using the word wrong. father: you should take on board what i\u2019ve told you lied to me twice today too...secondly he weed on the balcony and told me it was [the dog], she got an ass kicking too my life is so weird right now, i don\u2019t have a single person around me doing what they say they will do. it\u2019s sickening.[49] the camping holiday: mid-2020\u2013late 2020 virtual baby shower: 2020 i am fucking fuming sort your shit out leaving me with a crying baby who needs a nap when i\u2019m due on a conference call you\u2019re failing us and our marriage how dare you do this to us i hope it\u2019s worth it. things don\u2019t go to plan when we don\u2019t talk properly love x you need to be more transparent. during the exchange the father then says:- all i ask is that you keep me first tell me first don\u2019t plan without me ... you have to talk with me about anything that concerns us before you act you know that if i do things without confirming with you it\u2019s disruptive isn\u2019t it?[52] the incident in late 2020 mr k, the mother\u2019s cousin: late 2020 sylvan]. can\u2019t believe what you and [mr sylvan] said to [mr k] and [ms g] ... you have cut us all badly, especially [mr k]. [ms sylvan] would not have done this, but it seems the new [ms sylvan] had no hesitation. it goes against all our family values. it has wrecked christmas, caused anger and arguments but most of all you have divided the family...[mr k] was going through a rough time with a breakup, you let your [mr sylvan] throw him out in the street. nice one...take a good look next time you look in the mirror [ms sylvan]. ask yourself if what you have done was a good thing. in fact every time you look in the mirror remember what family you had ... as for [mr k] and [ms g] buying a house near you, it\u2019s nothing to do with you. you put [x] on some sort of pedestal will ruin him. your biggest worry with him is if he grows up with his father\u2019s traits. i don\u2019t know what the future holds [ms sylvan]. it saddens me that happened. the maternal grandmother moving in: early 2021 father: maybe she needs a shock to get her to realise she needs to listen to me. mother: what do you mean by shock [mr sylvan]? father: an argument. mother: i\u2019ll speak to her. father: you better because it\u2019s really beginning to piss me off. x going missing: early 2021 the holiday letting alleged financial control conclusion as to family violence 46. coerce is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as 1. to restrain or constrain by force, law or authority, force or compel, as to do something. 2. to compel by forcible action control is defined in the 7th edition of the macquarie dictionary relevantly as: 1. to exercise restraint or direction over, dominate, command the phrase \u201ccoerces or controls\u201d is expressed disjunctively. however it may be seen that the two concepts are closely related. together they form an expanded concept of the exercise of power, to restrain another or to cause another to act, by force, domination or command. the examples given at s 4ab(2) illustrate the potential modes of force, domination or command as incorporating both physical and non-physical means. for example, control through the unreasonable withholding of financial support constitutes a non-physical means of domination of another. it should be noted that the definition contained at s 4ab does not encompass all occasions where one family member causes another to act other than in accordance with his or her inclinations. the nature of interactions within a family often involves the various members of the family preferring the interests of other members of the family ahead of their own. however, where this is the result of the exercise of power, by force or domination or command, that is, it is the product of coercion or control, it then constitutes family violence and falls within the definition at s 4ab. it should be accepted that the definition of family violence goes well beyond physical assaults to encompass behaviours that, absent context may appear innocuous, but in context may be examples of coercion or control. however, the mere assertion that the conduct has the quality of being coercive or controlling does not make it so. it is necessary that the evidence, particularly where the behaviour is ambiguous and may bear an innocuous explanation, be sufficient to allow a characterisation of coercion or control. by way of example, a pattern of disagreements and criticism can form controlling or coercive behaviour. whether they do or not must be derived from consideration of their form, intensity, context and the impact upon a person. the mere fact of disagreement or criticism does not automatically equate to family violence. the assessment of whether conduct that falls within one of the provided examples constitutes family violence as defined in s 4ab(1) of the act necessarily requires that conduct to be considered in the context in which it occurred. intention on the part of the perpetrator is not a necessary component of family violence under s 4ab of the act and for good reason. risk of abuse or neglect the additional considerations any views expressed by the children he spontaneously reported that he missed his father and wished to spend time with him, and that his mother was kind and he enjoyed being with her.[63] the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parents and other significant persons ... able to demonstrate that he nurtured and protected [x] appropriately, that he was appropriate aligned with him, that he is able to provide [x] access to developmentally appropriate cognitive and social simulation and that he can provide guidance and developmentally appropriate limit setting ...[64] adores and trusts his father. they share a warm and nurturing relationship, evidenced by the joyful nature of their interactions. [x] delighted in playing with his father and looked to him for guidance and support when required. [x] responded well to his father\u2019s authoritative parenting approach, in which the boundaries and expectations were clearly explained. he was noted to startle when his father used a stern voice with him when he was being overly boisterous with his sister, but his response was not sustained or considered unusual.[65] ... her emotional alignment and inability to help him emotionally and behaviourally regulate, as well as the lack of physical closeness [x] initiated with her, suggested an insecure attachment at observation. she also struggled to provide developmentally appropriate limit setting, or containment to [x]. i note that the previous psychologist assessed this attachment relationship as being a secure one. however, it is my understanding that he did not assess this relationship by asking [ms sylvan] to leave or return to the room, nor was there another attachment figure present. this limits the psychologist\u2019s assessment of the attachment relationship between [ms sylvan] and [x] ...[66] ... she was not emotionally aligned with her and her ignoring of [y]\u2019s distress when [x] was dis-regulated, as well as the quiet and self-contained manner in which [y] isolated herself and self-soothed, suggested an insecure attachment to her mother. [y] also did not seek physical comfort or contact with her mother except when being breastfed, though she did seek out her maternal grandmother several times at the assessment. ... was able to demonstrate that he nurtured and protected [y] appropriately, that he was appropriately emotionally aligned with her that he is able to provide [y] access to developmentally appropriate cognitive and social stimulation and that he can provide guidance and developmentally appropriate limit setting. it is noted that he was successfully able to contain both children through play and attend to each one\u2019s needs are some retaining sleep.[67] [y] also delighted in playing with her father and looked to him for guidance and support when required, often seeking hugs. [y] responded well to her father\u2019s authoritarian of parenting approach, in which the boundaries and expectations were clearly explained.[68] the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with the child the capacity of each parent to provide for the children\u2019s needs and their attitude to the children and parenthood ... because i was advised by the psychologist, the child psychologist, to tell them, \u201cthe reason we don\u2019t live with daddy anymore is mummy doesn\u2019t feel safe with daddy ... and \u201cit\u2019s not normal for mummies or daddies to feel unsafe with each other, and we are going to work with some people to help us work out how to make everyone feel safe.\u201d[70] single expert: ... in [x] in particular having that conflict where there is a sense that he\u2019s supposed to have had these negative experiences and be unsafe with his father, but his experience within the supervision and certainly in my assessment is that that\u2019s not how he\u2019s actually presenting. he\u2019s actually enjoying the time. and what that creates for him is a cognitive dissonance and an uncertainty about, well, you know, \u201cmummy says i\u2019m not safe there or she\u2019s not safe, but i feel safe, so what do i do with that?\u201d and it\u2019s unsettling and uncertain and so it creates a distress. her honour: and could that cognitive dissonance also be grounded or be reinforced by the mother, for example, using the word \u201csafe\u201d to [x] on several occasions? her evidence is his psychologist is someone \u201csafe\u201d to talk to. another example was telling [x] prior to his time with the father commencing on the supervised basis that he was going to a \u201csafe\u201d place where he could have a play date with daddy. would using that terminology ground that cognitive dissonance that you\u2019ve just described? single expert: yes ... i think that that\u2019s the work that needs to be done in terms of reassuring the children that where they are is a safe space. and ... i think i mentioned it in my report, that the work with the therapist that [x] was seeing was very focused around managing the child whose parent was having difficulty navigating a domestic violence experience or trauma, and so that was the focus...i\u2019m not trying to be critical of the therapist but i do feel that that was taken as a given and, in some ways, validated, which it needed to be for the mother\u2019s experience and the mother\u2019s trauma \u2013 but, also, it heightened and escalated the response of the children.[71] effect of changes in the children\u2019s circumstances ... provided his secure attachment\u2019s relationships with his father and grandmother is maintained and that his attachment relationship with his mother is strengthened. [x] does not understand why the family left their home or his father, and it is important that he is provided with appropriate developmental scaffolding to understand the circumstances in the care arrangements that are decided upon. this should be done with the support of an experienced and well trained child psychologist.[73] so i think it\u2019s well-established in the literature that disruptions to secure attachments are detrimental, particularly when there has been long or sustained periods of uncertainty in a ... household in which there is a heightened anxiety ... the subtext of a lot of the mother\u2019s and the grandmother\u2019s affidavits it that there is anxiety around ... [x] having contact with his father. and i think that that lack of containment in that system coupled with the severing of the secure attachment could be ... very ... detrimental to [x], in that ... could potentially be experienced by him as quite traumatic and then all the consequences of trauma that we\u2019ve already described could cascade from it.[75] ... in the short term there could be significant emotional dysregulation and anger manifesting as externalising disorders which could disrupt his schooling. it could disrupt his relationship with his mum and his grandmother. it could affect his relationship with his sister. longer term would be abrupt discontinuation of secure attachments, his sense of himself or his internalised sense of himself may be negatively impacted and he has an increased risk then of developing a number of psychiatric conditions, including some of the externalising disorders such as oppositional defiance disorder, conduct disorder, increased risk of substance misuse, depression, anxiety, and etcetera.[76] obligations to financially maintain the children the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with a parent disposition time with orders i think that there are opportunities for coercion and control to occur, but the opportunities are diminished because there is less interaction just by virtue of the fact that people are no longer living together. so the \u2013 each person has more autonomy and agency over their finances, for example, or things like that. so within the parenting relationship, yes, that might occur, but it\u2019s certainly less than if people live together, even if it\u2019s coercive control.[84] ... that is a potential risk, but it\u2019s not one that is evident in my assessment, the latter supervision records, nor does [x] present in a way that suggests that he would have difficulty with his father\u2019s rules. and what was really telling in the assessment was that he was very naturally sought guidance in a \u2013 you know, in a very calm way from his father, which didn\u2019t suggest that he was trying to placate him at the assessment ...[85] but one of the things that was very evident in both parents, if i may be so bold as to say, was they care for their children and their desire to be good parents. i think that came across in both parents really strongly. and i think that that can be a motivator for people to engage in work that helps them to address and contain some of those vulnerabilities and build on strength that each of them have...that if something untoward did happen between himself and the father that he would report this to the mother and/or grandmother and she feels that he would be able to articulate those things in school.[87] i admit in looking at the evidence at around 2015-2016, i had no perception of how she felt in regard to how she and i were interacting. reading some of her text messages there, i\u2019d never seen them. yeah, primarily the impact on her. i had no idea. i needed some time to actually realise perhaps some of these family implications on [ms sylvan]. i never really put her in my mind to understand what was really happening. it\u2019s no excuse to me but i was working massive hours at the time \u2013 12 to 13 hours and commuting for 3 hours a day and so i was really just rushing around trying to get things done. whereas i guess now looking at how my life has changed over the last couple of years has given me the opportunity to think. single expert: it\u2019s not always absolutely necessary to have insight in order to effect change, i guess, is the summary of what i\u2019m saying. it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s useful if the person can tolerate it. ms mahony: it is important, is it not, that the father is able to demonstrate an understanding of what part of his behaviour represents coercive and controlling violence? single expert: yes. but a way to achieve that might be to look, perhaps, at what acceptable behaviours are. ms mahony: so the treatment model might be that the father is engaged in a therapeutic environment where examples of positive behaviour are given to him rather than a focus on the history of behaviour? single expert: yes.[88] the other type of therapy that has really good evidence for people with personality vulnerabilities \u2013 or personality disorders really is something called a mentalization-based therapy. and what that looks at is a person trying to see things \u2013 to be aware of the mental state of other people so that they can respond to it appropriately... and because of the things i was talking about before where cognitive distortions are sometimes protective and then allow people to move on from whatever it is they have done, the longer-tem therapies that focus more on building, you know, empathy deficits, improving a person\u2019s emotional and cognitive understanding of other people\u2019s feelings and a capacity to understand other people\u2019s mental states have more effect in addressing those kind of vulnerabilities.[90] ... in upholding children\u2019s right to protection from sexual, psychological and/or emotional harm, the court must take into account any anxiety on the part of the primary caregiver concerning the child\u2019s exposure to potential harm where such anxiety is likely to impact adversely on that parent\u2019s caregiving ability. ] importantly, the full court in marra held that not only is it necessary for the court to determine whether a parent has a genuine concern about the welfare of the child in the care of the other parent but it is also necessary to determine whether the concerned parent\u2019s parenting capacity will be \u201cdiscernibly impaired\u201d. \u2018discernibly\u2019, or similar expressions that have been used in the relevant authorities to which we have referred, means no more than being an evident or detectable impairment in parenting capacity such that there is an unacceptable risk that the child\u2019s welfare will be adversely impacted. ... the first enquiry is whether there is objectively an unacceptable risk. if there is the court must take steps proportionate to the degree of risk. if there is not, the court may then need to consider whether the residence parent has a genuinely held belief that such a risk exists and whether that will have a significant impact on that party\u2019s capacity as the resident parent and so impinge on the best interests of the children. the court then needs to take steps proportionate to that circumstance ... (emphasis added) in terms of parenting, i think that that is what i was seeing when i did the assessment was in the context of feeling disempowered, an almost frozen response to being able to attend and attune and align with the children. normally if i had seen that, i would have been more concerned than perhaps my report indicates. the reason being that i felt that it was something that could be scaffolded because she presented with other strengths. so she was still functional in terms of her work. she was maintaining relationships with her mother and with her extended family, including her sister. and she was still \u2013 although she was not emotionally attuned at the time and it appears that, you know, she has potentially reactivated in when the children have contact with \u2013 or potentially reactivated when the children have contact with the father, etcetera, her practical skills in terms of parenting the children were very intact. so i felt that, despite my assessment that at the time there was an insecure attachment relationship that that was perhaps or could be attributed to her experiences of domestic violence, but i had no way of saying that definitively because i had two completely separate narratives. and so i hypothesised in my formulation that that was the case and that with the scaffolding that she had, building on her resilience that she would then be able to move towards a more secure attachment and a more aligned parenting style.[93] and i think i was very clear that i think that the mother needs to engage in individual therapy that is around managing sometimes her own anxieties that do not only focus on, i guess, in some way dealing with how the children respond but, rather, her own \u2013 her own experiences and her own feelings \u2013 her own current feelings about this contact because what i think is happening or my \u2013 my primary hypothesis is that because the mother is dysregulated and anxious in the context of the children having contact, she\u2019s unable to attune and align with the children, which is potentially why we\u2019re seeing some of [x]\u2019s escalations at school or at home. that may not be the case. there are many hypotheses for why that might be occurring, all of which i have considered in my formulation when i say he doesn\u2019t have any psychiatric conditions, but i \u2013 that would be my primary view. and the reason that i say that is because when i look through the notes, for example, mum is very \u2013 the mother is very proactive in seeking help for [x] after they leave the family home but in \u2013 and in the intake assessment to the mental health unit she says very \u2013 or the report says that there are no behavioural disturbances noted in [x] at that time, and the way that the narrative goes is that once contact is re-established there are these behavioural disturbances. so that\u2019s my hypothesis and how i\u2019ve made sense of it after i\u2019ve had an opportunity to look at the additional material.[94] ... but i also think from my assessment of her that she has a number of protective or resiliency factors and that with appropriate therapy and interventions she ... has \u2013 she appears to have the skillset to be able to cope with that. so despite the experience of trauma, when i saw her she was not reporting clear symptoms of \u2013 or manifesting as functional impairment in the form of ... ptsd. she was certainly worried and distressed, but with some scaffolding and therapy ... i feel that she has the capacity to be able to do that.[96] further orders to be made so if [x] is going to remain under the care of [mr c], then it is really \u2013 and \u2013 and he\u2019s going to help him manage the transitions, it\u2019s really important that his father be included because what you want is a \u2013 is a new \u2013 is a different perspective or both perspectives to be in the room with the therapist at the same time. i mean, whether he can do that or not and \u2013 and be able to change tack slightly, i guess, is up to [mr c], but in terms of family therapy, i think it has to be an individual, impartial therapist who\u2019s doing that work.[97] her honour: ... you\u2019ve had [x] attending upon this person for over two years, but your evidence is that his behaviour hasn\u2019t improved during that period of time. so have you considered at all that the sessions simply aren\u2019t assisting him? mother: i don\u2019t think the sessions are the aggravator. her honour: right. that\u2019s not what i asked?\u2011\u2011\u2011 mother: yes, i - yes, sorry. her honour: no, i will be quite upfront with you. my concern is this. you\u2019ve got [x] attending upon a person to - from what [mr c] says in his report, to manage some of his behaviours. and there hasn\u2019t been an improvement in those behaviours now for over a period of two years. so my question to you is why haven\u2019t you considered that perhaps it isn\u2019t working, and that [x] needs some other form of assistance? mother: i did seek out another psychologist, one closer to home. her honour: well, no, that\u2019s another psychologist, isn\u2019t it? mother: to, i guess, explore a different model. i - i have asked the - i have asked myself that question. i believe the treatment to be effective and helpful for [x]. her honour: ... it has been two years that [x] has been engaged with [mr c], and the mother\u2019s evidence yesterday was that she hasn\u2019t seen any improvement in [x]\u2019s behaviour during that two-year period. so accepting all of that, is there any recommendation or any comment you want to make about these sessions with [mr c] moving into the future? i appreciate they\u2019ve happened now for two years, because i\u2019m grappling with the question of whether these sessions are in [x]\u2019s best interests? single expert: ... so i think it would be fair to say that they\u2019re not necessarily mitigating his level of hyperarousal, but i also think that the focus of the therapy is different to what [mr c] is doing. so i think the focus of the therapy has to be, \u201chow do you navigate change, and how do you manage when, you know, your \u2013 your mum and dad are not aligned?\u201d, and how do you access [x]\u2019s internal world and strengthen what he already has, which is, you know, he\u2019s functioning very well at school, he has good peer relationships. by and large, he\u2019s not overreacting to things or presenting with a marked externalising disorder, and so i think that is what is necessary to \u2013 to help him to navigate the transition whilst being thoughtful about both his parents. her honour: ... in light of your opinion as to what assistance [x] needs potentially in the future, is it your view that in circumstances where the assistance that [mr c] has been providing to date, if i find was through that lens of family violence, including coercive and controlling behaviour that he was advised of by the mother prior to him commencing sessions with [x], do you think that that assistance that you say that [x] needs is capable of being obtained by [mr c]? single expert: no. i think the \u2013 the focus of the therapy is different. and the nature of the therapy, and i think it\u2019s very hard to unknow something. so as a therapist, if your work has been trauma-focused work, trying to build resilience with a child who has had significant experiences of domestic violence, then - i\u2019m sure that [mr c] is very skilled, and i think you can potentially do it, where you say, \u201cokay. well, that\u2019s not going to be the focus of my work anymore. i\u2019m now going to try and see how this person can align with his father while also maintaining the integrity of his mother\u2019s beliefs\u201d, is a very difficult thing to do, especially as the engagement has been primarily over audio visual link. ... that doesn\u2019t mean that he wouldn\u2019t be able to but i think maybe, you know, a narrative in which that therapy could be safely ended and completed, as the way that you would want a contained therapy to end, because, you know, the \u2013 \u201c[x] has already done that work, and he\u2019s now at a stage when he feels good and safe and comfortable, and he\u2019s going to see his father, and he\u2019s going to see a new therapist who\u2019s going to help him to manage any troubles that he might have because things are going to be a little bit different\u201d, is an easier \u2013 is an easier approach.[98] her honour: ... for example, and in her affidavit she says it again at the suggestion, i think, of [mr c] that when [x] brings up something negative about his father, that she \u2013 well, i will say it out to you. so one of the examples: when negative comments arise from [x], i respond by repeating back what he has said to me, mindful of giving him the opportunity to continue to talk but not expressing any opinion. and i will just give you the first example in the affidavit: started crying and said, \u201cwhen you use that voice it reminds me of when daddy used to hit me\u201d. this is the first time that [x] has ever told me anything of this nature. i said words to the effect, \u201ci\u2019m sorry, buddy. i didn\u2019t mean to make you feel that way. it is important that we brush our teeth. it reminds you of when daddy used to hit you?\u201d so is there a different narrative that you would suggest that the mother should use in those circumstances to reassure [x] that he is now in a safe place? single expert: yes. so in the work that i do with parents and children, i would have a different approach. and so i would be suggesting that there is a validation of his experience, if necessary, but also, you know, a reinforcement of the boundary without the end of that sentence.[99] conclusion associate: dated: 27 september 2023 dated: 27 september 2023 [1] mother\u2019s affidavit, p.127-128.[2] masson v parsons (2019) 266 clr 664 at [8].[3] transcript 3 may 2023, p.13.[4] affidavit of ms cc paragraph 10.

[8] 6. [mr mestre] has recently repaid me $60,000 7. [mr mestre] still owes me $10,000 as of today\u2019s date. counsel: but you gave all the money \u2013 the entirety of the sale proceeds, to your mum? father: yes. .... counsel: as at the date you received the sale proceeds, you owed your mum $219,242.05? father: i don\u2019t know the number. .... counsel: and you have not provided in these proceedings any bank statements to show money that has left your mothers account and come to you? father: that\u2019s not correct. counsel: where do we find them in the evidence father: it\u2019s been provided as disclosure throughout the proceedings. counsel: i call for those bank statements. your mother has filed evidence in these proceedings? father: yes. counsel: and nowhere in her affidavit does she make reference, at all, to monies she has loaned you, does she? father: i don\u2019t know. counsel: i simply suggest to you that\u2019s because there was no loan with your mother. father: that\u2019s not true. counsel: your decision to sell the [suburb j] property was a decision you made in order to try and have that asset removed from the property pool in this matter. father: no. counsel: and it\u2019s just another attempt by you to try and prevent adequate provision being made by way of property orders for [ms goodman] and your daughter. father: no. .... counsel: the first financial statement you filed in these proceedings was on 2 march 2021? ... counsel: i\u2019ll show you a copy of that financial statement. identify in that financial statement where there is any record of a liability to your mother? father: it\u2019s not in that one. counsel: so, we can assume then that in 2 march 2021 there was no money owing to your mother? father: yes. counsel: and while you\u2019ve got that in front of you, go to the third page and have a look at what your total salary before tax was, item 9? father: yes. counsel: and what does it say your weekly income was at that point in time, from your total salary before tax. father: $5,736 counsel: i\u2019ll show you your financial statement on 3 june 2021 \u2013 it refers to it being an updated financial statement. where do we find on that financial statement reference to loan from your mother? father: on the last page in part f. counsel: under the heading \u201cexpenses paid by others for your benefit?\u201d father: yes. and on the last page are the expenses being paid on my behalf. counsel: can i ask you to confirm your salary at item 9? father: $5,736 counsel: you agree with me that part f of the financial statement deals with expenses being paid on your behalf by other persons \u2013 correct? father: yes. counsel: in that financial statement you say your mums meeting your bills and credit cards in the amount of $2,359 per week? father: i don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s a week or a month, i don\u2019t know. counsel: there\u2019s no commensurate liability that appears in the liability section is there? father: no. .... counsel: did she require you to sell the [suburb j] property in the lead up to the trial? fasther: i had to pay her back for some of my legal fees she had been paying for ongoing. counsel: you sold the [suburb j] property for legal fees? father: well, that\u2019s part of it. counsel: you\u2019ll have to give more of an explanation, because we don\u2019t know what your mum has been paying for. there is no evidence about any of the loans in your mother\u2019s evidence, your evidence or your accountant\u2019s evidence. you say your mother required you to sell the [suburb j] property, did she? father: my mother required me to pay back the money she had been lending me. counsel: and how much did she say to you that you had to pay her back? father: she didn\u2019t specify an amount. counsel: did she send this to you in an email, text message or was it in a conversation? father: she would\u2019ve spoken to me about it, [ms n] the accountant would\u2019ve spoken to me about it. counsel: they would\u2019ve, or they did? father: they did. counsel: did you say to your mum, well look, we\u2019ve got a final hearing in may when property issues are going to be resolved, just wait until that is sorted out and i can pay you back then. did you ask your mother to delay calling in that loan until your property proceedings were imminently dealt with by this court? father: yes counsel: and this is the same person that is going to lend you money to effect a property settlement with [ms goodman] in order to keep the [suburb c] property. father: yes. counsel: because in effect, what your mother is going to be doing is giving you back the money you parked with her from the [suburb j] property isn\u2019t she?

court observed that the welfare of the child remains the paramount consideration and in considering such welfare, the court must take into account, any anxiety held by the primary carer concerning the child\u2019s potential harm where such anxiety is likely to adversely impact that person\u2019s care-giving ability. in taking account of the beliefs of the primary carer and the effects of such beliefs on that person and the consequent harm to the child, a subjective test is required. (b) however, it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: russell & close [1993] famca 62 (\u2018russell & close\u2019). (c) it is not necessary that the belief should be reasonably and objectively based, but rather whether it is genuinely held: russell & close. (d) despite no apparent expert evidence in support of the primary carer\u2019s apprehension, the full court in dunst & dunst [2016] famcafc 15 at [119] did not criticise the trial judge for concluding that whilst the available evidence fell short of proving the primary carer\u2019s capacity would deteriorate and impinge the children\u2019s best interest (there having been a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder (\u2018ptsd\u2019) and expert evidence of the genuineness of the apprehension but not about such apprehension impinging capacity), the trial judge nonetheless found that the primary carer\u2019s fear was genuine and objectively reasonable and remained a feature of the evidence favouring curtailment of the children\u2019s interaction with the other party. however, it must be established that the belief is genuinely held and where the entirety of the evidence demonstrates that the belief is entirely irrational and baseless, the genuineness of the subjective believe will be open to doubt: russell & close [1993] famca 62 (\u2018russell & close\u2019).

appropriate basis upon which litigation can be settled. the failure to heed a reasonable offer in the circumstances where there is adequate knowledge to the parties at the time of the offer is made to

knowledge at the time the offer was made to give it proper consideration, (b) whilst the wife had concerns about the business valuation, the business comprised a relatively small part of the parties\u2019 assets and was ultimately valued at a lower figure than was used for the purposes of the husband\u2019s offer. the wife\u2019s own evidence at trial was inconsistent with her belief the business was of significant value, including to the effect that the husband was a poor businessman, that he didn\u2019t work hard in the business and his financial contributions generated from the business were modest, (c) the offer was conveyed sufficiently early (more than 12 months prior to the final hearing), such that the parties would have avoided significant legal costs had it been accepted, (d) the wife was provided with 28 days to consider the offer to settle, which i consider to be a reasonable period of time considering the parties\u2019 financial circumstances are not complex, (e) as is evident from the outcome of these proceedings, the husband\u2019s offer to settle was a reasonable offer, (f) the offer was expressed in clear terms, setting out the assets as agreed by the parties in mediation (this was not disputed by the wife, although she contended some of the values later proved not to be current or accurate), clearly identifying what each party would receive and articulating the effect of the offer in both percentage and monetary terms, and (g) the husband recorded his belief that the parties\u2019 home was of a higher value than the value relied

this matter: the husband recorded his belief that the parties\u2019 home was of a higher value than the value relied upon in his offer. i note the following comments made by wilson j in agosti & agosti [2021] fedcfamc1f 72 at [34], which also apply to this matter: once it is recognised, as it must be, that the relevant date for the consideration of property and its value is the date of the trial in court or the arbitral hearing in an arbitration, then it must also be recognised that often the value of real estate increases between the date of the rejection of an offer of compromise and the date of a trial in court or a hearing in an arbitration. but the mere fact of that occurrence should not deprive a party of his or her costs where that party has bettered at trial or arbitration the sum that was the subject of the offer of compromise. where property prices are increasing, it is always possible for an offeror of a compromise to state that the offer is open for a prescribed period but not beyond. if the market increases between the rejection or lapse of that offer, a respondent can hedge his or her risk by putting a different offer of compromise to reflect the movement in property prices. but that is an altogether different proposition to saying that by reason of the increase in property prices a party who, after trial or arbitration, betters the sum that was earlier offered should not have his or her costs. such other matters as the court considers relevant calculation of costs a party applying for an order for costs on an indemnity basis must inform the court if the party is bound by a costs agreement or costs agreements in relation to those costs and, if so, the terms of the costs agreement or costs agreements. of a specific amount, or (b) as

the children spending significant time with the father.[19] very instance creates a further opportunity to undermine the mother as a mother, as a parent, and sometimes as a person, but it seems to be predominantly about parenting and her capacity to make decisions for the children.[20] the father expressed a strong sensitivity to threats, real or perceived to his capacity to connect with his

[mr kamber] appeared full of rage. his eyes were wild, intense and focussed on me. his jaw and body were coiled and tense. i did not want to leave the room where i was concerned about trying to calm [x] down. i did not feel that i could talk to [mr kamber] in that state. i felt i had no other option but to seek the assistance of the police to try to deescalate the situation. july 2020 discussion on competing allegations communication summary of contentions y\u2019s birthday party i was very surprised and disturbed to receive your group message to [ms m], [ms n] and me on [chat group]. firstly, given this was something i had been organising with them for a weekend on which the children are with me it is highly inappropriate to insert yourself into the arrangements... ... in accordance with clauses 18 and 19 of our consent orders, you are not currently able to attend the party. ... then i would be grateful if you would simply send a group message to [ms n], [ms m] and me saying that you won\u2019t be able to attend after all but that we should go ahead as we have arranged. ... it makes clear that the orders you insisted upon and the evidence put to the court by your lawyer was false, this is quite disturbing and will surely be observed negatively by her honour in any future court appearances should they be required. ... given though that you are showing a mature ability to co-operate, i will not stand in the childrens way by blocking this, despite the orders. in this case i will let you attend [y]\u2019s birthday ... (emphasis in bold added) if you don\u2019t create an awkward situation as you did with [y]\u2019s birthday party, then i suspect we\u2019ll be fine. i know you won\u2019t admit it (leopards, spots etc), but that was all your responsibility. y\u2019s birthday covid-19 pandemic just one further thought on this for now - it would be good if the receiving parent were to do a rat just before the kids were due to come into their care. i\u2019m very happy to do so, and share the results with you. are you able to agree to this? i note that in the situation where i was a close contact, with no symptoms, and a negative pcr test on day 6 you didn\u2019t consider testing \u201cnot otherwise necessary\u201d. quite the opposite, you attempted to control my behaviour coerce me into sharing private medical information with you and threatened to breach our court orders, causing me incredible stress and anxiety. this is domestic violence. conflict over school holiday time you are once again blackmailing me and controlling and manipulating the children\u2019s access to their father for your own selfish purposes. parent-teacher interviews 2023 treatment after injury medical condition sport unfortunately [ms tackett] has told the school it isn\u2019t safe for [y], and has shown them the treatment plan as evidence for this. the school cannot enrol her given this without your confirmation. i\u2019m so sad for [y] being given the idea that she is more fragile than she is, that she is limited from doing the activities she wants to do that are safe for her to do. please can you reply to this email confirming it is perfectly safe for her to commence training. ... please reply to this. please help my little girl not grow up afraid and limited by imaginary concerns. (emphasis as per original) excellent news - i now have written confirmation from [y]\u2019s specialist that it is indeed suitable and safe for her to start [playing sport]. ... [dr c] and [ms p] have made clear to me the limitations that should genuinely apply to [y] and those that should not during a meeting in january this year. you have interpreted previous meetings with them incorrectly and appear to be training [y] to be far more risk averse and scared than is necessary. this is sad and damaging to a little girl trying to build her confidence in the world. \u201cdaddy said the doctor said it\u2019s fine for me to do [sports] [sic]\u201d, (b) \u201ci just like the sound of the words \u2018[sports]\u2019 [sic]\u201d, (c) \u201cdaddy showed us videos of people doing [sports] [sic]\u201d, and \u201ci just like the sound of the words \u2018[sports]\u2019 [sic]\u201d, (c) \u201cdaddy showed us videos of people doing [sports] [sic]\u201d, and \u201cdaddy showed us videos of people doing [sports] [sic]\u201d, and x\u2019s asthma and treatment i would like to give [x] a little longer to practice holding something under his tongue for a longer period before commencing full treatment.[39] the children being told by you that they aren\u2019t capable is undermining their development with respect to self confidence and independence. luckily this is still supported when in my care, but i urge you to see our children as the capable young people they are and support them appropriately, rather than limiting their independence.[40] ... i\u2019ve given him venting [sic] each time, but it sounds like it might be a good idea to start him back on [medication] again. could you please confirm that you\u2019ll do this? two puffs once a day, plus ventolin for relief. after a back and forth, the father stated: i am quite capable of caring for our children and making medical decisions that are in their best interests based on the information available. ... [ms tackett], we must each accept that as separated parents each of us is free to make parenting choices we see fit. you and i won\u2019t always agree on what these decisions should be. however it is really quite inappropriate to attempt to control the other parent or demand action from them in the way you are doing. it is a form of coercive control that i wish you would desist from. the father expressed a strong sensitivity to threats, real or perceived to his capacity to connect with his children resulting in recurrent impasses and standoffs with the mother.[42] music lessons you made an arrangement that effects me but also but couldn\u2019t be bothered or were too disrespectful or too disinterested in co-parenting to tell me about it. has claimed that you are telling him the owner of the [instrument] wants it back. i note that you haven\u2019t actually communicated this to me. i also note that it is manipulating the children to tell them such things, implying that i am somehow denying the owner the return of the item when you haven\u2019t even communicated this. i\u2019m actually not sure it\u2019s true. you were clearly incapable of showing any patience here and instead chose to rush ahead with your own arrangements. [x] will continue to have lessons with [mr s]. the impact of the father\u2019s communication on the mother\u2019s parenting it sounds like he won\u2019t be told. he won\u2019t even accept information or a suggestion that he doesn\u2019t agree with, which is going to make the parenting impossible, because every instance creates a further opportunity to undermine the mother as a mother, as a parent, and sometimes as a person, but it seems to be predominantly about parenting and her capacity to make decisions for the children. so it\u2019s almost like a dogged refusal to cooperate.[46] dr barnett sc: the fact that there has been abysmal communication by my client, the majority of which occurred prior to you seeing the family, doesn\u2019t change those benefits that you had accepted from me or that you had given evidence about for the children in both parents being involved in these decisions? [ms g]: well, it does change it, in that if the mother continues to be exposed to \u2013 and it\u2019s not just the frequency. that\u2019s one thing. but it\u2019s the magnitude of denigration and undermining of her parenting every time she wants to exchange medical information or health information or educational information. then she is not an equal partner. she can\u2019t be an equal partner whilst she\u2019s being subjected to that. so we\u2019re now looking at a situation where it can\u2019t be equal parenting because there\u2019s an imbalance of power there. whilst the father continues to denigrate her and use a parenting app which is supposed to assist communication to continue to denigrate her, means that she is not going to be an equal partner in making decisions. she will, over time, i would expect, either not communicate, not argue for her children and advocate for them when she thinks she needs to, and acquiesce to his demands because it\u2019s not an equal footing.[47]

[ms g]: well, if she is sole communicator, yes, she does, she has the sole responsibility of communicating that information, but then she also has the potential to duck and cover after she has delivered it. i mean, she doesn\u2019t have to continue to engage with him around those decisions because either he wishes to discuss it respectfully, if we\u2019re talking about education, if he doesn\u2019t wish to discuss it respectfully, then she can end it right there. in terms of medical, she has to be in a position, yes, of delivering it, but then, again, once she has delivered the information, she can stop communication there. i mean, she should not be subjected to ongoing verbal abuse and denigration in the course of just day-to-day parenting. and it sound, you know, it\u2019s this ongoing nit-picking every little thing.[56] appointment of a parenting coordinator improvement of communication and consequential increase in the father\u2019s time the father\u2019s time with the children g]: but on balance, i would have to say, if we go back to [x]\u2019s comments, you know, it\u2019s about being fair to mum and dad, not about what he may really want. his primary focus is on what\u2019s fair for the parents. and this happens when children are placed in ongoing high-conflict situations with their parents. they learn to stop thinking and feeling for themselves and they think and foremost about what the parents might want or how the parents might react. and over the long-term that has huge detrimental effects on their development and their mental health.[57] the orders will minimise the interaction between the parents, (b) the orders will allow the father to have contact with the children\u2019s school, (c) the orders will provide for a weekday afternoon where the father can organise the children to attend an extra-curricular activity or assist with homework, and (d) the orders will provide a lengthy gap in the periods of time spent by the children, which will provide the children and the mother with respite from having to respond to the father\u2019s presence in their life. the orders will allow the father to have contact with the children\u2019s school, (c) the orders will provide for a weekday afternoon where the father can organise the children to attend an extra-curricular activity or assist with homework, and (d) the orders will provide a lengthy gap in the periods of time spent by the children, which will provide the children and the mother with respite from having to respond to the father\u2019s presence in their life. the orders will provide for a weekday afternoon where the father can organise the children to attend an extra-curricular activity or assist with homework, and (d) the orders will provide a lengthy gap in the periods of time spent by the children, which will provide the children and the mother with respite from having to respond to the father\u2019s presence in their life. the orders will provide a lengthy gap in the periods of time spent by the children, which will provide the children and the mother with respite from having to respond to the father\u2019s presence in their life. school holidays from the end of school until 20 december, (b) from 20 december until 15 january, and (c) for the remainder of the school holiday period. from 20 december until 15 january, and (c) for the remainder of the school holiday period. for the remainder of the school holiday period. mother\u2019s day/father\u2019s day overnight stays away from home ancillary matters notification of y\u2019s medical condition ... will ensure that all safety precautions and medical protocols are followed as recommended by [y]\u2019s treater, [dr c] to ensure that treatment for [y]\u2019s [medical condition] is available. ... will ensure that all safety precautions and medical protocols are followed as recommended by [y]\u2019s treater, [dr c] (or any other treating expert including the nurse practitioner working with [dr c]), or any other treating expert, to ensure that treatment for [y]\u2019s [medical condition] is available.

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 3 february 2022 federal circuit and family court of australia(division 2) bagonas & mestri [2021] fedcfamc2f 349 orders the court orders that: 1. the application for final orders filed on 18 february 2020, amended on 1 september 2021 be dismissed. 2. order 3 of the consent orders made on 28 april 2020 be discharged and within 7 days of the date of these orders, the trustee release the $100,000 currently held on trust to the trust account of the respondent\u2019s solicitor for the sole benefit of the respondent absolutely. reasons for judgmentjudge harland: 1 the parties agree that they were in a de facto relationship from 2001 to 2013. the issues i am asked to determine are: (1) did the parties\u2019 de facto relationship end in 2013 or 2019? (2) if the de facto relationship ended in 2013, should the applicant be granted leave to proceed with her application seeking property adjustment orders out of time? (3) in the event the court finds the relationship ended in 2019, or grants leave to the applicant to proceed out of time, should there be any adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests? did the parties\u2019 de facto relationship end in 2013 or 2019? (2) if the de facto relationship ended in 2013, should the applicant be granted leave to proceed with her application seeking property adjustment orders out of time? (3) in the event the court finds the relationship ended in 2019, or grants leave to the applicant to proceed out of time, should there be any adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests? 2 at the commencement of the trial the parties confirmed that they wished for the threshold issue and the substantive property adjustment application to be heard at the same time. this was reflected in the notations to the orders made on 28 april 2021. 3 the applicant\u2019s case is that she and the respondent were in a de facto relationship from 2003 up until 2019. she seeks a property adjustment. she says she made greater initial contributions and made significant contributions during the relationship including the homemaker role, such that it would be unjust if no property adjustment order is made. 4 the respondent\u2019s case is that the parties\u2019 de facto relationship ended in 2013 and whilst they remained living in the same house following this, they remained friends. he argues that the applicant\u2019s application is out of time. he argues that she should not be granted leave to proceed out of time. he further argues that even if the applicant is granted leave to pursue her application out of time, or the court finds the relationship ended in 2019, it would not be just and equitable to make any adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests. 5 the applicant relied on the following material: (1) affidavit of ms bagonas filed 1 september 2021, (2) affidavit of ms x filed 1 september 2021, and (3) financial statement of ms bagonas filed 1 september 2021. affidavit of ms bagonas filed 1 september 2021, (2) affidavit of ms x filed 1 september 2021, and (3) financial statement of ms bagonas filed 1 september 2021. 6 the respondent relied on the following material: (1) affidavit of mr mestri dated 13 september 2021, (2) financial statement of mr mestri dated 13 september 2021, (3) affidavit of ms b dated 20 march 2020, affidavit of mr mestri dated 13 september 2021, (2) financial statement of mr mestri dated 13 september 2021, (3) affidavit of ms b dated 20 march 2020, 7 the issue of leave was only dealt with cursorily during the hearing. this is not as important in circumstances where the threshold hearing and the substantive hearing proceeded together. this is particularly so, as the respondent\u2019s position is that even if the applicant does not need leave, it would not be just and equitable to make any order for adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests. 8 for the reasons i shall explain, i will dismiss the initiating application. i am not satisfied that the parties were in a de facto relationship after 2013. the evidence before the court does not support a finding that the de facto relationship continued after 2013. although the parties did continue to live together after 2013, this in and of itself is not enough to satisfy that the de facto relationship continued. when considering the overall circumstances and evidence more holistically, i am not satisfied that they were in a de facto relationship after 2013. 9 i have also determined not to grant leave to the applicant to proceed out of time, as i am not satisfied that it would be just and equitable to make an adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests. evidentiary issues 10 the applicant was legally represented when she commenced the proceedings. at the trial, the applicant represented herself and prepared her affidavit in support of her case. the applicant annexed emails from four individuals who she say support her contention that they were in a de facto relationship until 2019. as i explained to her at trial, none of these are admissible as evidence because each deponent would have been required to swear or affirm an affidavit and be available for cross-examination. 11 the trial was adjourned part-heard to enable the applicant to receive pro bono legal advice. during that period, she filed an affidavit of ms c, one of the individuals who had provided an email previously. i did not allow the applicant to rely on this affidavit as it would be entirely unfair to the respondent to allow the applicant to put on evidence during the course of the trial, whilst she is under cross examination. 12 as is common when self-represented litigants prepare their affidavits, and also in instances where affidavits are prepared by lawyers, the applicant expresses several opinions and conclusions in her affidavit which are not evidence. for example, she complains about the respondent selling the property located at d street, suburb e (\u201cd street, suburb e property\u201d) in december 2020. further, she states in her affidavit she believes that he may have sold it for less than what he could have obtained because of the covid-19 pandemic. this is an unqualified opinion and not based on any evidence. 13 both parties expressed unqualified opinions about their respective medical conditions in their trial affidavits. the respondent annexed several medical reports to his affidavit. these are not admissible. in order to rely on such opinions, his doctors needed to swear or affirm affidavits and be available for cross-examination. 14 shortly after the cross-examination of the applicant began, it was necessary to issue her a warning. i granted her a certificate pursuant to s 128 of the evidence act 1995 (cth) adjourned the hearing to enable the applicant to receive pro bono legal advice with respect to the effect of the certificate. the hearing could not proceed the following day as she had not yet received independent legal advice. 15 the certificate was granted with respect to her evidence concerning her representations to the australian taxation office (\u201cato\u201d) and centrelink about her relationship status. legal principles threshold issues for de facto relationships 16 section 90rd of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d) enables the court to declare that a de facto relationship existed or never existed. it also enables the court to determine the periods of the relationship, when the relationship ended and where each of the parties were ordinarily resident during the de facto relationship. the applicant has the burden to prove on a civil standard that they were in a de facto relationship. the determination of whether or not a de facto relationship existed after 2013 is a matter for factual determination and not an exercise of discretion. 17 the de facto relationship must have existed for at least two years before the court may make financial orders and must have existed until at least 1 march 2009 when the family law amendment (de facto financial matters and other measures) act 2008 (cth) commenced. 18 as mushin j pointed out in moby & schulter [2010] famca 748, (2010) flc 93-447 (\u201cmoby & schulter\u201d), the definition of a de facto relationship in section 4aa of the act is a very broad one. 19 in lynham v director-general of social security (1983) 52 alr 128 at page 131 fitzgerald j said: each element of a relationship draws its colour and its significance from the other elements, some of which may point at one direction and some in the other. what must be looked at is the composite picture. any attempt to isolate individual factors and to attribute to them relative degrees of materiality or importance involves a denial of common experience and will almost inevitably be productive of error. the endless scope for differences in human attitudes and activities means that there will be an almost infinite variety of combinations of circumstances which may fall for consideration. in any particular case, it will be a question of fact and degree, a jury question, whether a relationship between two unrelated persons of the opposite sex meets the statutory test. 20 this passage has been quoted with approval by the full court of the family court in sinclair & whittaker [2013] famcafc 129 and crick & bennett [2018] famcafc 68. i also have regard to the comments of the full court of the family court in delamarre & asprey [2015] famcafc 159 at paragraph 18: it must also be pointed out that there is no requirement in the act that a court in applying s 4aa is required to carry out a specific evaluation and/or weighing up of the factors in favour of and against a finding of a de facto relationship. indeed, s 4aa(3) may well suggest to the contrary. 21 section 4aa of the act defines a de facto relationship and includes a number of criteria which may be relevant to the court to consider in determining whether or not a de facto relationship exists between the parties. there are two preliminary matters and that is that the parties must not be legally married to each other and must not be related by family. neither of those apply here. 22 two people are defined to be in a de facto relationship \u201chaving regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.\u201d 23 section 4aa(2) of the act includes a number of criteria which the court may consider in determining whether or not a de facto relationship exists. it is not necessary to make a particular finding about all or any of the matters listed. the court is entitled to attach such weight as any of the matters as may be appropriate in the circumstances of the case: section 4aa(5). (2) those circumstances may include any or all of the following: (a) the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship. (3) no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. (4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case. (5) for the purposes of this act: (a) a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and (b) a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship. those circumstances may include any or all of the following: (a) the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship. (3) no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. (4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case. (5) for the purposes of this act: (a) a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and (b) a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship. the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship. a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and (b) a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship. 24 these factors are to be considered holistically. 25 moby & schulter also involved a dispute about whether or not the parties were in a de facto relationship and if they were there was a dispute over the periods they were in such a relationship. in that case the parties disagreed about many of the material facts. as a consequence of this the credibility of the parties and their supporting witnesses was very important. credibility is important in this case as well. principles applying to property cases 26 part viiia is the part of the act dealing with property, spousal maintenance and maintenance agreement between de facto partners. the major provisions relating to de facto property division are contained in ss 90sm(1), 90sm(3), 90sm(4), and 90sf(3) of the act. 27 until the high court decision in stanford & stanford [2012] hca 52, (2012) 247 clr 108 (\u201cstanford\u201d), the position in respect of the process to be applied to the resolution of matrimonial property cases was said to be well settled with a preferred approach as set out by the full court in hickey & hickey & attorney-general (intervener) [2003] famca 395, (2003) flc 93-143 at 78,386 [39]. 28 the high court considered the operation of s 79 of the act (which has almost identical terms to s 90sm) in the matter of stanford. in this case, the majority stated at [35]-[36] that: 35. \u201cit will be recalled that s 79(2) provides that \"[t]he court shall not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. section 79(4) prescribes matters that must be taken into account in considering what order (if any) should be made under the section. the requirements of the two sub-sections are not to be conflated. in every case in which a property settlement order under s 79 is sought, it is necessary to satisfy the court that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order.\u201d 36. the expression \u201cjust and equitable\u201d is a qualitative description of a conclusion reached after examination of a range of potentially competing considerations. it does not admit of exhaustive definition. it is not possible to chart its metes and bounds.\u201d [footnotes omitted] 29 the high court found three fundamental propositions with respect to the application of s 79, which can be summarised as follows: 1. firstly, in order to ascertain whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order, it is necessary to identify the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. the high court emphasised the word \u2018existing\u2019. 2. secondly, although s.79 gives the court a broad power to make property settlement orders it may not be exercised in an unprincipled fashion. there must be no assumption that the parties\u2019 interests are or should be different to their existing interests. 3. thirdly, when considering whether making a property settlement order is just and equitable the court must not assume that one or the other party has the right to a property adjustment order. the court must give separate consideration to s.79(2) in addition to the matters referred to in s.79(4). 30 in stanford the high court indicated that, in the vast majority of matrimonial property cases, the requirements of s 79(2) will be readily satisfied, largely as a result of a consideration of the circumstances of the parties concerned, particularly the nature of their separation. 31 the high court also pointed out that what is just and equitable is different in every case. 32 the principles referred to in stanford are equally applicable to de facto property matters. see watson & ling [2013] famca 57, (2013) 49 fam lr 303. principles applying to applications for leave to proceed out of time 33 the principles with respect to an application out of time are well known. 34 the full court of the family court in in the marriage of whitford [1979] famca 3, (1979) 4 fam lr 754, commented that there are two questions arising in these types of applications, being: (a) whether the court is satisfied that the applicant or child of the marriage would be caused hardship if leave were not granted, (b) if the court is satisfied that hardship would be caused, then whether or not the court should exercise its discretion to grant or refuse leave to institute proceedings out of time. whether the court is satisfied that the applicant or child of the marriage would be caused hardship if leave were not granted, (b) if the court is satisfied that hardship would be caused, then whether or not the court should exercise its discretion to grant or refuse leave to institute proceedings out of time. 35 the full court said that the court\u2019s discretion in granting an application out of time should be exercised liberally in order to avoid hardship, but nonetheless needs to be exercised in a manner that would not render nugatory the requirement for proceedings to be instituted within time and the time limits have been imposed by the courts in various contexts for centuries. 36 i also refer to the high court decision of gallo & dawson (1990) 93 alr 479 and, in particular, mchugh j\u2019s comments, with respect to the purpose of the rules to allow for an extension of time is to enable the court to do justice between the parties. in order to determine whether or not there would be an injustice to the parties if leave were not granted. again, it is necessary to consider the history of the proceedings, the conduct of the parties, the nature of the litigation and the consequences for the parties for either the granting or the refusal of the application whilst also bearing in mind the purpose behind such time limits. contributions initial contributions 37 there was no dispute between the parties about their respective initial contributions. they also largely agree with respect to the current table of assets and liabilities. 38 the parties agreed the following about their respective initial contributions: when the parties met the applicant was 48 years old. she has 3 adult children. she owned a property at f street, suburb g (\u201cf street, suburb g property\u201d) which was worth approximately $280,000 with a mortgage of $60,000. the applicant had superannuation interests of approximately $70,000 and a car worth approximately $10,000. 39 the respondent was 40 years old and the parties agreed he had approximately $65,000 in savings and superannuation of about $30,000. shortly after the relationship commenced the respondent received an inheritance from his father\u2019s estate of approximately $27,000. the applicant agrees that the respondent received this. current assets and liabilities 40 the respondent\u2019s lawyer prepared a document entitled \u201ctable of asserts, liabilities, contributions and future needs\u201d which appears at pages 1-7 of the court book. at the beginning of the trial, the parties identified the issues that were agreed and which were disputed. the parties agreed that their assets and liabilities at time of trial are: table of assets and liabilities applicant\u2019s individual assets h street, town j $850,000 motor vehicle 1 $10,000 applicant\u2019s total individual assets $860,000 applicant\u2019s individual liabilities credit card debt $3,000 applicant\u2019s total individual assets less liabilities $857,000 respondent\u2019s individual assets k street, suburb l $680,000 motor vehicle 2 sale proceeds from d street, suburb e $100,000 respondent\u2019s total individual assets: $790,000 respondent\u2019s individual liabilities mortgage on k street, suburb l property $99,622 loan from ms b $30,000 respondent\u2019s total individual liabilities $129,622 respondent\u2019s individual assets less liabilities: $660,378 total combined assets less liabilities $1,517,378 applicant\u2019s superannuation held with super fund m $104,503 respondent\u2019s superannuation held with super fund n $209,279 total superannuation $313,782 total combined assets less liabilities plus superannuation $1,831,160 41 the applicant conceded that her $3,000 credit card debt was accrued after separation and is not a relationship debt. 42 the applicant disputes the inclusion of a $30,000 loan the respondent claims he owes to his sister ms b for the stamp duty on the home he purchased at k street, suburb l, (\u201ck street, suburb l property\u201d). despite this the applicant did not cross examine ms b on this topic. given this i accept that the respondent owes his sister this debt. 43 the respondent sold the d street, suburb e property for $770,000 on 24 december 2020. he says he used the proceeds to pay his former lawyers and the mortgage. he used the rest of the proceeds to purchase the k street, suburb l property. he took out a mortgage for $100,000. he says that is the limit of his borrowing capacity because he is reliant on the disability support pension and prior to that was in receipt of job seeker payments. the respondent says that he was granted the disability support pension on 21 january 2021 after appealing an initial refusal. other contributions 44 the respondent says that when they started the relationship in 2001 they agreed to keep their finances separate as they met when they were older and wanted to keep their assets separate. he says the applicant kept the rental income from the f street, suburb g property and was also responsible for any expenses for the f street, suburb g property. 45 both parties were employed throughout the relationship. the parties kept their bank accounts separate for the entire period they lived together. 46 the applicant\u2019s youngest son remained living at the f street, suburb g property until he moved overseas in 2003. the applicant rented out the f street, suburb g property from 2003 until 2013. the applicant says there were leftover funds from rental income after the mortgage on the f street, suburb g property was paid and that those funds were used for the parties\u2019 joint benefit for things such as holidays, entertainment, and living expenses. 47 the respondent\u2019s counsel put to the applicant that while she was living with the respondent she was renting out her f street, suburb g property, which effectively was a small business on the side. the applicant responded stating that her contributions to the respondent\u2019s property and to the relationship would far exceed the rent that she received from the home. she also maintains that she contributed the proceeds of the rent to the relationship. 48 the respondent\u2019s counsel put to her that as she was renting a property whilst living with the respondent, she would have been liable for capital gains tax (\u201ccgt\u201d) upon sale of the f street, suburb g property. she initially said she did not pay cgt and then said she may have been liable for cgt. there is no evidence before me to establish whether or not she was not liable for cgt and that would depend on a number of factors. 49 the applicant says that at the beginning of the relationship she was earning about $65,000 as an educator. the tax assessments and returns she has produced show her income being considerably less for a significant proportion of the period they lived together. the applicant says that in 2014 she was 61 and at that point, she was working less and her income was variable from year to year. 50 the applicant was cross-examined about the income tax assessments and tax returns she produced which were tendered and marked as exhibit 1. she did not have tax returns and assessments for all of the years that she says covers the relationship. this is not a criticism as there is no obligation to keep these documents beyond five years and the relationship dates back considerably further than that. she does not have tax returns for the 2012 and 2013 financial years. her taxable income is shown the years produced as follows: (1) a notice of assessment for the year ending 30 june 2009 shows a taxable income of $33,763. she did not produce a tax return for that year. as a consequence, a breakdown of her income sources are not available. (2) a notice of assessment for the year ending 30 june 2010 shows a taxable income of $38,218, again without the tax return. the only figure available is for her total taxable income. (3) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2011 is $22,364. (4) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2014 is $17,727. the only figure available is for her total taxable income. (5) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2015 was $14,193. the only figure available is for her total taxable income. (6) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2016 was $20,858. her income was made up of earnings from casual work and the newstart allowance. (7) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2017 was $24,171. her income was made up of earnings from casual education work and the newstart allowance. (8) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2018 was $27,897. her income was made up of earnings from casual work and the newstart allowance. (9) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2019 was $23,403. her income was made up of earnings from casual work, the newstart allowance and age pension for that year. a notice of assessment for the year ending 30 june 2009 shows a taxable income of $33,763. she did not produce a tax return for that year. as a consequence, a breakdown of her income sources are not available. (2) a notice of assessment for the year ending 30 june 2010 shows a taxable income of $38,218, again without the tax return. the only figure available is for her total taxable income. (3) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2011 is $22,364. (4) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2014 is $17,727. the only figure available is for her total taxable income. (5) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2015 was $14,193. the only figure available is for her total taxable income. (6) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2016 was $20,858. her income was made up of earnings from casual work and the newstart allowance. (7) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2017 was $24,171. her income was made up of earnings from casual education work and the newstart allowance. (8) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2018 was $27,897. her income was made up of earnings from casual work and the newstart allowance. (9) her taxable income for the year ending 30 june 2019 was $23,403. her income was made up of earnings from casual work, the newstart allowance and age pension for that year. 51 according to the applicant\u2019s evidence, the f street, suburb g property was rented between 2003 and 2013. her 2011 income tax return does not indicate any rent being claimed for that year. it is not possible to know whether or not she claimed rental incomes that year without the review of the actual returns for 2009-2010. when cross-examined, the applicant was unsure about the periods she received rent. 52 the applicant says the f street, suburb g property was damaged by tenants on several occasions and it was necessary for her and her children to clean and restore the property after the tenants vacated. the applicant incurred costs for repairs. the respondent says he had nothing to do with the f street, suburb g property and did not contribute financially or by undertaking any work to the property. the applicant conceded that she would have been required to pay for utilities on the f street, suburb g property during the periods it was not occupied by a tenant. the applicant complains about this but it is consistent with the respondent\u2019s evidence as to the arrangements they agreed to. 53 the applicant paid out the modest $60,000 mortgage on the f street, suburb g property in 2013 by accessing her superannuation entitlements when she turned 60. 54 the applicant sold the f street, suburb g property in 2014 and bought the property at h street, town j. she agreed that she had to pay rates and body corporate fees for that property. she said they would have been approximately $3,000 per annum. she also had utilities. during this period her income was as low as $17,000. in her trial affidavit she referred to needing to support her children\u2019s complex medical needs. it is unclear as to whether this refers to financial support or support more generally. 55 the applicant agreed that when she retired and started claiming the age pension. she also told centrelink she was living at h street, town j, and whenever she had to attend centrelink in person she went to the town o office. 56 in 2002, the respondent bought a property at p street, suburb e with his sister ms b. the parties lived in the property for about two years. whilst it was being renovated, the applicant says that she provided significant assistance with respect to the renovations of that property, and says that her assistance increased the value of the property. this is an assertion only and is not supported by evidence. it is common for parties to make this type of argument. however, renovations to a property do not automatically improve its value and expert evidence in the form of a valuation is required. such valuation evidence would be needed to assess the value of the property before the renovations were carried out and after they were carried out. it cannot be assumed that an increase in value of the home has occurred over time is necessarily attributed to renovation work, though of course, it would increase the value in certain circumstances. 57 the respondent and his sister sold the p street, suburb e property and bought the d street, suburb e property for $235,000. the property was purchased in the respondent\u2019s name and he paid the deposit. the parties moved into that property and the applicant rented the f street, suburb g property between 2003 and 2013 before selling it. 58 in her trial affidavit, the applicant refers to several renovations to the d street, suburb e property that she says she assisted with over the years. she claims to have made payments for various items for the renovations. the respondent disputes this and says that if she paid for things it was without his knowledge and authorisation. 59 the respondent\u2019s sister ms b gave evidence in support of the respondent. in her affidavit she says that she met the applicant in about 2002 when the respondent told her that she was staying with him. she said she understood their relationship to be one of companionship. she confirmed that the applicant did not contribute to the purchase of the p street, suburb e property that she and the respondent bought in 2001. the respondent\u2019s brother mr q lived in the property. ms b referred to the renovations carried out on the property and said that she and the respondent agreed to renovate the property and draw down $20,000 from the mortgage in order to pay for those renovations. she says that the applicant did not contribute to the costs of renovations. 60 in cross-examination, the applicant conceded that she had never made any payments for the mortgage on the d street, suburb e property. 61 i accept that the applicant made financial and non-financial contributions, as did the respondent. i find that the applicant has exaggerated the extent of her contributions, particularly with respect to renovations of the d street, suburb e property and financial support she alleges she provided generally, in order to strengthen her claim for property adjustment orders. if the tax returns and assessments she has produced are accurate, then there are several years where her income was very modest. she was incurring costs from the h street, town j property, which she did not rent out as well as paying for living expenses for the parties. it appears that it was only during the pre-2014 period that the applicant was earning a higher income and was receiving rental income. the fact that she did not rent out the h street, town j property and spent at least part of the time living there is consistent with the nature of their relationship changing after 2013. 62 the respondent agreed when cross-examined by the applicant that she had suggested to him that rather than deciding on splitting bills, she would pay for his food and he paid for the bills and that was the agreement. he denied that renovating the house and contributing to those renovations was part of that agreement and maintained this position that she bought some things without his knowledge and did not help with the renovations to the extent that she claimed. he agreed that at no stage during the relationship did he financially support her. she asked him about periods of unemployment and low employment. he said that he was working casually to make ends meet and denied needing her assistance. he agreed that their financial arrangement did not change in 2013. 63 i also accept that she contributed to household expenses and bought groceries etc. and that she did not and the respondent did not require her to pay him rent. the parties kept the costs associated with their respective properties completely separate. as she was living in the respondent\u2019s home she was able to rent out her home. i do not know how much rent she received and what she did with it. length of de facto relationship 64 the respondent says that in 2013 the parties separated under one roof and from that point on they slept in separate bedrooms. in his trial affidavit, the respondent says the applicant told him the relationship was over and they would no longer have sex. he further says that towards the end of their relationship, the applicant was experiencing menopausal symptoms and was disinterested in sexual affairs. the applicant did not cross-examine the respondent with respect to this. the respondent says their friendship deteriorated from 2013 to 2019 and says they did not go to functions as a couple but attended some events as friends. 65 the applicant contends that there was no change in their relationship in 2013. the applicant claims the parties continued to have a sexual relationship after 2013. she says they slept in separate bedrooms from that time because of his sleep apnoea and the noise of the cpap machine he has to use. 66 the applicant relied on the affidavit of her adult daughter ms r who was cross-examined. in her affidavit she refers to the applicant continuing to provide support and care for herself and her brothers. ms r and her brother mr s both suffer from medical disorders. she says that her father never provided any emotional or financial support and her parents separated when she was 9. she claims that she saw her mother and the respondent together. she claims that she saw her mother take on all the work and responsibility of maintaining both the f street, suburb g property and d street, suburb e property without the respondent\u2019s assistance. she makes general statements and does not provide the basis for those statements. when cross-examined she conceded that she did not live with them. she stayed with them for a couple of days recovering from an operation. 67 understandably, ms r is keen to support her mother\u2019s case. parts of her affidavit are vague and are not based on her direct observations. 68 the applicant annexes several photos to her affidavit which she says supports her contention that the de facto relationship continued after 2013. these include photos of them at christmas and other occasions. she also tendered several text messages from 2019 which refer to the respondent asking about what she was making for dinner and referring to her in affectionate terms. 69 the applicant cross-examined the respondent\u2019s sister, ms b. ms b said that she was close to her brother before he met the applicant and that they remained close until the applicant moved into the d street, suburb e property. ms b said that she did not see her brother from that time until around 2013. she said that the respondent never really commented on his relationship with the applicant and only referred to her as a \u201cboarder\u201d. the applicant questioned ms b about paragraph 11 of her affidavit, which says she knows the romantic relationship had ceased. ms b responded that this was because her brother started visiting her again and also said that from that time he started complaining about wanting the applicant to leave the house. she also said the applicant was aware that the respondent wanted to sell and move to a smaller house for some time. 70 ms b says that after they sold p street, suburb e street property and the respondent purchased the d street, suburb e property, the respondent told her that the applicant would not be paying board. she refers to seeing the respondent at her niece ms t\u2019s wedding in 2013 and her niece ms u\u2019s wedding in 2017 and says that the applicant attended as the respondent\u2019s friend and was not introduced as his partner. 71 the applicant claims that the parties split their time between the h street, town j property and the d street, suburb e street property. she says she would go a day or two earlier or return a day or two later than the respondent at times, but that they spent considerable time at h street, town j together, particularly on weekends when the respondent would work in the local area. 72 the respondent says that the applicant increasingly spent longer periods of time alone at the h street, town j property and that he did not know when she would come or go from his d street, suburb e property. when questioned about this, the applicant said that potentially may have been the case in the past year and that the respondent was quite resentful about her coming and going. 73 the applicant was cross-examined about her allegations as to the breakdown of the relationship. the applicant refers to the respondent having a dispute with their neighbour at the d street, suburb e property in november 2019 with respect to renovations the neighbour was carrying out that was encroaching on their land and the confrontation which occurred between them, led to an intervention order being taken out by the neighbour against the respondent. the applicant says she was upset about this incident and on 14 november 2019 stayed at the h street, town j property. she said she had been injured after falling when walking her son\u2019s dog and needed a rest break and was also worried about her daughter who was unwell. 74 the applicant says the respondent travelled to h street, town j on 22 november 2019 and stayed overnight. she says she became upset when he told her that his sister ms b wanted him to sell the d street, suburb e property and planned to assist with the sale. she claims that the respondent asked her if she was going to return to the d street, suburb e property and alleges that she would not unless he told his sister to stop interfering in their relationship and that she complained to him that the decision to sell the d street, suburb e property should have been a joint one. the applicant also claimed that she told him that she wanted to see a solicitor and formalise their relationship and join the finances. she agreed that he gave her his key to the h street, town j property at that point. she conceded that she did not include this in her affidavit because she did not think the way they separated was relevant. 75 the respondent\u2019s counsel challenged her about this evidence suggesting that it was somewhat opportunistic to give this evidence now knowing that the issue of declaring their relationship status to the ato is an important matter. she disagreed and said that \u201ceverybody knows that when you receive the aged pension the house you own is an asset and you have to live there.\u201d this statement is self-serving and underscores the difficulty with accepting her evidence because she was either willing to lie to government agencies for years for financial advantage or lie to the court. none of her tax returns refer to having a de facto spouse. 76 the applicant accepts the relationship was over on 26 november 2019 when ms b changed the locks on the d street, suburb e property at the respondent\u2019s request. 77 when asked if she told the ato that she was in a relationship with the respondent the applicant replied no and when asked why not, she said she did not know she had to and was keen to say that the respondent also claimed to be single. her evidence is difficult to accept. taxpayers are obliged to indicate whether or not they have a spouse, either married or de facto, as this can affect the offsets and tax a taxpayer is liable to pay. the respondent\u2019s counsel then suggested this was because she was single. she rejected that proposition. the fact that the respondent claimed to be single on his tax returns is entirely consistent with his case that they were not in a de facto relationship. the applicant conceded that she recorded the h street, town j property as her residential address on her tax returns and not the d street, suburb e address. when questioned about this, she said she lived part of the time at h street, town j and part of the time in melbourne during the 2017/2018 year she was cross-examined about. 78 the applicant cross-examined the respondent about several text exchanges marked as exhibit 2, which took place throughout mid-late 2019. those text messages include exchanges about what the applicant was going to make for dinner and also refers to her washing his clothes. when the applicant asked the respondent if somebody renting would normally wash someone else\u2019s clothes he said yes. this is not credible. it is suggestive of their relationship being more than housemates or friends. 79 the respondent agreed that they both suffered from health issues during the time they lived together and provided each other with care after those issues. the respondent had an operation on his foot and the applicant had a minor stroke. 80 the respondent denied having any knowledge of the applicant needing to live at h street, town j in order to qualify for the aged pension. he also denied their having any discussions about retirement and denied that they talked about buying a house together. he says for a long time he had been looking to downsize and they had talked about him buying a house in town v. she asked him if he did the house work and gardening when she was not there and he said no, and clarified that as a single guy he would do his dishes and occasionally cut the grass. she also cross-examined the respondent about the medical reports annexed to his affidavit and his seeing psychologists in early 2020 and mentions dr w referring to their marriage breakdown. the respondent said that there were a lot of things happening at that time in his life, including the ivo involving the next-door neighbour and that he discussed these various matters and general things with his psychologist. 81 the respondent denied the applicant\u2019s suggestion that his financial circumstances changed greatly after she left which is why he had to sell the d street, suburb e property. the respondent said that he had health issues, was unemployed, and had been wanting to downsize for some time. relevant section 90sf(3) factors 82 the applicant acknowledges that the respondent had polio as a child and that he has post-polio syndrome. she says during the relationship he was working full time and was doing casual work on weekends. the respondent outlines the various jobs he had from 2001 to 2020. he does not give any evidence as to what income he earnt. the respondent says that his physical and mental health declined in 2020. the fact that the respondent qualified for the disability support pension is indicative of his having a long term mental and/or physical disability, such that he is entitled to the disability support pension, which is paid at a higher rate than the jobseeker payment. his current financial statement does not disclose any income earned from casual work which is consistent with his deteriorating health. i am not satisfied that he is currently earning additional income as a casual worker. there is no dispute that he was earning income from casual work during the relationship, but that was well before he qualified for the disability support pension. 83 the applicant is 68 years old and receives the aged pension. when cross-examined she said she did not think she was well enough to work part-time, and that education had changed significantly during the covid-19 period. given the applicant\u2019s age, it is reasonable for her to be retired. 84 the income that they receive from their pensions is similar. the respondent is 8 years younger than the applicant, but given his entitlement to the disability support pension, any earning capacity would be very limited. 85 turning to the parties\u2019 assets, liabilities and financial resources, the applicant has the unencumbered property at h street, town j and her superannuation. the respondent has his home subject to mortgage and his superannuation. were the parties in a de facto relationship after 2013? 86 the respondent had a poor memory when cross-examined, despite this his evidence was consistent. in both her written and oral evidence, the applicant was keen to state her case. somewhat simplistically, though understandably, she looks at the parties\u2019 respective initial contributions and says she brought in 75% of the assets at the commencement of the relationship. she compares their respective financial position now and says it is unfair to leave the parties in their respective financial positions because he is comparatively better off than she is compared to their respective starting positions. whilst it is understandable that a lay person would take this approach is it not how the law applies the principles with respect to property adjustment under the act. i did not find her to be a credible witness and am satisfied that she exaggerated parts of her evidence. her representations about her relationship status to centrelink and the ato also significantly undermine her argument to the court that the parties were in a de facto relationship. 87 whilst i am satisfied that the parties continued to have some sort of relationship after 2013 and which ended in 2019, i am not satisfied that it was a de facto relationship. relationships can take many different forms and some are not as easily defined as others. the nature of a relationship can also change over time and go through many different stages. the parties were not merely housemates as, if this were the case, one would expect that the applicant would pay rent or board. the domestic chores the applicant continued to undertake including washing the respondent\u2019s clothes is more than what a housemate would ordinarily do. 88 whilst the parties had a common residence after 2013, from the time the applicant purchased the h street, town j property, she declared that property as her principal place of residence and also held herself out to be single. these representations to centrelink and the ato would have affected her entitlements to income tested pensions and her tax liabilities whilst the parties maintained some sort of relationship. i think it is more likely that increasingly the applicant spent more and more time at the h street, town j property alone. the applicant denied being in a relationship when applying for centrelink payments and when filing her tax returns for a number of years. whilst she is keen to point out that the respondent did the same, as noted earlier, the critical difference is that the respondent\u2019s actions are consistent with his case that they were not in a de facto relationship. 89 they did not continue to have a sexual relationship. the parties deliberately kept their finances separate. they never shared bank accounts and conducted themselves with the understanding that the applicant\u2019s property at f street, suburb g and then h street, town j was hers alone. she was responsible for any costs associated with it and any income she received from the period the respondent was solely responsible for the mortgage and other expenses associated with the d street, suburb e property. i am satisfied that the applicant did not contribute to those expenses but did contribute to the parties\u2019 living expenses. i am satisfied that she would have paid a greater proportion of these expenses, noting that she remained in the property rent-free. the parties did not acquire any property together during their relationship, noting that the applicant sold the f street, suburb g property and purchased the h street, town j property in her sole name. 90 i am not satisfied that there is evidence to show that the parties had a degree of mutual commitment to a shared life. i accept that they attended various family functions and functions of friends together as shown in the photographs the applicant annexes to her affidavit, and which is not denied by the respondent, but i am not satisfied that they attended as a de facto couple with respect to public aspects of their relationship. should there be any adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests out of time? 91 being satisfied that the parties were not in a de facto relationship after 2013, i must consider whether or not the applicant should be granted leave to proceed out of time with her property application and as such, whether there should be any adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests. 92 as the threshold and substantive property application were heard together, my conclusions with respect to the substantive application inform the application for leave. both parties had assets at the beginning of the relationship. the de facto relationship ended in 2013, being a relationship of 12 years. when the parties separated they remained living in the respondent\u2019s d street, suburb e property. 93 the applicant rented her f street, suburb g property during the relationship and afterwards sold that property and bought the h street, town j property, which gradually became her primary residence. both during the de facto relationship and the years that followed, the parties kept their financial assets separate. 94 the parties\u2019 respective financial positions today are such that both have their own home. the applicant is mortgage free. as a result of the orders i shall make, the respondent will have a modest mortgage. both receive similar income benefits and this is unlikely to change. in considering whether to grant leave out of time, it is necessary to look at the scope of the applicant\u2019s claim to determine if hardship would be suffered. the respondent\u2019s position is that they should keep the assets already in their possession and control. if no property adjustment is made, then the applicant has 56% of the non-superannuation pool and 33% of the superannuation pool and the respondent has 44% of the non-superannuation pool and 67% of the superannuation pool. the applicant seeks that the respondent pay her $100,000, and that they otherwise keep their assets, liabilities and financial resources. this payment would result in a 7% adjustment in favour of the applicant. 95 in all of the circumstances, noting that the applicant will retain $961,503 including superannuation and the respondent $929,657 also including superannuation, i am not satisfied that it would be just and equitable to make any adjustment to the parties\u2019 property interests. given this, the applicant will not suffer hardship if her leave is not granted. 96 i am satisfied that the applicant\u2019s initiating application should be dismissed. as i explained even if i was satisfied that the de facto relationship continued until 2019, i am not satisfied that it would be just and equitable to make any adjustment of the parties\u2019 property interests. associate: dated: 9 november 2021", "metadata": {"filename": "116.txt", "size": 53702, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 54071, "document_id":

[ms m] said in her oral evidence that [t] continues to express fear of the father. she considered that [t]\u2019s fear is based on her actual experience but, as noted, she could not exclude the possibility that her problems are due to an over-load of information about the adult dispute from the mother. as indicated, i am satisfied that the mother has burdened t inappropriately with such material. examples are [t]\u2019s references to the sale of the former matrimonial home, the mother\u2019s attendance at \u2018the divorcion\u2019 and lies being told about the mother by friends of the father in the present proceedings. ... there is no doubt that [t] currently expresses strong opposition to and fear of spending time with the father. there could be any number of reasons why she is so oppositional and fearful but i am satisfied that she is genuinely frightened by the prospect of spending time with the father. it seems to me that [t] experienced a chronically frightening, stressful environment in the family home prior to her parents\u2019 separation. no doubt she was scared by some of the father\u2019s behaviour, as indeed would have been the case with some of the mother\u2019s conduct. in my view, it is significant that she has been spoken to by jirt officers and [ms m] about the father\u2019s alleged behaviour toward her since the separation. she was present when the mother discussed with [ms m] her intention to have the father charged with breach of the apprehended violence order. she gave evidence in the avo proceedings but, according to [ms m], she became too distressed to continue that process. in these circumstances, it is hardly surprising that she is currently fearful of the father.[1] i took [x] to the toilet, and after he finished having a wee, he was waving his penis around and thrusting his pelvis back and forth. i asked what he was doing. he said, \u2018this is what [mr d] does in front of me\u2019. the icl\u2019s submissions the law ...as has frequently been emphasised interim parenting proceedings, and orders made as a consequence, are a necessary but temporary measure until all the evidence can be tested, evaluated and weighed at a final hearing by the making of final parenting orders. decisions judicial officers have to make in interim proceedings are difficult and, often for very good reason, a conservative approach, or one which is likely to avoid harm to a child is adopted. this is often to the understandable distress of a party who may not achieve the outcome he or she desires, or thinks to be in the best interests of their child or children. interim parenting orders are frequently modified or changed after a final hearing, and any allocation of parental responsibility made at an interim hearing is disregarded at the final hearing (s 61db).[2] in our view, findings made at an interim hearing should be couched with great circumspection, no matter how firmly a judge\u2019s intuition may suggest that the finding will be borne out after a full testing of the evidence.[3] the intuition involved in decision-making concerning children is arguably of even greater importance when a judge is obliged to make interim decisions following a hearing at which time constraints prevent the evidence being tested. apart from relying upon the uncontroversial or agreed facts, a judge will sometimes have little alternative than to weigh the probabilities of competing claims and the likely impact on children in the event that a controversial assertion is acted upon or rejected. it is not always feasible when dealing with the immediate welfare of children simply to ignore an assertion because its accuracy has been put in issue.[4] as would be immediately apparent, this approach enables the court to appropriately and carefully deal with contentious issues relevant to the welfare of the child, and for those issues to not be ignored.[5] childs best interests: the s60cc factors lilley] acknowledged he has been verbally abusive on the telephone and has sent verbally abusive text messages to [ms gabor] when she has requested changes in spend time arrangements. the assessment of risk is an evidence-based conclusion and is not discretionary. the statement to the contrary by the full court in bant & clayton [2019] famcafc 198, (2019) flc 93-924 at [52] is rejected as being incorrect. sometimes it can be difficult to discern the difference between the exercise of discretion and an evaluative judgment ..., though a discretionary decision is one in which no single factor or combination of considerations will necessarily dictate the result .... the finding about whether an unacceptable risk exists, based on known facts and circumstances, is either open on the evidence or it is not. it is only the overall judgment, expressed in the form of orders made in the children\u2019s best interests, which entails an exercise of discretion. that discretionary judgment is influenced by the various material considerations enumerated within s.60cc of the act, of which the evidence-based finding made about the existence of any unacceptable risk of harm is but one.[10]

(2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged. credit of the parties and reliability of the evidence ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events... [citations omitted] ] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32 (\u201ccarlson\u201d) at [165] to [169] kent j made the following observations concerning the making of adverse credit findings against a parent in a parenting case: 5] as a general proposition, civil courts usually refrain from specific adverse credit findings against litigants if the disposition of the case can legitimately be achieved otherwise. there are good reasons for that approach. for example, a specific finding that a litigant has misled the court might be tantamount to a finding of perjury. further, it can be accepted as a given that human beings have the capacity to reconstruct or rationalise or even misconstrue past events or conduct, or to engage in self-justification, particularly in recounting events in highly emotive settings or in respect of highly emotive issues. this may make the distinction between an honest, although wrong, account on the one hand, and a deliberate and calculated obfuscation on the other, difficult to draw. ... [169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide. ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to. some significant events and controversies i [the father] promise to do these following commitments:- 1/ i will not threat [the mother] in any scenario till my death. 2/ i have no share in any of [the mother\u2019s] assets. 3/ i will pay monthly $1000 to [the mother] to look after my son [the child] till my p.r. (permanent ressidence) 4/ i will not contact anyone of my wifes family members, in any circumstances 5/ i will not see him and not bother him i have no share in my wife [the mother\u2019s] assets including car, house and bank accounts under her name. i do not owe any money to [the mother] now. parenting family law act provisions 60ca: child's best interests paramount consideration in making a parenting order in deciding whether to make a particular parenting order in relation to a child, a court must regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration. ... 60cc how a court determines what is in a child's best interests determining child's best interests (1) subject to subsection (5), in determining what is in the child's best interests, the court must consider the matters set out in subsections (2) and (3). primary considerations (2) the primary considerations are: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child's parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence.

interfering with the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties to the marriage and whatever may have been their stated or unstated assumptions and agreements about property interest during the continuance of the marriage. [42] in many cases where an application is made for property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice by made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife. no less importantly, the express implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship... and the assumption that any adjustment of those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4), the parties\u2019 property cases the father\u2019s property case ... [the mother] and i opened a joint bank account in early 2016. before that time, we each operated our own bank accounts, although [the mother] always had access to my bank account. i on the other hand never had access to [the mother\u2019s] bank account. [the mother] used to take my bank card when she would purchase groceries and buy other things for the family. when we opened the joint bank account we did so following our legally registered marriage and in anticipation of the birth of [the child]. [the mother] and i spoke about establishing a strong financial position before the birth of our son. [the mother] suggested that both our salaries should be deposited into the joint bank account. i agreed and changed my bank details with [the transport company] so that my income was paid to the joint account. whilst both our salaries were deposited into the joint account, [the mother\u2019s] salary was transferred by her to her own separate account. my salary was used to pay all familial expenses, including rent and all other expenses. i did not make any issue about [the mother] transferring her income from the joint account to her own bank account. she always said that in her view and islamically speaking, it was my responsibility to look after the family and that her income belonged to her solely. i did not argue and accepted her views. i have never disregarded my responsibility to provide for the family, however i believe that [the mother] was financially controlling and abusive. at no time during our relationship did i shy away from paying familial expenses, however, [the mother] always tried to add pressure by bringing up my religious and cultural responsibility towards meeting all the familial expenses. ... in or about [early] 2017 i decided that it would be best for me to leave our house rather than continue to fight and live with [the mother\u2019s] behaviour. i noted that our lease was ending in about [mid]-2017 and i asked [the mother] whether she wanted to continue it or move out after that time. [the mother] said that she would make arrangements in [mid]-2017. at that time i had no idea that [the mother] was planning to purchase a property, or already had bought a property. ... when the lease expired in [mid]-2017, i moved out. it was about [early] 2017 that i discovered that [the mother] had in fact bought a property. she at that stage suggested that we would move together to this property. at first i was shocked to hear that [the mother] had purchased a property without any discussion with me. i was also surprised as to how she could have come up with the deposit. however, i was happy to know that we would finally be homeowners and that [the child] would have a proper home. i was still hoping at that time that [the mother] and i could fix our relationship and that the separation under the same roof would allow us to re-assess what we each wanted, hoping that we could re-unite and focus on [the child]. ... [the mother] deposes to the circumstances in which she allegedly purchased the property. in about [early] 2017 just before final separation, [the mother] withdrew all of the savings from our joint bank account. these savings totalled $19,000. ... [the mother] also took $6000 in cash around [early] 2017. i had saved this money at home in my bedroom draw next to my bed. i had saved this sum over a period of about 6 months. ms wiener: thank you, your honour. firstly, can i say this: this was a combination of two people who were working hard in a joint enterprise to try and build up a nest for their family. and that is, despite what my friend might say to the contrary, both parties were working hard. we readily concede, your honour, that the respondent was working hard during the marriage as was my client, despite what my friend might say about him, you know, allegedly sneaking around and sleeping all day. that\u2019s, in my submission, not the evidence. he worked as a [transport worker]. he worked in the [business]. he had a [motor vehicle]. he did everything he could to try and support the family. it\u2019s unfortunate that the [business] didn\u2019t pan out, but he picked himself up, got the [transport] licence and, again, most unfortunate that he had the accident, the car is written off and then of course he goes overseas. ... ms wiener: ... there\u2019s no substance to the argument that they weren\u2019t conducting themselves, as it were, as a joint enterprise for the betterment of the two of them, not jointly [and] severally, but for the betterment of the two of them as a unit, whilst they were together. albeit that they had separate accounts. that\u2019s not unusual and some people may say it\u2019s prudent, your honour, for various reasons. and in my submission, the only inference \u2013 the only appropriate inference your honour can draw is that the wife in these proceedings was either able to save the deposit for the house because my client was paying many other expenses... [in] any event, your honour, in my submission, it\u2019s fanciful for the wife to say i\u2019ve paid all the expenses but i\u2019m still able to save up all this money. it just doesn\u2019t pan out, your honour, in my submission. and yes, your honour \u2013 yes, it\u2019s a small pool. yes, [since] separation she has been making the contributions by way of mortgage and so forth. ... ms wiener: ... the wife maintains that she can\u2019t borrow. that, you know, to use the emotive phrase, i will lose the house and be on the street. but the reality is she was able to refinance. she was able to get a loan and paid off her car and repaying [mr p] from whom she had borrowed money. so it cannot be out of the question for her to again refinance and pay out my client. ... ms wiener: ... in my submission your honour should make an order. in my submission it\u2019s appropriate. it would be just and equitable to make an order. yes, it\u2019s a small pool but a small pool in and of itself doesn\u2019t mean that there shouldn\u2019t be an order. my client made contributions and those contributions should be recognised, in my submission. his honour: yes. thank you. ms wiener: and there\u2019s simply no evidence that she can\u2019t borrow, because she hasn\u2019t made those inquiries. ... his honour: and in terms of post-separation contribution, is it open to me to find \u2013 if i were to find it\u2019s just and equitable to make an order, that [the mother\u2019s] contribution as homemaker and parent in difficult circumstances with [the child], as well as night duty, that post separation, her contribution is greater than [the father\u2019s]? ms wiener: it is, your honour. ... ms wiener: ... i am instructed as to one other thing i should mention. my client has, of course, remarried and has, of course, the responsibility of a wife and a child and the child is an australian citizen. so that is responsibilities that he has which, of course, your honour is obliged to consider under the act. the mother\u2019s property case property available to the parties at separation section 79(2) \u2013 whether it is just and equitable to make property orders assets mother\u2019s pool $ father\u2019s pool $ the property (in m\u2019s sole name) mortgage debt approximate equity mortgage debt approximate equity approximate equity 495,000 (298,000) 197,000 8,000) 197,000 197,000 $495,000 ($298,000) 197,000 98,000) 197,000 mother\u2019s motor vehicle 1 20,000 father\u2019s motor vehicle 2 2,000 $5,000 total other liabilities mother\u2019s loan from mr p 8,000) nil mother\u2019s hecs debt 8,077) not included mother\u2019s unpaid legal fees ,032) addbacks refinance of mortgage in 2018 $50,000 cash transfers to country f by m ($55,926 + $7375) 5,926 + $7375) $63,301 superannuation mother\u2019s super fund 1 $61,092 father\u2019s superannuation $3,886 conclusion associate: dated: 6 october 2023 dated: 6 october 2023 [1] the father\u2019s affidavit filed 21 october 2021, [142] to [143].[2] the mother\u2019s affidavit filed 14 february 2020, [64].[3] tp \u2013 99.

[z] complained of having a \"sore head\u201d. [y] confirmed [z]'s version of events, saying \"dad was angry because [z] stood on his foot. dad's face went red, he yelled and swore and hit [z]'s head and [z]'s head went into the wall.\" [in late] 2022, [ms b] spoke to me about [z]'s disclosure and told me \"[z]'s told me [mr corbin] struck him, have you heard about this?\" i said, \"yes.\" i then explained to [ms b] what [z] had said to me. [ms b] is a [community worker]. she said \"i'm going to make a report to [...]\".[4] ... going back to the mother\u2019s state of mind or her reasonableness at the time that this occurred, all she knew was that the children made these disclosures to her and then to police, and then she received a caution or a copy of the caution where there\u2019s an unspecified \u2013 sorry, an admission to clipping [z] over the head on an unspecified date. count 2 count 4 on 14 october 2022, the children were due to spend three nights with me from after school pursuant to order 5.4.1 of the orders. at 2:11 pm i received a message from [ms corbin] stating: \"[x], [y] and [z] have chosen not to attend your house this weekend. as a first step at reconciliation how about we trial wednesday after school until thursday before school this week as a one night starting point. i will attach a medical certificate for this weekend\". at this time, [x] was aged 11, [y] was aged 10 and [z] was aged 7. it is my view that they were and are too young to decide whether or not to see me. at 4:20pm, [ms corbin] sent a medical certificate on talking parents for [x] only (not [y] and [z]), in the same terms as the previous certificates, covering the period 14 october 2022 until 17 october 2022. she did not make the children available to spend time with me that weekend. i did not receive any contact from [ms corbin] regarding make-up time. i called [dr d] that evening to ask why a medical certificate had been issued. [dr d] said \"all three children presented for an appointment with [ms corbin] today. [x] presented with anxiety and said she didn't want to go, so i signed a medical certificate for her. the boys did not say that they didn't want to go, so i did not provide a medical certificate for them\". he also said \"[ms corbin] said that you didn't come to handover on 1 october 2022 which is why they didn't spend time with you on the holidays and that this caused the children anxiety\". as outlined above, this is untrue and was very upsetting to me. i said to [dr d] \"this is the fourth time you have provided a medical certificate for anxiety and depression with no referral for professional services. please can a referral be made.\u201d[6] (emphasis added) counts 6, 8 and 10 , however, has refused to and has not spent any time with [mr corbin] since [late] 2022. i have formed the view that [x]'s behaviour and her response when i have forced her to see her father was so distressing to [x] that it put [x]'s psychological well-being at risk. when i tell [x] that she needs to spend time with her father, she becomes hysterical, cries, and insists that she is not feeling well. [x] is well aware of the dates that she is schedule to spend with [mr corbin] and refuses to go to school on changeover dates. she does this by hiding at home, saying she 's unwell, and refusing to get into the car to go to school. to get [x] to go see her father i have to physically carry and drag her to [mr corbin]. i have done this to [x] in the past when she was younger. [x] was 7 to 9 years old during the previous proceedings, during which, to facilitate changeovers, i had to carry her, put her into the car and lock her in the car to drive her to see her father. even with this routine, i could not always get [x] to see her father and to avoid missing changeover times completely often left with just [y] and [z] and brought them to see their father. now that [x] is 12 years old and much bigger, i can no longer use physical force to bring [x] to school or changeovers against her wishes. [x] is now 150cm tall and approximately 45kg and i can no longer physically pick her up and carry her to the car.[7] psychological pathology - counselling nil harm potential - exclusion of emergency referral nil psychotic features counselling counsellor referral consider trial of stay with father \u2013 then call for collection if intolerance[8] count 9 there was an occasion [in] november 2022 where [y] was dysregulated, so i did not provide [y] on that date. on that day, [y] was so stressed that he experienced an \"autistic shutdown\". he wrapped himself in his blanket and cuddled his dogs. [y] was unresponsive and i could not get through to him at this point.[11] ... [y] was particularly dysregulated [in] november 2022. this dysregulation was evidenced by [y] shutting down and wrapping himself around the dog, curled up in a ball and unable to process any communication from me.[12] i collected [z] from school and started heading to [the] shops to collect [y]. before leaving the school carpark i received a message from [ms corbin\u2019s] whatsapp at 3:19pm saying \"i will not be attending you for the weekend. [y] \".[13] communication count 5 generally, i facilitate audio-visual contact between the children and [mr corbin] by giving one of the children my mobile phone during a whatsapp call from [mr corbin]. the other children are also at home during these calls. on 17 october 2022 at 6 :45pm, i facilitated an audio-visual call between the children and [mr corbin] via my whatsapp account. i gave the phone to [z] on this occasion and he had a call with [x]. [x] and [y] were also home but declined to speak to [mr corbin] that day. i say it is not reasonable for [mr corbin] to expect that all three children are present for every single audio-visual call between him and the children, which occur once per week. during the calls it is very difficult to get all three of them to engage at the same time, so i usually ask that one child holds the phone (or has it in front of them) and talks to their father. the children then take it in turns between them in accordance with their wishes. if one child wants to spend the entire time talking to [mr corbin] and this is ok with the other children, i do not take the phone away from that child and force the other two to speak to [mr corbin] instead.[15] (emphasis added) counsel for [mr corbin]: you don\u2019t tell us what you said to [x] and [y] that day. do you remember? [mr corbin]: not specifically on that occasion, but i know that i regularly prepare them before the phone call is about to start and let them know that it\u2019s almost time to speak to dad, you know, \u201cfive minutes to go. finish up what you\u2019re doing. come and get ready. dad is now on the phone. dad is talking to [z]. come and join the phone call\u201d \u2013 that sort of thing. counsel for [mr corbin]: yes, yes, so you think, in general, that\u2019s probably what happened on that occasion, but you\u2019re not sure? [mr corbin]: yes, that\u2019s \u2013 yes. counsel for [mr corbin]: okay. so you have no recollection of saying to them, \u201ccome and talk to your dad\u201d? [mr corbin]: not \u2013 i don\u2019t remember that day specifically, but i know that that is what i always say to them. counsel for [mr corbin]: yes. so, certainly with [y], if you look back at that time, you could have convinced him to come and talk to his dad, couldn\u2019t you? [mr corbin]: that\u2019s really variable, as my son has autism spectrum disorder and he has really good days and he has not so good days. counsel for [mr corbin]: and [x] \u2013 once again, you have no recollection of that particular date? [mr corbin]: not that specific date, no. counts 3 and 7 i do not recall exactly what happened [in] october 2022 but recall that it was on the children\u2019s first day back at school, [mr corbin] called twice, and i spent a long period of time after [mr corbin]\u2019s first call telling the children to pick up the phone and speak to their father. i put the phone in front of them and said \"it's dad on the phone. please answer\". they refused. i note that this was about 2 weeks after [mr corbin]\u2019s assault of [z]. i say it is not possible to force the children to engage in the audio-visual calls if they refuse to talk to [mr corbin]. even if i pick up the call and place the phone in front of the children, if they do not want to speak to [mr corbin] they would refuse to talk, hang up the phone or leave the room. i note [mr corbin] deposes at paragraph 14 of his affidavit he has missed 130 of 160 audio-visual calls with the children. i deny that figure and say that i have encouraged the children to participate in all of the calls pursuant to the orders and that the children have participated in the majority of those calls. i say that there were less than 10 calls which all of the children missed.[18] i do not recall exactly what happened [in] october 2022 but recalled that [mr corbin] called twice and i was not successful in convincing any of the children in picking up the phone.[19] relief sought associate: dated: 9 october 2023 dated: 9 october 2023 [1] family law act 1975 (cth) ss 70naf(1).

[in] october 2021 until mid january i contacted the mother on many occasions regarding kindergarten. the mother said she can not afford it. i enrolled [y] and said i would pay for it. i contacted the mother to attempt to arrange for [y] to attend a government funded 4 year old kindergarten program. i researched and suggested three kindergarten centres in our local area where other children attending are likely to attend the same primary school. his older brother had no friends when he started school. annexed hereto and marked \"7\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. the mother was very dismissive of me, yet together, [y] had a great outcome. annexure kindergarten. given [y]'s speech delay, i felt strongly that attending kindergarten would be necessary and beneficial for him. a kindergarten close to his school where he would have friends attend. given over 98% of australian children attend 4 year old kinder, i don't believe i was being unreasonable. i had previously requested communication with the mother to plan [y]'s pre-school years and speech delay and, as usual, received an extremely dismissive response. annexed hereto and marked \"7\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. the mother insisted that [y] continue to attend the day care facility in [suburb c]. i then took steps to enrol [y] in a kindergarten program near my house where i would be able to take him when he was in my care. i did not agree to [y] attending this day-care. it is far away and not supportive of me as father who has equal and shared responsibility. annexed hereto and marked \"7\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. i have not filed a contravention for these breaches, though i will if this continues. the mother promptly responded with anger, however she did agree to send [y] to a different kindergarten program closer to the children's school. i agreed and [y] commenced at [town d]. a perfect outcome in my opinion. annexed hereto and marked \"7\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. i am shocked that the mother is now filing a contravention against me in this matter and requesting sole parental responsibility be given to her. i feel it is neglectful to refuse to send a four year old child with a speech delay to kindergarten. [y] was being forced to sleep for two hours everyday at day-care. [y] did not like it and i did not want [y] attending a day-care program prior to attending school where he is being forced to sleep. [y] did not like it and said he was staring at the ceiling the whole time. the mother did not care and said all the children are sleeping. if i hadn't taken action to enrol [y] in kinder in 2022 he would not have attended and the mother and father, including the mother's parents would not have benefited from the program. annexed hereto and marked \"7\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. please refer count 1 and paragraphs 33-38 of the mother's affidavit, given that i sought communication from the mother regarding kindergarten on a number of occasions and that it is a generally accepted position that 4 year old children attend kinder, i firmly believe that my action to enrol [y] in kinder is not a contravention. annexed hereto and marked \"7\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten. given the mother and father enrolled [y] at [town d], close to his school, proves that the mother is able to co-parent if she chooses to. annexed hereto and marked \"7\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [y]'s kindergarten.[5] counts 2 & 3 counts 9, 10, 16 & 17 count 18 each party shall advise the other by way of the \u2018our family wizard\u2019 app as soon as practicable of any illness suffered by the children, and any emergency relating to the children, including evidence of medical treatment received.[8] counts 21 & 22 once again, the mother believes the father is unable to care for the children which is disrespectful. .... the mother's affidavit and annexures evidence that i tried to arrange drop off times. the mother created confusion and was difficult to communicate with and then files a contravention, when it was her who created the uncertainty in where i should take the children. she often changes the location of changeover to suit her whereabouts which i never know until the last minute.[12] count 26 count 28 after the judge created new orders so the children could be aligned. unfortunately, the children were still mis-aligned and the mother was unable to agree to allow the children to be aligned. it makes me very upset the mother deliberately causes harm and distress to the children. i am not sure why and am unable to explain why she does this. i agreed to her proposal because she would not agree to allow the children to be together. i agreed to minimise conflict. only to cause conflict and contraventions.[13] count 31 this highlights the mother would rather the children by in daycare against professionals advice to keep children home given there are 50, 000 covid cases a day. the mother's dis-respect and disdain towards the father as an equal parent is evident. her actions are not in the children's best interest. the mother would rather the children suffer than allow the children to have a meaningful relationship with the father.[14] count 32 count 36 evidence the father explains to the mother the children are unwell. she dismisses and disregards the comment. files a contravention. it's fabricated to create a contravention.[16] counts 45, 46 & 47 count 48 count 49 it's very disrespectful and demeaning of the mother not allow the children to say goodbye to their father. the mother grabbed the children and hurried them away from their father. i am not sure why she would not sign [x] in. only to try and make the father look incompetent.[17] count 50 yes, [x] was upset that the mother is abusive! i spent some time explaining to [x] it's okay to return to his mother. i explained to the mother, if she abuses [x] again, i will be involving child protection! thankfully the mother's abuse lies in the grey area. still causing emotional and psychological harm. i note the children will have to learn to cope with their mother's mental health issues. shaving [x]'s head when he has long hair and wants to grow it longer. and forcing him to have a hair cut everytime she takes him to [town g]. i was disgusted to hear he was carried in by both the mother and grandmother, kicking and screaming. i am appalled and it breaks my heart to know this happens and there's nothing i can do. i had to revoke the ivo to minimise the harm caused by the mother. [x] is [hundreds of] kms away from home in a small country town where this abuse occurs. hereto and marked \"12\" is a true copy of correspondence regarding [x] repeatedly getting a hair cut agianst his will and often after he's had a haircut in the fathers care.[18] relief sought ultimately the judicial role is to determine the proceedings on the material presented to the court. it is not an investigative body conducting an inquisition but rather it is an adjudicative body determining a dispute that is brought before it.[30] primary considerations the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with both of their parents the need to protect the children from physical or psychological harm or from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence additional considerations any views expressed by the children and any factors (such as their maturity or level of understanding) that are relevant to the weight to be given to their views the nature of the children\u2019s relationships with each of their parents and other people, including any grandparent or other relative the extent to which each of the children\u2019s parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues in relation to the children, to spend time with the children, and to communicate with them the extent to which each of the children\u2019s parents has fulfilled or failed to fulfil their obligations to maintain the children the likely effect of any changes in the children\u2019s circumstances, including the likely effect on the children of any separation from either of their parents, or any other child or other person, including grandparent or other relative, with whom they have been living the practical difficulty and expense of the children spending time with and communicating with a parent and whether that difficulty or expense will substantially affect the children\u2019s right to maintain personal relations and direct contact with both parents on a regular basis the capacity of each of the children\u2019s parents and any other person, including any grandparent or other relative of the children, to provide for the needs of the children, including emotional and intellectual needs the father's non-compliance with the orders is also affecting the children in a profound way and i am concerned for their well-being. the children are exposed to inconsistency around changeover arrangements. the father does not seem to understand that they need consistency and routine. [x] is especially sensitive to the effects of overholding and makes excuses for his father, including suggesting that it is his fault he is late returning. the children's behaviour has deteriorated and become more difficult to manage. they come home to me often irritable and argumentative.[39] the mother refuses to take [x] to extra-curricular activities. this includes [sports activities]. i have had to choose sports the children can participate in which do not require the mother's co-operation. in 2022 and now again in 2023, [x] has only been able to play and train in [sports] every second week during his father's time. the mother refuses to take him. i do not know how long this can last and i feel this behaviour is irrational and detrimental to [x]. if the children's time with their father is reduced they will miss out on a wide range of activities that the father organises. the mother pulled [x] out of [sports] because i was taking him during my time. the mother did not believe i should be allowed to take the children during my time. this irrational behaviour is not only against court orders but has a negative impact on the children. i have not filed a contravention for these breaches, though i will if this continues. [x] continues to play [sports], however it is disappointing that he can only play and train every second week. i encourage these activities to help with [x]'s social and focus skills. i have enrolled the children in [sports], [extra] classes are allowed for the week when they are with their mother and i have been able to take them twice during my time.[40] ...for the last two and a half years, the mother has been giving x] a haircut and [y] up in [town g], and [y] has said to me that he doesn\u2019t want to get his hair cut \u2013 like, he\u2019s getting really, really upset. one time, i had given him a haircut that he really liked, and then he went into his mother\u2019s care a couple of days later. the mother has then gone and shaved his head off and \u2013 and shaved it off to number 1, and he was absolutely traumatised. ... ...every single school holidays, he has been forced to get his hair cut. i called \u2013 [x] was very upset, very distressed. i called the hairdresser in [town g], and she explained to me. she said, \u201cyes, i noticed that the mother was carrying [x] in kicking and screaming to get a haircut.\u201d she goes, \u201che clearly didn\u2019t want a haircut. but then when he left, the grandma \u2013 and grandma talked him into getting a haircut.\u201d [x] told me that the mum said, \u201cif you don\u2019t get your hair cut, you won\u2019t be allowed to watch your tablet for the whole time that you\u2019re at the farm and for the whole trip home.\u201d fast forward to the first term holidays, she gave him a haircut again, and he was very distressed. two weeks prior to the end of second term ending, i was called into a meeting at the school with four teachers \u2013 two of his classroom teachers, the wellbeing coordinator, and the vice principal \u2013 and they all said to me, \u201ccan you please explain why [x] is in the classroom cutting his hair every day\u201d, and i said that he\u2019s \u2013 i know he\u2019s traumatised by getting his hair cut, and then when i spoke to [x] he said he was cutting his hair every day because he wanted to show everyone that, \u201chey, my hair doesn\u2019t grow.\u201d if [x] does get another hair cur against his will. or by coercing, manipulation, bullying or anyway that is considered familiy violence, by you or other members of your family. i will be reporting this to child protection services and any agencies or professionals necessary to ensure this child abuse stops.[42] the children were very, very traumatised, your honour. they \u2013 they didn\u2019t want to go back to their mum. they \u2013 they were saying that they hated their mum. they said they don\u2019t want to go back to the [house]. i was trying to counsel them. i got them to call the kids helpline to try and counsel them. because i was concerned for the boys\u2019 wellbeing. i was hoping that, yes, it \u2013 she could maybe try and empathise with the \u2013 with the boys. no. taking the boys \u2013 making the report is me noticing that i \u2013 i believe that \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s an ongoing thing and it\u2019s not a one-off thing, and it\u2019s repeated all the time, and it\u2019s really affecting [x]'s \u2013 really affecting [x]. he\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s getting into fights at school, he\u2019s \u2013 he\u2019s getting bullied at school. the maturity, sex, lifestyle and background (including lifestyle, culture and traditions) of the children and of either of their parents, and any other relevant characteristics of the children if the children are aboriginal children or torres strait islander children, their right to enjoy his or her aboriginal or torres strait islander culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture), and the likely impact any proposed parenting order will have on that right the attitude to the children, and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the children\u2019s parents as a result of the father overholding the children, i wait for long periods of time, with little or no information regarding when or where the children will be available for changeover. i am unable to leave my home to work, study, attend to household errands or plan for any social outings on changeover days. if compulsory work or educational commitments coincide with changeover days, due to the uncertainty that the father's behaviour creates, i get extremely stressed. i have to manage that stress as well as meet my responsibilities. i find that i am distracted and unable to fully focus on my work or study. ... the situation has become so bad that i have had to take a leave of absence from [work], change jobs at the end of 2021, and alter the way in which i schedule aspects of my personal life and the children's appointments or extracurricular activities to mitigate the chance of overholding impacting on both mine and the children's lives. i have experienced significant levels of emotional distress and my physical health has also been impacted. i suffer with frequent colds and viral infections. my [medical condition] and associated condition has become unstable. i feel a deep sense of despair that the father ignores the orders which perpetuates the conflict between us.[43] any family violence involving the children or a member of their family if a family violence order applies, or has applied, to the children or a member of their family, any relevant inferences that can be drawn from the order, taking into account the nature of the

weekend with them where it\u2019s \u2013 you know, a week would have a \u2013 a routine with the father, a routine with the mother, they would have a meaningful relationship with the mother. they would have a meaningful relationship with the father. associate: dated: 9 october 2023 dated: 9 october 2023 [1] family law act 1975 (cth) ss 70naf(1).[2] bain & bain (deceased) [2017] famcafc 80;

[mr c] specifically refers to payments made \u201cdirectly\u201d to [ms brisset] and says no payments were made directly to her from 2020. it is not clear if [mr c] intends to convey that indirect payments have been made. such payments would be those to [ms brisset]\u2019s related entities and that not reportable in her own personal tax returns. it is submitted [ms brisset]\u2019s tax returns would not show cash distributions made to her where such payments are not taxable income of the trust and, therefore, not taxable income in [ms brisset]\u2019s hands, as a taxpayer. such distributions could conceivably include: a. trust corpus. b. asset revaluation reserves. c. realised gain reserves. tax free capital gains (from the sale of assets acquired prior to september 1985). capital gain discounts (the 50% of a capital gain which is not taxable if the asset has been held for longer than twelve months). summary dismissal \u2013the law the court may make a decree for one party against another in relation to the whole or any part of the proceedings if: (a) the first party is prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings, and (b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings. the first party is prosecuting the proceedings or that part of the proceedings, and (b) the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings. the court is satisfied that the other party has no reasonable prospect of successfully defending the proceedings or that part of the proceedings. a party may apply for summary orders after a response has been filed if the party claims, in relation to the application or response, that: the court has no jurisdiction, or (b) the other party has no legal capacity to apply for the orders sought, or (c) it is frivolous, vexatious or an abuse of process, or (d) there is no reasonable likelihood of success. 16. further, the plurality said: the determination of the issue must only take into account the material on which the respondent seeks to make out the case, or as often expressed takes the respondent\u2019s case \u201cat its highest\u201d unless the respondent\u2019s version is inherently incredible or unreliable (see munnings v australian government solicitor [1994] hca 65, (1994) 68 aljr 169 at 171, bigg & suzi [1998] famca 14, (1998) flc 92-799, webster v lampard [1993] hca 57, (1993) 177 clr 598 at 608). ... the primary judge at [53] also correctly referred to and cited from the judgment of kirby j in lindon v commonwealth (no 2) [1996] hca 14, (1996) 136 alr 251 at 255\u2013256, where his honour set out the approach to be taken in applications for summary relief, namely: it is a serious matter to deprive a person of access to the courts of law for it is there that the rule of law is upheld, including against government and other powerful interests. this is why relief, whether under o 26, r 18 or in the inherent jurisdiction of the court, is rarely and sparingly provided. to secure such relief, the party seeking it must show that it is clear, on the face of the opponent's documents, that the opponent lacks a reasonable cause of action or is advancing a claim that is clearly frivolous or vexatious. an opinion of the court that a case appears weak and such that it is unlikely to succeed is not, alone, sufficient to warrant summary termination. even a weak case is entitled to the time of a court. experience teaches that the concentration of attention, elaborated evidence and argument and extended time for reflection will sometimes turn an apparently unpromising cause into a successful judgment. summary relief of the kind provided for by o 26, r 18, for absence of a reasonable cause of action, is not a substitute for proceeding by way of demurrer. if there is a serious legal question to be determined, it should ordinarily be determined at a trial for the proof of facts may sometimes assist the judicial mind to understand and apply the law that is invoked and to do so in circumstances more conducive to deciding a real case involving actual litigants rather than one determined on imagined or assumed facts. if, notwithstanding the defects of pleadings, it appears that a party may have a reasonable cause of action which it has failed to put in proper form, a court will ordinarily allow that party to reframe its pleading. a question has arisen as to whether o 26, r 18 applies to part only of a pleading. however, it is unnecessary in this case to consider that question because the commonwealth's attack was upon the entirety of mr lindon's statement of claim. the guiding principle is, as stated in o 26, r 18(2), doing what is just. if it is clear that proceedings within the concept of the pleading under scrutiny are doomed to fail, the court should dismiss the action to protect the defendant from being further troubled, to save the plaintiff from further costs and disappointment and to relieve the court of the burden of further wasted time which could be devoted to the determination of claims which have legal merit.

(emphasis added) consideration the beneficiary of a non-exhaustive discretionary trust who does not control the trustee directly or indirectly has a right to due consideration and to due administration of the trust but it is difficult to value those rights when the beneficiary has no present entitlement and may never have any entitlement to any part of the income or capital of the trust. (emphasis added) in the present case, there was no evidence presented to the primary judge as to what the value of such a right to \u201cdue consideration and due administration\u201d would be.[6] in the absence of evidence of any such value of the interest held by the first respondent, the primary judge, appropriately, in our view, excluded the trust property from the property pool but had regard to the trust assets as being a significant financial resource available to the first respondent. no error has been demonstrated on the part of the primary judge in taking that approach. in that respect, in shaw and shaw [1989] famca 29, (1989) flc 92-030 at 77,420, the full court said there was \u201ca degree of artificiality about attempting to assign a monetary value\u201d to a financial resource in circumstances where it was not possible to identify future events or decisions that would result in the financial resource being accessed by the party. a similar view was expressed by aldridge j in raine & creed [2013] famca 362 at [33]. for completeness, we make it clear that this case is not analogous to the facts of kennon v spry and we caution against giving the principles adumbrated in that case a legend beyond what were described as the \u201cunusual circumstances\u201d of that case (per kiefel j at [237] and french cj at [62]). (emphasis added) the husband\u2019s application to join mr c and the corporate trustee. 44.1 the proposed respondents \"may be directly affected by an issue in a proceeding\". [mr frederic] seeks to set aside the 16 june 2023 deed of variation and resignation. [mr frederic] seeks to set aside [ms brisset\u2019s] share transfer. the owner of that share is presently [mr c]. both [ms brisset] and [mr c] hold a belief the trust is solely [mr c\u2019s]. [ms brisset] refers to the trust as \"his trust\" (ie. [mr c]'s trust). [mr c] says the trust \"has always been my entity\" and says he \"treated it as such\". such a view runs contrary to the purpose of the trust and its terms noted in preamble to the trust deed at (a). 44.2 the proposed respondents \"participation in this proceeding is necessary\" for the court to determine all issues in dispute in the proceeding because if the proposed respondents are not joined, they will not be bound by the outcome determined by the court. put another way, if not a party, the proposed respondents are free to disregard whatever order is made by this court after trial. joinder - the law 10. the following are entitled to become a party to proceedings in which an application is made for an order under this section by a party to a marriage (the subject marriage ): ... any other person whose interests would be affected by the making of the order. 3.01. necessary parties a person whose rights may be directly affected by an issue in a proceeding, and whose participation as a party is necessary for the court to determine all issues in dispute in the proceeding, must be included as a party to the proceeding. where the orders sought, establish or recognise a proprietary or security interest in land, chattels or a monetary fund, all persons who have a claim or interest in the subject matter are necessary parties. this is because an order in favour of the claimant will, to a corresponding extent, be detrimental to all others who have or claim an interest. it does not matter whether a proposed party wishes to participate in a proceeding: arida v arida [2015] nswca 170, per sackville aja at [19] (with bell p and macfarlan ja agreeing). it is well settled that, applying these principles, it can be appropriate to join third parties to a marriage to proceedings in this court, for example, to bind them in respect of declarations as to property interests pursuant to s 78 or as ancillary to the exercise of discretion in s 79 or s 106b to set aside dispositions: valceski v valceski [2007] nswsc 440, (2007) 70 nswlr 36 at [31]\u2013[33], khalif & khalif (no 2) [2021] fedcfamc1f 308 at [37]. clearly, according to these principles, the existence of claims for orders affecting the rights or interests of third parties proposed to be joined usually compels the conclusion that those parties are \u201cnecessary\u201d. such joinder is, nonetheless, an exercise of the court\u2019s discretion. (emphasis added) ...something more than \u201cuseful\u201d or \u201cexpeditious\u201d. in my view, if there are available alternative means to joinder to the substantive proceedings, of obtaining from a third person or someone already a party what is needed to allow an applicant for joinder to establish an identified \u201ccase\u201d, joinder is unlikely to be \u201cnecessary\u201d. however, if a cause of action, recognisable at law, against a \u201cthird person\u201d is particularised, then it is at least highly likely that joinder will be \u201cnecessary for the court to completely and finally determine all matters in dispute.\u201d in hancock family memorial foundation ltd v fieldhouse [no 3] [2010] wasc 223, le miere j helpfully referred to relevant authorities and articulated, in precise terms, why it is necessary for a party seeking to join a third party to litigation to establish an arguable case, in the following terms: the applicant on a joinder application must show that there is an arguable case sufficient to resist the entry of summary judgment by the parties sought to be joined. it would be futile to order that a person be joined as a defendant if the material before the court disclosed that if the person, having been joined as a defendant, applied for summary judgment the application would succeed. (citations omitted)(emphasis added) the full court in b pty ltd and ors & k and anor [2008] famcafc 113, (2008) flc 93-380 held as follows: we do not accept that it is proper to allow joinder of third parties merely upon the formulation of a paragraph in, or to be added to, an application, on the basis that at trial facts to support the application may be asserted and proved. sufficient facts must be asserted to demonstrate that, if proved, the law arguably provides the relief sought. associate: dated: 10 october 2023 dated: 10 october 2023 [1] the husband\u2019s application in a proceeding filed 23 may 2023 seeks slightly differently constructed orders to those set out in his summary of argument [1] including joining \u2018any other persons or entities to obtain disclosure relevant to the current proceedings...\u2019 - which was not pressed at the time of the hearing.[2] frederic & brisset (federal circuit and family court of australia, lnc600/2022) commenced 14 september 2022.[3] response of ms brisset, filed 22 june 2023.[4] response of mr c, filed 18 september 2023.[5] amended initiating application, filed 29 august 2023 [1] \u2013 [3].

filing of this affidavit, my financial statement, my balance sheet and other documents has been delayed mainly by my inability, directly relating to my deteriorating health, to provide my current lawyers and barrister with information and documents they have requested to finalise the documents. i have spent the majority of the last 4 days at my lawyers office providing instructions and obtaining information to ensure that the contents of this affidavit, my financial statement and the balance sheet are as accurate as possible. the whole process has left me completely exhausted and at times i would fall asleep sitting in the chair in my lawyers office. as i am not computer literate and do not have at home, or if i do i can not find, any of the source documents required, my lawyers have had to contact other parties and/or undertake searches to ensure the financial and factual information i have set out in this affidavit is accurate. by way of example i attended upon [d bank] which is located one block from my lawyers office. i walked to and from the branch with the assistance of my cane. the walk to and from the branch took me approximately 40 minutes in total whereas a person in good health could walk to and from the branch from my lawyers office in 10 minutes. i lost my cane prior to arriving at my solicitors office. a secretarial member of staff drove me to the entry of [a shopping centre] and i slowly walked back. both those simple tasks of attending at the [d bank] branch left me completely exhausted. in addition, my eyesight has deteriorated to the point that even with reading glasses i have difficulty in reading any documents. corporate entities g pty ltd h pty ltd (in liquidation) in mid-2018, a liquidator was first appointed to h pty ltd, (b) in

to my kids so [ms scaletta] can't get anything when we separate\u201d. i then went back upstairs to the kitchen where [the husband] was seated near the kitchen. i saw a shocked look on [the husband\u2019s] face. i said to him words to the effect: \u201ci heard what you told [mr z]. i am very disappointed with you. i never thought you would do this to me.\u201d [the husband] said to me \u201ci did not say that to [mr z].\u201d i went to the bedroom. i was sitting on the bed crying and [the husband] walked in with a gun. he pointed the gun at my face. [the husband] said to me \u201cyou see this, you see this\u201d whilst pointing the gun in my face. i was very frightened and shaking. i froze. [the husband] then started to walk away and as he was walking away [the husband] said \u201ci will shoot myself.\u201d i closed the bedroom door. i called life line respect. they told me to leave the house and to call the police. i did not call the police as i was scared. i left [suburb c] and went to my sister [ms aa]\u2019s house in [suburb bb]. i lived with my sister for [several] months. during this period i found a job with the [cc company]. i also sought assistance from a psychologist as i was traumatized from the gun incident. whilst living at my sister's home, [the husband] tried to reconcile with me although i was reluctant to do so. i returned to live at [suburb c] with [the husband]. initially he was apologetic for the way he had treated me but then he became abusive toward me again and shouted abuse at me from time to time and would make me scared. prior to our separation i moved into the spare bedroom for some week until i left the marriage with only my clothes in [late] 2020 and when [the husband] kicked me out during another argument. [the husband] said to me words to the effect of \u201cyou stupid bitch get out.\u201d i sought treatment from my psychologist for a number of weeks. i remain traumatized by the gun incident. after we separated i moved in with my sister, [ms dd] and my brother-in-law [mr ee] in their home at [suburb bb] until i could find a place to live that i could afford. as well as moving in with them i sought help from a psychologist [ms ff] for about 3 sessions. i continued working [at] \u201c[cc company]\u201d. e husband]: \u201c...what did you do with the money i already gave you \u201c [the wife]: \u201ci spent it\u201d [the husband]: \u201con what? \u201c [the wife]: \u201cfood\u201d [the husband]: \u201cthat was $500, why do you need more money? \u201c i was unaware as to what [the wife] had done with monies i had given her, she had never accounted to me or provided receipts or details as to what had been purchased and except for conversation like that set out above, i did not ask her. it was not that kind of relationship. i deny that i ever said to her words concerning spending too much money or that the [the wife] said words to the effect that she had worked for me for no money all these years or that i told her to get out of the house. i do remember the argument and i do remember being very upset. i went to the [business] and drank excessively. later that day [the wife] came to the [business] because i could not unlock the car and i rang her up. she came to unlock the car. i do remember i was very drunk that night. i do not recall whether or not i had a conversation with [mr z] on that day concerning separation or transfer of assets. however, the house was then and still is in the name of [the wife] and could not be transferred without [the wife\u2019s] consent. the next morning, i was taken to hospital. [the wife] rang the ambulance to take me there. i refer to paragraph 40. this happened on the same day, that is the day before i went to hospital. i did have a gun which i had had from [previous employment]. i did not point the gun at [the wife]. i did say that i would shoot myself. i then left the house, never having pointed the gun at the [the wife]. i drove to [suburb gg] with the idea of shooting myself. i did not do so. i drove home. i put the gun in the glovebox of the car. i locked the car and left. i later discovered that the gun, a pistol, was missing from the glovebox and i presumed that [the wife] had removed it. i asked her, \u201cwhere is the gun?\u201d and she said, \u201ci took it\u201d. i repeat i never pointed the gun at her or threatened her with it. the threat was about myself. further with respect to paragraph 40, i have never pointed a gun at [the wife], i have never taken a firearm and used it to scare, harass or intimidate any person. [the wife] was becoming more and more anxious at that time and explosive in her communication. it was becoming difficult to talk to her as she would scream or make some sort of allegation about my conduct which was fabrication. i recall when an incident of this nature occurred, i would go to the bedroom and a conversation would take place to the following effect: [the husband]: \u201c...we need to think about this relationship. maybe we need some time apart. we need to change how you feel. you know i have been incredibly ill\u201d [the wife]: \u201ci can\u2019t cope anymore, i don 'i know why. i just can't. i'm going to stay with my sister for a while.\u201d no.... i\u2019m scared because i can\u2019t sleep. i\u2019m always crying, and i want to ask for help... i always hear the news the people that die, and there\u2019s a gun in my place, and that\u2019s what\u2019s always in my head. i\u2019m seeing it when i close my eyes. lease of business as consideration for the lessor's execution of this lease, the lessee agrees at its sole cost and expense to: diligently, properly and in a good and workmanlike manner perform any work required, engage certified and licenced contractors and seek any consent required from any public authorities to ensure the structural components in the premises is compliant with any and all codes, laws, and regulations relevant to the operation of a [business], including but not limited to purchasing, refurbishing and installing [fittings], dispensers and above and below ground [fittings], prior to the commencement of any construction of any of the lessee's work, submit to the lessor for approval a complete plan and specifications of the lessee's works, and refurbish, repair, maintain all structural components of the premises in a good and workmanlike manner every 10 years after the lease commencing date to keep the premises in a good and operational condition and [the] [h pty ltd business].

adjusted asset pool, taking into account the change in the parties\u2019 positions between the commencement of cohabitation and the conclusion of cohabitation. if in fact the asset pool has gone backwards over that time, then it is recognised that there would need to be an adjustment in favour of the wife to some extent, given the ten year relationship and the contributions which it is acknowledged that she did make. it is anticipated that this would equate to 10% of the combined asset pool. that is, combined assets of $5,333,642, less the [d bank] liability of approximately $500,000 leaving approximately $4,833,177, of which 15% equates to $724,976, with superannuation effectively cancelling itself out, given the relative equality of interests in superannuation. legal framework in property settlement proceedings, the court may make such order as it considers appropriate: in the case of proceedings with respect to the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them - altering the interests of the parties to the marriage in the property, [...] the court must not make an order under this section unless it is satisfied that, in all the circumstances, it is just and equitable to make the order. .] in considering what order (if any) should be made under this section in property settlement proceedings, the court must take into account: the financial contribution made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage, or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last\u2011mentioned property, whether or not that last\u2011mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, and (b) the contribution (other than a financial contribution) made directly or indirectly by or on behalf of a party to the marriage, or a child of the marriage to the acquisition, conservation or improvement of any of the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, or otherwise in relation to any of that last\u2011mentioned property, whether or not that last\u2011mentioned property has, since the making of the contribution, ceased to be the property of the parties to the marriage or either of them, and (c) the contribution made by a party to the marriage to the welfare of the family constituted by the parties to the marriage and any children of the marriage, including any contribution made in the capacity of homemaker or parent, and (d) the effect of any proposed order upon the earning capacity of either party to the marriage, and (e) the matters referred to in subsection 75(2) so far as they are relevant, and the judge called upon to decide proceedings of that kind is not entitled to do what has been described as \u2018palm tree justice\u2019. no doubt he is given a wide discretion, but he must exercise it in accordance with legal principles, including the principles which the act itself lays down. .] third, whether making a property settlement order is \u201cjust and equitable\u201d is not to be answered by beginning from the assumption that one or other party has the right to have the property of the parties divided between them or has the right to an interest in marital property which is fixed by reference to the various matters (including financial and other contributions) set out in s 79(4). the power to make a property settlement order must be exercised \u201cin accordance with legal principles, including the principles which the act itself lays down\u201d. to conclude that making an order is \u201cjust and equitable\u201d only because of and by reference to various matters in s 79(4), without a separate consideration of s 79(2), would be to conflate the statutory requirements and ignore the principles laid down by the act. in our opinion it is not so much a matter of erosion of contribution but a question of what weight is to be attached, in all the circumstances, to the initial contribution. it is necessary to weigh the initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. in the present case that use was a substantial contribution to the purchase price of the matrimonial home: see also campo and campo (unreported, full court (ellis, lindenmayer and finn jj), sydney, delivered 19 may 1995 at pages 21 and 22 of the joint judgment) and zahra and zahra (unreported, full court sydney, delivered 3

cases, may become common coinage in property cases and be used inappropriately as tactical weapons or for personal attacks and so return this court to fault and misconduct in property matters \u2013 a circumstance which proved so debilitating in the past. in addition there is the risk of substantial additional time and cost. ... it is essential to bear in mind the relatively narrow band of cases to which these considerations apply. to be relevant, it would be necessary to show that the conduct occurred during the course of the marriage and had discernible impact upon the contributions of the other party. it is not directed to conduct which does not have that effect... it has to be said, that their honours terms \u201cexceptional\u201d and \u201cnarrow\u201d lose much of their force if cases involving significant violence are to be the subject of the application of the principles. such cases might have been regarded as exceptional at the time kennon was decided but they cannot today be so regarded. unfortunately the prevalence of family violence is wide and artificial barriers to its recognition, such as trying to limit its recognition in property cases to exceptional or narrow cases, has no basis in principle. as i shall endeavour to explain shortly, the focus of the majority\u2019s reasoning was on the nature and quality of the contributions themselves which were not limited by such qualifying adjectives. 23. in kennon, the principle was identified as follows: put shortly, our view is that where there is a course of violent conduct by one party towards the other during the marriage which is demonstrated to have had a significant adverse impact upon that party\u2019s contributions to the marriage, or, put the other way, to have made his or her contributions significantly more arduous than they ought to have been, that is a fact which a trial judge is entitled to take into account in assessing the parties\u2019 respective contributions within s 79. for the reasons given, the words \u201csignificantly\u201d and \u201cmore arduous\u201d are not to be read as coterminous with \u201cexceptional\u201d. rather, they arise from the basis of the principle itself which focuses on contributions. if the nature and extent of a person\u2019s contributions are made more difficult or harder so that they should be accorded greater weight, such that they should be taken into account in the determining of the outcome, they have therefore been \u201csignificantly impacted\u201d or made \u201cmore arduous\u201d. the focus is not on the conduct per se, but on its effects on contributions. the threshold for recognition is therefore met by conduct which has a discernible effect on the contributions of the other party such that it should be recognised in determining the respective contributions of the parties. that, in my view, should be the focus and terms such as \u201cexceptional\u201d or \u201cnarrow\u201d, or indeed, \u201conerous\u201d add an unnecessary and unacceptable gloss suggesting that a rare and high level of impact is required and that the violence or its impact must be exceptional. that is not however, what their honours said. all that was required was a \u201csignificant adverse impact\u201d upon a party\u2019s contributions. the word \u201csignificant\u201d was used, in my opinion, as describing that the effect must be sufficient to warrant recognition but not imparting some artificial threshold. the effect of the conduct must be such that a greater weight should be given to the contributions. more recent cases have softened some of the harshness of the original application of the principles identified in kennon. for example, it is now the position that the adverse effect of the violence on the contributions of a party can be inferred from the lay evidence of the parties and that there is no need to call evidence to \u201cquantify\u201d that effect (maine & maine [2016] famcafc 270, (2016) 56 fam lr 500 at [47]\u2013[52] (\u201cmaine\u201d), britt & britt [2017] famcafc 27, (2017) flc 93-764 at [74]\u2013[75], keating & keating [2019] famcafc 46, (2019) flc 93-894 at [27]\u2013[43], [52]\u2013[67], benson & drury [2020] famcafc 303, (2020) flc 93-998 (\u201cbenson & drury\u201d) at [47]\u2013[50]). it seems to me that regarding kennon claims as \u201cspecial\u201d or \u201cexceptional\u201d is apt to mislead. in reality, all the majority said in that case was that a person\u2019s contributions are to be assessed in the light of all of the circumstances and where those circumstances have the effect of making the contributions more difficult, onerous or arduous, that should be recognised in the assessment of contributions. that, of course, takes place in a holistic manner (dickons v dickons [2012] famcafc 154, (2012) 50 fam lr 244, jabour & jabour [2019] famcafc 78, (2019) flc 93-898). the primary judge did not use those words. rather, her honour said \u201cthe wife\u2019s non-financial contributions were impacted and made more difficult and distressing\u201d (at [46]) and \u201cmore arduous\u201d (at [126]). they were found to be of such a nature so as to require consideration. i would not take that to be an incorrect application of the principles set out in kennon. the difficulty that arises in this matter is, however, that the primary judge did not explain how the acts of violence of the husband led to the non-financial contributions of the wife being made difficult, distressing and more arduous. the reasons are silent on the issue. in maine, the court held that the application of the principle in kennon \u201crequired of his honour findings in respect of evidence that addressed specifically... the impact that the violence had upon the wife\u2019s contributions\u201d (at [52]). the requisite finding could, as discussed, be inferred as explained in benson & drury at [50]. the husband submits that the absence of this discussion indicates that her honour did not understand and did not correctly apply the principles set out in kennon (ground 2(a)). alternatively, it is said that the failure itself is an error (ground 1(c), ground 2(b) and ground 3). i incline to the latter view, but either way, error has been demonstrated. whilst the events described by the wife were no doubt distressing, the evidence and the findings did not deal with the magnitude and extent of its effect. whilst matters can certainly be inferred, that inference must be properly based on the evidence before the court. here, the primary judge found the appellant perpetrated family violence upon the respondent and drew an inference that such violence did have an effect upon the respondent\u2019s contributions, making them \u201call the more arduous\u201d (at [162]). an inference is an assent to the existence of a fact which is based on the proven existence of some other fact or facts, drawn as part of the fact finding process as an exercise of ordinary powers of deduction and reason in the light of human experience, unaffected by any rule of law (g v h [1994] hca 48, (1994) 181 clr 387 at [4]). obviously, the strength of the subject inference depends upon the quality of the underlying evidence. it must be reasonable to draw the inference from primary facts. mere conjecture will not suffice (seltsam pty ltd v mcguiness (2000) 49 nswlr 262 at 275\u2013278 per spigelman cj, carr v baker [1936] nswstrp 20, (1936) 36 sr (nsw) 301 at 306\u2013307 per jordan cj). importantly, the evaluation of the evidence from which the subject inference is sought to be drawn should be thorough and balanced. in the context of a kennon argument, any factual controversies over the alleged misconduct of one spouse and its alleged deleterious consequential effects upon the other spouse should be resolved by familiar forensic techniques. disputed but untested allegations, are not facts (keating at [55]\u2013[66]). is there an incidence of family violence? should the conduct be recognised in determining contributions? i was scared because i can\u2019t sleep. i\u2019m always crying, and i want to ask for help... i always hear the news the people that die, and there\u2019s a gun in my place, and that\u2019s what\u2019s always in my head. i\u2019m seeing it when i close my eyes. section 79(4)(d): the effect of any proposed order upon the

children controlled by the wife item 8: wife\u2019s legal costs counsel for the husband: in your financial statement filed six weeks ago, you set out that your mortgage was $164,647.00, and today, six weeks later, your position to the court is that your mortgage is now $210,556.00. what\u2019s happened to the $46,000.00 or there abouts in the last six weeks? witness: in the last six weeks, i\u2019ve paid legal fees to my lawyer, i guess, so i put money into her trust account for barrister fees and the remaining amount is redraw across to my credit card over the last month to pay that account, and the remaining $500.00 would be the mortgage package fee that\u2019s just come through. counsel for the husband: of that amount, how much has been used to pay your lawyers? witness: so, i\u2019ve paid all family law close to $14,000.00 and put in trust for my barrister $25,000.00. counsel for the husband: and prior to the $14,000 you paid your solicitor, you\u2019ve previously paid solicitors\u2019 accounts, haven\u2019t you? witness: yes. counsel for the husband: and when you paid solicitors\u2019 accounts previously, was that drawn from the mortgage? witness: yes, most of the time. or actually, i think all of the time from memory. if that\u2019s my only source of income is that redraw facility, then it would\u2019ve definitely come from that. judge dickson: just to follow that up, am i entitled to assume then that all the costs referred to in your costs notice, all of those funds would have come from the mortgage redraw because that\u2019s your only source of income? witness: yes, outside of my um salary, my fortnightly salary.[37] item 12: monies advanced by the wife\u2019s parents the funds were advanced unsecured, (2) no interest has been paid in relation to

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 28 march 2023 federal circuit and family court of australia(division 2) egan & crisanti [2021] fedcfamc2f 341 orders the court orders that: reasons for judgment deputy chief judge mercuri: introduction background summary applicant\u2019s case at the commencement of our relationship [mr crisanti] made me sign a document identifying him as my landlord. i felt powerless to refuse his demands and so i signed that document. ... [mr crisanti] demanded i continued to receive centrelink payments throughout our relationship.[2] i only left the family home with the intention of permanently separating from [mr crisanti] on 3 may 2018. that was when i finally summoned sufficient courage to permanently leave [mr crisanti].[3] my financial circumstances are extremely dire and i am struggling to get by from week to week. the financial statement sworn by me and filed contemporaneously herewith is true and correct.[4] mr c he is a painter and in or about 2005, he was engaged by the applicant and the respondent to paint a property where they lived in town k,[8] (b) subsequently, in about 2006, he was again engaged to paint a new home they were having built in town g,[9] (c) the town g job took about eight weeks,[10] (d) during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11] subsequently, in about 2006, he was again engaged to paint a new home they were having built in town g,[9] (c) the town g job took about eight weeks,[10] (d) during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11] the town g job took about eight weeks,[10] (d) during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11] during that project both the applicant and the respondent were involved in choosing colours and finishes and gave directions as to the work to be carried out.[11] it was clear to me that [ms egan] and [mr crisanti] were in a domestic relationship given the way in which they both went about planning and building the town g property and instructing me of their requirements.[12] ...observed both female and male clothing being stored in the walk-in robe. the ensuite was also a shared area and it was clear and obvious to me that [ms egan] and [mr crisanti] were a couple and that they were cohabitating in that property together and sharing the master bedroom.[13] ... razorblades ... toothpaste, different toothbrushes, ladies makeup, men\u2019s shaving gear.... it looked like there was a man and a woman sharing a bathroom. ... so there was all that stuff i had to move in order to pain this ceiling ...[14] mr f ... i was lead to believe that they were (in a de facto relationship). ... i met [mr crisanti] back in 2008 or \u201909 around the bushfire time, and they were, - i went to [ms egan]\u2019s house with [ms l] because ... [ms egan] and [ms l] were friends, and because i was [ms l]\u2019s partner we went up there ... and it appeared to me that they were ... living together.[19] respondent\u2019s counsel: but the idea that they were in a de facto relationship rather than simply living together is just something that you\u2019re assuming, isn\u2019t it? [mr f]: well, it just seemed to me ... [ms egan] cooked ... his dinner and ... they had conversations about going away together. they had a timeshare and they went on holidays together. i mean, that seems a bit more than just \u2013 do you know what i mean. ... and [ms egan] said that she was with [mr crisanti] when she was only 21 or something ...[20] mr d throughout the years i saw both of the parties on numerous occasions working on the farm. they attended [work] meetings together. they went on a bus holiday to adelaide. i paid rental when it was due to either [ms egan] or [mr crisanti].[25] ms e i have no doubt in my mind that they were a genuine couple and presented to our community that they were a couple. the assertion made by [mr crisanti] that [ms egan] was a nanny is ridiculous.[27] they were in a relationship from the time i saw [ms egan] and started to speak with her at the school where my daughter went and [mr crisanti]\u2019s son and daughter went and i even thought they were her children at the time. ... and from that time on she was very proud to say that she was his fianc\u00e9.[28] mr b i did show concern for [ms egan] given her extremely poor health including mental health, even taking her to medical appointments at times when she was too unwell to drive. [mr b] has misconstrued the situation while [ms egan] is seeking to take advantage of that kindness.[38] respondent\u2019s counsel: isn\u2019t it fair to say that the basis of your belief about the nature of the relationship between [mr crisanti] and [ms egan] is derived, most of all, from your one-on-one counselling sessions with [ms egan]? [mr b]: yes. because it\u2019s certainly based on my experience and also based on the ... 30-odd sessions ... that i had with her over that period of time. i would say that she certainly believed, without question, that they were in a de facto relationship.[39] judge bender: but the discussion you had with ... [mr crisanti]... and he was speaking glowingly ... what was the context of that discussion? where were you? how did it come up? [mr b]: well, it was with my wife and i. we were having, i think afternoon tea. might have been even around at their house. and just visiting socially. and [mr crisanti] was quite, as i say, glowing in his praise of [ms egan]\u2019s work ethic, even to the point of helping him on the job as an [tradesman]. running cables through cramped spaces in rooves and that sort of thing. i can\u2019t recall him ever mentioning her role as a nanny. judge bender: how many discussions would you have had with [mr crisanti], either with [ms o] or just [mr crisanti]? [mr b]: ...it\u2019s hard to put a quantity on, but five to ten possibly.[40] respondent\u2019s case initially ... the applicant used the study as a bedroom. after approximately two years, the applicant began to sleep in the same bedroom as me. i then used the study for work. ... the physical aspect of the relationship was short-lived. thereafter the applicant continued to sleep in the same bed as me. we just slept beside one another with our backs turned. it did not worry me that the applicant was sleeping with me. we just didn\u2019t touch each other.[48] at the [u street] property, the applicant again slept in the same bed as me. there were not sufficient bedrooms for the applicant to have her own room. there were no sexual relations between us.[49] at the [town v] property, we slept in the same bedroom but once again, there were no sexual relations between us. the applicant and i had a lot of altercations at the [town v] property.[50] whereas the ([town g]) property initially comprised one bedroom, i then built extensions there, so that the property comprises three bedrooms plus a study. initially the applicant and i slept in the same bedroom at the (([town g]) property. this was due to the property only comprising one bedroom and bathroom. when the rest of the house was built, i then moved into one of the other bedrooms and slept separate from the applicant.[51] because she had an ensuite there and she had a wardrobe and she was comfortable. ... that\u2019s why. i respected her. ... and she slept there with her dog too in the bed.[53] no. i preferred to go down to that room. it\u2019s closer to my office and away from her.[54] from 1 january 2007, i regarded myself as living in a property with an enemy, and i was periodically very frightened for my safety. none of the former aspects of shared living remained, either in terms of sharing a bed, shopping, cooking or cleaning. mr p ms q mr s applicant\u2019s counsel: ... could you, from your observations, see any reason why he would need a housekeeper? [mr s]: yes, he\u2019s a hardworking [tradesman], and it\u2019s a large house, and ... i didn\u2019t see anything unusual about that [ms egan] was there as the housekeeper and gave her accommodation on that basis. ... applicant\u2019s counsel: did you see anything justifying why [mr crisanti] needed a housekeeper? [mr s]: yes, because she was a good cook, and he probably got used to having good meals cooked for him, his house kept, while he was off working in his profession.[58] there was never anything showed that they were a couple or had any affection towards one another at all, other than ... what i was told, that she was the housekeeper, and that was it.[60] ms r mr w\u2019s evidence other evidence relied upon engagement respondent: i broke off my engagement straightaway, within a month, after she told me of all her past and the events ... applicant\u2019s counsel: ...and how did you break it off, was it a formal announcement to the world? respondent: i just said ... that\u2019s the end, finished. applicant\u2019s counsel: yes but just to my client or to everyone else? respondent: ... everybody yes. applicant\u2019s counsel: ...so you communicated that to everybody? respondent: yes i did. all my friends, my family, yes.[67] applicant\u2019s role in the respondent\u2019s mother\u2019s funeral applicant\u2019s counsel: but you knew the pamphlet was being passed around to everybody? respondent: i didn\u2019t draw that up. applicant\u2019s counsel: but you knew it was being passed around? respondent: ... what did you want me to do? send it back on the day my mum was getting buried ... is that what you wanted me to do?...i\u2019m sorry but ... i was crying on the day. applicant\u2019s counsel: so you didn\u2019t do anything about it? respondent: no.[69] applicant\u2019s counsel: so how was she looking after your children when they\u2019re 25, and 23 years of age. respondent: she wasn\u2019t supposed to be with me. she was asked to leave, and she was still there. she wouldn\u2019t leave. she had nowhere to go. i felt sorry for her. applicant\u2019s counsel: you\u2019re not answering my question sir respondent: i am applicant\u2019s counsel: okay. i will ask you for the last time ... ... how do you say she was there at your mother\u2019s funeral in 2004 caring and looking after your children? how do you say that? respondent: she wasn\u2019t looking after my children then. she was there because she was still acting as a nanny. applicant\u2019s counsel: but a nanny for whom? respondent: she was acting as a nanny. she was my nanny and my housekeeper. applicant\u2019s counsel: okay. so she was a housekeeper at this stage, was she? respondent: she was a housekeeper because she wouldn\u2019t leave home, and we had come to an agreement \u2013 like i told you the last time, we had come to an agreement that if she kept the house clean and tidy, she could stay there, because she had nowhere to go. she was fighting with her family and had no friends. you may see that in one of the affidavits.[71] applicant\u2019s counsel: ... isn\u2019t that strange? do you find it strange [mr crisanti],\u2013 at this stage, my client\u2019s not a nanny, she\u2019s a housekeeper \u2013 that she\u2019s at your grandmother\u2019s funeral in 2004 and giving a eulogy as a family member?

[106] applicable legal principles working out if persons have a relationship as a couple ... it is also unnecessary for the disposition of this appeal ... to decide whether ... a finding of a de facto relationship could be made absent any of the indicia to which the section refers. of course to be a \u2018couple\u2019 it is necessary for there to be a mutual intention to have such a relationship. the effect of sub-s(5) on the determination of whether parties have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis is to import into it the understanding that a person can ... maintain two simultaneous relationships. that one of the parties asserted to have been in a de facto relationship was, at the same time, in another relationship, whether de facto or married, is a matter to be taken into account when considering the circumstances of the relationship and the indicia in s 4aa(2). however the fundamental question remains to be determined and now we turn to that. ... we must observe, however, that the appellant\u2019s emphasis on the words \u2018living together\u2019 imports a somewhat artificial focus. the matter for determination was not solely whether the parties were \u201cliving together\u201d at the relevant time. the court must find that they were \u2018as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis.\u2019 86 de facto relationships that broke down before commencement (1) subject to item 86a, parts viiiab and viiib and subsection 114(2a) of the new act do not apply in relation to a de facto relationship that broke down before

the [father] told the representative that he was going to go to the [mother\u2019s] residence and take his money back. he told the service representative \u201ci will fucking [hurt] her ... i will [hurt her] and [harm myself]\u201d. the [d authority] officer further confirmed with the [father] that he meant if they were to take more child support from him, he would go to the [mother\u2019s] residence and take it back and [hurt] her. the [father] confirmed this as his intention. about six minutes into this phone call, the [father] made further threats to the [d authority], stating \u201ci am going to [hurt] you. i am going to [hurt] you. i will bend you over and [hurt] you\u201d. this conversation continued with the [father] continuously threatening both the [mother] and the [d authority] officer. after about 15 minutes, the phone call was transferred to a social worker for further assistance. the [father] continued his threatening behaviour and told the support worker that he would [hurt] her and himself. the [father] told the social worker that he had [a weapon] and was outside the [mother\u2019s] residence and would attack police if confronted. the social worker became fearful for the [mother\u2019s] safety as well as her own and notified a coworker of the incident immediately. this co-worker called police, informing them he was at the [mother\u2019s] residence. a short time later, police attended the residence but were unable to locate the [father]. due to the nature of the threats and the belief that the [mother] was armed and intending to cause harm to the [father], an extensive search of the surrounding area was conducted. the [father] was unable to be located so a triangulation was conducted on the [father\u2019s] phone. at [5:00] pm, this triangulation showed the [father] was near the intersection of [e & f streets] in [suburb g]. this location is known to be close to the [father\u2019s] work address at \u2018[h company]\u2019 at [j

requirements of s 102na(2) apply to the cross-examination referred to in s 102na(1) of the act. however, the purpose of the legislation by which ss 102na and 102nb of the act were introduced into the act is made clear by the explanatory memorandum which accompanied that bill. the contents of the same included that: personal cross-examination by an alleged perpetrator can expose victims of family violence to re-traumatisation and can affect their ability to give clear evidence. it can also be problematic for victims to personally cross-examine their alleged perpetrator, due to the power imbalances created by family violence. ] that is, the purpose of the sections might be regarded as protecting the integrity of the litigation process by protecting against the potential that being cross-examined by a perpetrator of family violence can affect a victim\u2019s ability to give clear evidence, and also protecting against the possibility that, by virtue of the impacts of family violence, a victim may not be able adequately to cross-examine the perpetrator. consideration the contention of the father is also at odds with statements by superior courts that have examined the provision. see gill j in owen & owen [2020] famca 90, (2020) 60 fam lr 334 at paragraph [9]. the act has used the term, \u2018violence\u2019, in subsection (1)(c)(i), it has not used the term,

[x]stay in this house \". i am unsure as to why [x] thinks he will be taken from his home.[7] by the time he gets to my car, he\u2019s okay, yeah. he kind of switches off once he realises he\u2019s definitely coming, then he will start about the shade of, why is it the shade longer in winter, and you know, he switches like that. there is no dispute that [x] would benefit from having a meaningful relationship with each of his parent (sic). the pgps expressed clear support for this proposition.[9] the need to protect x from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence ms kozina\u2019s drug and alcohol abuse kozina] has been smoking cigarettes, 'from 15 years, up till current, on nicotine patch', she has been drinking alcohol, 'from 15 years, binges in weekends, got blackouts, sexually disinhibited, anger outbursts, drink 3-4 nights in a row, off 1 year\u2019, she has been smoking [an illicit drug], 'when 17-18 years, get paranoid, what's going on in the head, last 1.5 year ago', she was on [illicit drugs], get increased energy, feel busy, [illicit drugs], at 18-21 years, got psychotic at 18 years, got spiritual, knew what word, had deep thinking, was in [country l], would like it, then feel down', she was on [prescription medication], she was on [prescription medication], later replaced by ibuprofen and [prescription medication] dependence, on ibuprofen 200 mg+ [prescription medication], up to 60-80 tab/day, she was in rehab at [m centre], [suburb p], for 12 months, 'had 6 months residential rehab, 3 months transition, last 3 months as aftercare, finished last week, was hard, ,want to use yet keep off substance'.[12] ... accurate, except i notice that i\u2019ve haven\u2019t tried [prescription medication], i wasn\u2019t, i didn\u2019t know how to get, i didn\u2019t even know what [prescription medication] was back then. but that doesn\u2019t matter, it\u2019s all the same, it\u2019s addiction. i don\u2019t know where they got that from to tell you the truth, but that\u2019s okay, i don\u2019t know where they got that... i never misused [sleep medication]. .... some of this information i\u2019m hearing, i don\u2019t remember much. .... i don\u2019t abuse [sleep medication]. ... i don\u2019t abuse it, i take it to sleep. i am presently on [antidepressants and sleep medications]. i have been on these medications for about eight (8) years now, following treatment with a psychiatrist from [r centre]. i cannot now remember the psychiatrist's name.[14] a review of current medication particularly the amount of [sleep medication] [ms kozina] is currently prescribed. she is currently observed to be experiencing an over medicated presentation. after [ms kozina] takes her medication in the morning she becomes drowsy immediately, she appears disconnected, her memory is impacted and ability to focus is impaired. this also appears to be impacting her ability to attend to, and connect with her 5 year old daughter as well as impacting her ability to participate fully in our program.[15] on another occasion i attended the former matrimonial home to collect the children at an agreed time with [ms kozina]. [she] failed to answer the door and through the window i observed [her] to be slumped on the lounge in a state of undress and in a stupefied state. i entered the premises to observe beer bottles and other alcohol bottles scattered around the floor and rubbish scattered throughout the kitchen. i then found [x] running around the home inside unsupervised and unwashed.[16] ms kozina\u2019s mental health in or around 2007 i was diagnosed with adhd and [a mental health disorder]. following rehabilitation, that diagnosis was revised to adhd and [a mental health disorder].[17] she gave oral evidence that the affidavit is erroneous, and that she was only diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (\u201cadhd\u201d), in 2015. ntal health] disorder, features of adhd, panic disorder with agoraphobia, social anxiety, previous nicotine dependence, previous alcohol abuse, previous cannabis abuse, previous [illicit drugs] abuse, previous opioid dependence, and nsaid dependence, borderline personality traits.[18] she failed to disclose the other diagnoses in her affidavit material despite recalling in cross-examination having been diagnosed with those other conditions. in terms of adhd, she has had difficulties both in childhood and adult life, with difficulties with attention and concentration. she was very forgetful, bad a hot temper, was very impulsive, easily distracted and had problems with short-term memory.[21] so the one thing... the concentration and that is not too much. there\u2019s an issue i get also is where i\u2019m full on in the morning, i get what i need done, and then i crash, and i get exhausted easy. that is what i believe will be hard, but like i said, another reason why adhd medication works for people like me. she went on to give evidence that when she crashes, she does so for about four hours, and that she needs a \u201cnice big rest\u201d before starting a late shift at work. she described her need to crash as related to her chronic sleep problem, a problem she has always had. if i am struggling, i\u2019m big on pharmaceutical, because it\u2019s been big for me. um, i\u2019ll go back, talk to a psychiatrist, and you know, i know i didn\u2019t go and see a psychologist when they asked me to that time, that was in regards to work, i got over it. if i feel i need to, i\u2019ll take the time and do that as well. she needs individual therapy dealing with mood chart, grief and loss issue, sleep hygiene, dealing with negative thoughts, relaxation techniques, exposure therapy, mindfulness, stress tolerance, emotional regulation, inter-personal effectiveness, motivational interview with substance use.[22] i don\u2019t know, there was a lot going on i guess. look, i\u2019m a very different person today, so it\u2019s hard for me to go... um, i didn\u2019t stick to much. but, i can tell you one thing, in rehab, i was in there, for one of them, for a year, i had plenty of therapy. whatever ms kozina\u2019s perception of herself is, she remains non-compliant with recommendations for psychological intervention to treat her mental health conditions. additional considerations any views

so uncomfortable at first to come and live with me, so i was trying to avoid that, um... ... i didn\u2019t want to disrupt what he already had, i just wanted to add to his life, that\u2019s all. and

is making this proposal due to the current situation at [ms kade]\u2019s house (discussed in child safety and well- being section). when asked why he was proposing equal time if he thought [x] was at risk in [ms kade]\u2019s care, [mr bertram] said that he did not have a choice. he said that he did not believe that an order would be made for [x] to live with him. [mr bertram] stated that \u201ci have every right to him ([x]), i am his father.\u201d [mr bertram] stated that he did not want to be a part-time father. however, he said that whilst he did not want [x] to come from a broken home, there was no benefit to staying in a toxic relationship. ... ... ... [ms v] explained that she and [mr bertram] have a generally amicable and respectful relationship which helps when [x] spends time with him. she alleged that, however, there was one occasion (approximately six months prior to the interview) when she was five minutes late and \u201che lost it.\u201d [ms v] explained that [mr bertram] came to the car and \u201cjust kept going and going and going.\u201d [ms v] elaborated saying that [mr bertram] was telling her that [ms kade] was taking [x] away from him and that she ([ms v]) had \u201cobviously not read the court orders\u201d. [ms v] said that she was disturbed and nervous and she was unable to comprehend what he was saying. [ms v] said that she will now not allow [mr bertram] to treat her that way. [ms v] said that she facilitates the changeovers because she is concerned about [x] and because she lives with [ms kade] and [x] she \u201cput up with this\u201d to maintain the communication with [mr bertram]. [ms v] said that she still \u201cwait(s) for something,\u201d regarding [mr bertram]\u2019s abusive behaviour towards her. [ms v] said that she does not want to be put \u201cin a difficult position,\u201d as she was previously. [ms v] alleged that [mr bertram] is verbally abusive to [ms kade] in text messages and that [mr bertram] will only correspond with her ([ms v]). ... [ms kade]\u2019s primary concern about [x]\u2019s safety and well-being with [mr bertram] was that [mr bertram] was unable to accept [x]\u2019s diagnosis of autism. ... [ms kade] further expressed concern that because [mr bertram] does not support [x]\u2019s diagnosis that he does not follow the recommendations about behaviour management when [x] has a meltdown. [ms kade] explained that, during a changeover, [x] had a \u201cmeltdown\u201d and [x] was hitting and biting [mr bertram]. [ms kade] alleged that in response [mr bertram] told [x] that \u201cif you bite me i am going to bite you back\u201d and then [mr bertram] smacked [x]. ... [ms kade] said that the behaviour therapist does not want to engage with [mr bertram] due to his behaviour towards her (the therapist). [ms kade] said that she had tried to involve [mr bertram] but his behaviour had negatively affected [x]\u2019s ability to access treatment and therefore negatively affect [x]\u2019s well-being. she explained that the occupational therapist is well versed in [x]\u2019s needs and further, that [x] is comfortable with the occupational therapist. [ms kade] said that she seeks out assistance for [x] because she wants to see [x] live an independent life. [ms kade] said that [mr bertram]\u2019s behaviour towards [x]\u2019s therapists has resulted in her doing \u201cthe bad thing\u201d and keeping [mr bertram] from being involved in [x]\u2019s therapy. [ms kade] alleged that [mr bertram] tried to have [x]\u2019s access to ndis funding cancelled and her submitting a new application caused \u201ca lot\u201d of conflict between them. she said that [mr bertram] continues to assert that she has manipulated the therapists. [ms kade] stated that [mr bertram]\u2019s behaviour is impacting [x]\u2019s ability to access therapy. ... ... [mr bertram] and [ms kade] each reported that there was family violence in the relationship between them. due to the ongoing difficult relationship between [mr bertram] and [ms kade] this continues to impact the co\u2011parenting relationship between them. it appears that the reported physical abuse between each of them, regardless of the primary perpetrator, was of low intensity and lethality with each reporting that it consisted mainly of verbal abuse and throwing household objects. this continued negative relationship and verbal abuse in relation to [ms kade]\u2019s parenting is likely to affect her ability to meet [x]\u2019s needs and additionally, negatively affect the [x]\u2019s emotional and physical well-being. in this instance, [x] living with each parent equally would not be recommended. further to the reported family violence, it appears that [mr bertram]\u2019s and [ms kade]\u2019s parenting relationship is characterised by inconsistent communication (with the majority of the communication regarding [x] to be between [mr bertram] and [ms v]), limited trust in the other as a parent, and dispute regarding [x]\u2019s diagnosis and treatment. it appears that the poor parenting relationship between the parties is likely to have had a detrimental impact on [x], including him being exposed to the parental dispute regarding parenting arrangements and his treatment. this raises concerns that if this behaviour continues then [x] will continued to be exposed to parental conflict which is likely to have a detrimental impact on his psychological well-being. the apparent nature of the parenting relationship between the parties, combined with [mr bertram]\u2019s apparent negative views regarding [ms kade], and [mr bertram] dismissing the need for [x] to receive intervention for autism combined with the potentially detrimental impact of this on [x], contraindicates an equal time arrangement as being in the [x]\u2019s best interests. therefore, such an arrangement would not be recommended and it would be recommended that [x] live primarily with [ms kade]. given the assessed nature of the [x]\u2019s relationship with each parent, [x] is likely to benefit if the current arrangement stays stable and any changes made are done over a period of time because [x] is likely to find changes in his routine challenging, which may result in [x] experiencing emotional and/or behaviour difficulties. there are benefits to [x] having arrangements that conform to a set pattern, thus providing stability, consistency, and predictability for him. additionally, this arrangement is likely to provide some protection for [x] from the parental dispute. it would therefore be recommended that the current arrangements for [x] to spend time with [mr bertram] remain in place until [x] commences school. once [x] commences school it would be recommended that [x] spend time with [mr bertram], each alternate weekend, from friday afternoon until monday morning (with changeover occurring at school or a neutral venue if the school is closed), with provision for school holidays and days of celebration. [mr bertram] and [ms kade] do not have a co-operative co-parenting arrangement. this combined with a dispute over [x]\u2019s diagnosis raises concern that such an arrangement would not be able to be sustained by [mr bertram] and [ms kade] in the future. in the circumstances where the court finds that there is no veracity to [ms kade]\u2019s allegations about [mr bertram]\u2019s behaviour towards [x]\u2019s treatment team, then consideration could be given to [mr bertram] and [ms kade] sharing parental responsibility for [x]. in the circumstance that it is determined that [mr bertram] and [ms kade] share parental responsibility for [x], it would be recommended that they each participate in a multi-session parenting after separation course, such as [w program]. however, if the court finds veracity that [mr bertram] disagrees with [x]\u2019s diagnosis despite evidence to the contrary and has abused members of [x]\u2019s treatment team subsequently impacted [x]\u2019s ability to access suitable treatment, it would be recommended that [ms kade] have sole parental responsibility for [x]. the father engage with autism services to assist him in understanding the child\u2019s diagnosis and treatment recommendations, (b) the child live with the mother, (c) the child continue to spend time with the father as he does currently, until the child commences school, (d) when the child

informed of major decisions regarding the child and/or from the father obtaining information from the child\u2019s school about the child\u2019s progress. when the child commences school, that the child spend time with the father from friday afternoon until monday morning (the court interpolates here that it is clear from the whole of the family report writer\u2019s evidence, including her oral evidence, that she was proposing such time on a fortnightly basis), (e) the mother have sole parental responsibility for the child, to reduce the child\u2019s exposure to conflict over parenting arrangements and his treatment. it is recommended that this does not preclude the father from being informed of major decisions regarding the child and/or from the father obtaining information from the child\u2019s school about the child\u2019s progress. the mother have sole parental responsibility for the child, to reduce the child\u2019s exposure to conflict over parenting arrangements and his treatment. it is recommended that this does not preclude the father from being informed of major decisions regarding the child and/or from the father obtaining information from the child\u2019s school about the child\u2019s progress. tness] it\u2019s \u2013 it might \u2013 it\u2019s likely to make the mother feel very unsure of her ability to communicate with [mr bertram]. it \u2013 it would make communicating difficult if you were going to get derogatory terms or abuse back when you tried to communicate about the child. a child who\u2019s placed in \u2013 or exposed to parental conflict, or a parent that \u2013 well, a parental conflict is detrimental to a child\u2019s wellbeing. they can experience more depression, more anxiety, they can have difficulties with peer relationships, they can have trouble with sleep, and physiology. so they can get things like stomach aches, or headaches, or \u2013 or experience physical symptoms when they \u2013 when they\u2019re feeling anxious. they would also pick up on if the \u2013 their primary carer is anxious as well, and that can impact the level of care that\u2019s provided for that child, because they might be more irritable, they might lash out more themselves. so there \u2013 there\u2019s a number of things that could happen if conflict and abuse is ongoing in a co-parenting relationship. tness] not accepting a \u2013 a diagnosis, or continually dismissing information about the child, is going to make the co-parenting relationship contentious...raising a neurodivergent child has additional challenges to a neurotypical child, and that puts an additional burden on the \u2013 on the parenting relationship for the primary parent to \u2013 if that\u2019s not supported even in a separated relationship, it can make parenting additionally difficult. unsel] can you tell the court why? [witness] i think that a child \u2013 a young child that is neurotypical already finds a week about arrangement quite difficult, and you have to have a high level of cooperation and communication between parents to make that arrangement work for the child. when you add autism diagnosis on top of that, then that makes that lack of communication between parents very difficult for [x], and you\u2019re also looking at travel burden on a child, having two sets of rules, and also the fact that if you\u2019re not supporting the child\u2019s diagnosis, the child\u2019s treatment regime, getting them to appointments, things along those lines, the inconsistency is going to be very detrimental to a child\u2019s wellbeing. tness] children generally can cope with some differences in each household. a young child and an autistic \u2013 would find that a lot more challenging. so the more consistent that each household can be is the \u2013 the \u2013 less cognitive demands on the child, and, therefore, less anxiety about change. so it \u2013 it would be better for the child if the routines were very similar. [counsel] and the routine and consistency of a child across two households, would you agree, would be better served if there was \u2013 if there were able to be a good co-parenting relationship between both parents? [witness] yes, because you would need to be sharing a lot of information about a child, what they\u2019ve done at school, what therapies are working, what needs modifying, what a sleep routine is like, if \u2013 if they\u2019re upset, if they\u2019re unwell. there \u2013 there\u2019s a lot of information that needs to be shared. tness] because you\u2019re \u2013 you know, the child would be getting information from school, it \u2013 it would be things like homework or parties. so, like, the social \u2013 social calendar, sort of, events for school. they would need to be communicated if they\u2019re in the other parent\u2019s week. the child might leave something at the other parent\u2019s house, and that \u2013 that needs to be collected. a shoe or a uniform, for example, might be left at the other parent\u2019s house, and \u2013 and be needed. if the child\u2019s having regular therapy, homework tasks from that might need to be communicated as they change. feeding routines, sleeping routines would need to be communicated as they change. there \u2013 there\u2019s generally a lot of cooperation between households where an equal-time arrangement occurs especially with a young child that can\u2019t manage those tasks by themselves and needs support. [the court] and, [ms j], with an equal-time arrangement, if you assume that these parties haven\u2019t talked over the phone with each other or had a face-to-face conversation since separation in about easter 2018, does that tell for or against an equal-time arrangement? [witness] it would be against because you would hope that there would because (sic be) communication occurring already. if it \u2013 if it\u2019s four, nearly five years on with no communication, or very limited communication, it doesn\u2019t bode well for that occurring in the future. [the court] well, i should have said assume that there has been some level of text message communication since separation to date but assume that the father usually communicates with the maternal grandmother in relation to issues pertaining to the child. does that change your view? [witness] no. tness] those types of things can be useful. i still \u2013 even with an application, i still believe that there \u2013 there has to be a level of respect and cooperation between parents for co-parenting, and shared parental responsibility to be non-detrimental for the child. unsel] and in terms of that, if those difficulties could be overcome by a better attitude towards each other through the attendance of courses, i think that you recommended, and also in the interim period, continuing to \u2013 well, not continuing, but to use an application such as the ones that you\u2019ve described before, that would alleviate your concerns, wouldn\u2019t it, about the last remaining reason relating to parental \u2013 yes \u2013 sole parental responsibility, is that right? [witness] yes. if they were able \u2013 if they were able to successfully complete the course and implement a different relationship with each other, then, yes, that would alleviate that concern. unsel] do you \u2013 are you concerned that there would be an ongoing verbal problems between the two parents? [witness] there could \u2013 there \u2013 there is possibility of that. i mean, you know, it \u2013 it \u2013 it has occurred in the past, and \u2013 and it \u2013 it hasn\u2019t occurred more recently, as you\u2019ve said, but they also aren\u2019t speaking. so i \u2013 i do have concerns that the verbal abuse was quite of a high nature in terms of the language used, and even if [x] is not witness to it, he is impacted by the impact on the parent having that behaviour occur against them. tness] i think if that was the current position and they were able to change the relationship that they have, or \u2013 or even maintain what they currently have, and that\u2019s not occurring, then that would alleviate concerns of it occurring in the future. but it doesn\u2019t change a concern, or the impact of that verbal abuse would have had on a person when it occurs to them, because it can be intimidating, it can be experienced as fearful, it can have a negative impact on \u2013 on the person that it\u2019s occurring to. so one element of those things, if it \u2013 if it\u2019s the only element, does not mean that it\u2019s not a negative impact on the person that it occurs to. unsel] in terms of that, i want you to assume that the child is capable of sleeping in his own bed when he spends nights at his father\u2019s house? [witness] yes. okay. [counsel] does that in any way change your view about whether or not the child is capable of sleeping in his own bed? [witness] it \u2013 it wouldn\u2019t be unusual for him to need different levels of comfort from different parents. children do behave differently with different people. [counsel] that\u2019s, i suppose, part of the ---? [witness] he---- [counsel] ---environmental factors that we talk about? [witness] ---well, he \u2013 he may feel more \u2013 more able to express all his emotions in one house versus another....i wouldn\u2019t be able to say the reasoning for it, but you \u2013 in \u2013 on a general basis, you do see children who will have more emotional outbursts with one parent because they know that parent will accept the emotional outburst and give them the comfort that they need in that scenario, for example, or a parent could trigger an emotional outburst more in a different environment. it\u2019s very hard to say. it would depend on the specific child, but they do behave differently in different houses, for different reasons. tness] it\u2019s more reducing the cognitive demands on a child to anything \u2013 any change requires new processing of information, new time spent feeling comfortable in that environment. so we\u2019re trying \u2013 you try to reduce the demands that can be controlled, so that child can use their abilities to deal with things that do change that you \u2013 you have no control over. tness] it\u2019s an \u2013 an overload of \u2013 of sensory input, so the ability to hold in emotions can \u2013 or manage your behaviour in a situation can be, like, suppressed. so, yes, they \u2013 they cry or kick, or get aggressive as \u2013 because they don\u2019t necessarily have the language or the ability to explain why they\u2019re experiencing a difficulty in a change of the situation. tness] yes. parenting does not cause autism. autism is a \u2013 a \u2013 we call it a neurodivergency because the brain of an autistic child works differently to a neurotypical brain. the \u2013 the two parts of the brain, to put it relatively simply, your frontal lobe and your memory centres of your brain don\u2019t communicate, so you \u2013 you have \u2013 don\u2019t communicate well, i should say. so they \u2013 it is not something that is caused by parenting. it is not something that\u2019s caused by food that the children eat, or \u2013 or things like that. it is something that is developmentally \u2013 a child is born with it. it doesn\u2019t present until \u2013 generally, until children start to speak, or \u2013 or they miss milestones. so, generally, you know, you can \u2013 a diagnosis or a suspected diagnosis could occur around 18 months, but, generally, it\u2019s three to five that you will get a \u2013 a formal diagnosis for a child. [counsel] and i\u2019m right to say, am i not, that early intervention is important in relation to that diagnosis? [witness] very much so. yes. [counsel] and why is that? [witness] because of the astounding amount of change that the brain goes through in the early years of a person\u2019s life. like, your \u2013 your neural pathways are much more malleable the earlier that you are in your lifespan. it is much harder to change the older you get. unsel] so is this the situation, that if his honour is satisfied that there are still problems of communication between the mother and the father, if there is no established method for decision making, if there is a hostility between the parents, that you would persist with a recommendation that there be sole parental responsibility? [witness] yes. ... [counsel] i want to suggest to you that it is in [x]\u2019s best interests, as it is in the best interests of any child, to know that both of his parents have been involved in decision making? [witness] yes. [counsel] and that, in this case, that might be \u2013 that benefit to [x] might be best achieved by an arrangement where the father was given information in relation to future decisions, and an opportunity to make contributions to that decision? [witness] yes. [counsel] but that given the co-parenting relationship \u2013 or the lack of co-parenting relationship between the father and the mother, and the hostility that has existed between the families in relation to this matter, that the interests of [x] are not best served by an order for shared parental responsibility, do you agree with that? [witness] yes. yes. i do. unsel] i think you\u2019re aware that there has not been any face-to-face communication between the parents since separation, and there has been no oral communication, that is they appear not to have communicated over the telephone, you understand that? [witness] yes. [counsel] and to the \u2013 i want to suggest to you, at least to the extent to which communication depends upon trust, that trust is undermined, and continues to be undermined, by the father in, for example, his reference to the mother in 2020 as \u201cretarded\u201d, his reference to his \u2013 to the reasons why he was not prepared to pay arrears of child support, and in his comments in the recent report of [dr k] that the mother was the cause of delay in [x], do you accept that all of those things are likely to undermine trust? [witness] yes. [counsel] if \u2013 it would be very optimistic, would it not, to imagine that attendances on court \u2013 attendances on courses by these parents would have the impact of creating a cooperative relationship given the lack of evidence of that at any time in the past? [witness] yes. i think i \u2013 sorry. yes. i think that there has been no \u2013 if there has been no communication between them to date, and they haven\u2019t been able to get to an \u2013 a level of some cooperation, then there is reservations that one intervention would make a difference \u2013 a significant difference. unsel] the mother\u2019s response in relation to her own child, in relation to discipline, was to say that [x] does not need discipline. he needs positive reinforcement for good behaviours. do you have any comment to make about that? [witness] it \u2013 it is important to provide encouragement and redirection rather than a physical punishment for children. so, yes, that reinforcement for positive behaviour is a useful strategy to have. unsel] and in terms of consistent routine, the \u2013 my understanding is that if \u2013 leaving to one side the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, your view is that the co-parenting relationship between [mr bertram] and [ms kade], in this case, is not one that provides you a basis for support for an equal-shared parental responsibility order? [witness] that\u2019s correct. yes. [counsel] and is that also true of any order that would lead to more time for the father than what i will call the extended weekend time that is proposed halfway through next year, that is the arrangement of friday to monday? [witness] yes. [counsel] and do i take it that, in relation to [x], that is made more compelling because of the diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder? [witness] that\u2019s correct. [counsel] and why is that? [witness] because of the abilities of \u2013 the impact of the \u2013 if the relationship is what it has been described in that there\u2019s no cooperation, there\u2019s no communication, then you\u2019re asking a child with a level of challenges, and [x]\u2019s diagnosis of autism is the \u2013 the moderate range if we talk on the spectrum. so he has got a \u2013 a range of challenges that have already been assessed that they are going to be made more difficult by parents that do not trust or communicate and can navigate changes that will occur throughout going to school, interacting with peers, changes to therapies, changes to homework, things along those lines. [counsel] and am i right to think that given that the \u2013 he has been in the care of his mother all his life, that he describes his safe place as being in his mother\u2019s household, that the need \u2013 that his own personal security is tied up with his life with his mother in that household? [witness] from \u2013 from what i have heard, it would \u2013 it has been described as \u2013 as his mother\u2019s bed. so if that\u2019s what [x] is saying, then that makes sense. yes. relevant legal principles the best interests of the child section 60cc considerations subsection (2a) \u2013 the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents: a primary consideration ] what these definitions convey is that \u201cmeaningful\u201d, when used in the context of \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d, is synonymous with \u201csignificant\u201d which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cof consequence\u201d. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive one. quantitive concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant. in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92 at [121] the full court accepted as appropriate this interpretation by brown j of \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d. subsection (2b) \u2013 the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to,

person to have access to a child, a person shall not, without just cause or excuse, hinder or prevent the first-mentioned person from obtaining access to the child in accordance with the order or interfere with the access to the child that the first-mentioned person is entitled to in accordance with the order.\u201d a party\u2019s subjective view of the rights and wrongs of a decision cannot be relied on as \u201cjust cause or excuse\u201d or \u201creasonable cause\u201d. evidence of changed circumstances or of matters not considered when the order was made might be.[17] on the one hand, it is quite clear that they must not do anything to prevent access taking place. as put by [ms f], they must do nothing physically or emotionally to spoil the access, they must have the child prepared physically for the access. on the other hand, it seems clear that they are not obliged force the child go on access when the child does not wish to do so. the question that does not appear to be dealt with in any authority to which i have been referred is the test to be applied when the child expresses a wish not to go with the person seeking to exercise access. is there some obligation on the custodial parents to take some positive action in relation to this attitude of the child? in the absence of authority, my view is that what persons in the position of the defendants are obliged to do is to do whatever is reasonable to bring about compliance with the court order. if in a particular case in all the circumstances would be reasonable to take positive steps to bring about some change in the attitude wishes of the child, then i think persons in the position of the defendants are obliged by the order to take those steps.[19] ould have to have parked her car, turned off the engine and told each daughter to alight. if refusal then ensued she then needs to herself alight the car, open the door for the children, if necessary unbuckle a seat belt and verbally sternly require the girls to get out of the car. any refusal should then result in a request to the father to encourage the children and standing away whilst this happened. stopping but not parking the car and not turning off the engine and then quickly driving off is not a reasonable attempt. even if the driving off follows a verbal request from the child. then there is the following passage which, although lengthy, is worthy of being repeated and it is as follows: i have already made reference to the implied obligation of the custodian to take reasonable steps to ensure that the access stipulated in an order takes place. words and actions have meaning in context and affect. it is not a sufficient discharge of custodian\u2019s obligations, express or implied, to point to words and actions and to say, in effect: \u201cyou see i tried. but the child does not want to go,\u201d and thereafter to figuratively fold their arms as if it were an end of the matter. theirs is an active role with an obligation to positively encourage access. it is not a discharge of their duty to set up access to fail. that is to say, it is not sufficient to make a token effort at compliance by the utterance of a few phrases which, in the main, are designed to impart to the child not positive encouragement to go on access, but to convey the burden on both the child and the custodian of compliance with the obligation. conclusion about contraventions compliance sanctions that a bond is a solemn promise and agreement by the person entering into the bond to the court to comply with the obligations set out

no co-parenting relationship between the parties. [mr rong] and [ms huan] do not communicate to any regular degree. they do not conjointly attend events together for the children ([x]). they do not engage in any form of considered, immersive conversation in relation to decisions affecting the children. in the main, any correspondence pertaining to [y] and [x] occurs by the parties reflecting legal representatives. ... the circumstances in which [y] came to live in [country n] with the paternal grandparents, and remain there since [late] 2016, is the source of some dispute between the parties. [mr rong] maintains that [y] went to live with the paternal grandparents because the responded mother was struggling after the birth of their second child, and initially agreed to the child relocating. he has deposed out, \u201cmy parents travelled to australia to celebrate [y]'s third birthday. when they saw [y], they told me \u2018he looks unhealthy and has put on weight. he spends too much time on [tv]. your house is also messy. you need to clean it\u2019. i worked long hours and found little time to clean the home. [ms huan] provided little assistance. my parents then began to clean up the home and maintain the garden. my mother then asked [ms huan] and i, \u2018can [y] stay with us in [country n]? i am worried he is not being properly looked after. he can study at a good school, too\u2019. [ms huan] said, \u2018no, this is my son, why does he have to go back to [country n]? why can't he study here?\u2019 my mother replied, \u2018you do not look after [y] well, and you are only concerned about money\u2019. [ms huan] and i agreed for [y] to live with my parents in [country n] to help with his early education\u201d ([mr rong] affidavit, 12/05/21). alternately, [ms huan] has deposed, \u201c[y] is currently in [country n] with [mr rong]'s parents. i say that this was arranged by [mr rong] and his parents without my knowledge and i did not agree with it. this has been a major point of contention in my relationship with [mr rong] ...in 2016, i discovered i was pregnant with our second son. this was unplanned. it made me nervous as there would be no one to look after [y] while i was in the late stages of pregnancy . i was worried i would not be able to pass the probation at the [jj company] if i were trying to look after [y] while dealing with late stage pregnancy...[in] 2016, my mother in law ([mr rong]'s mother, [ms o]) suggested to me to send [y] back to [country n] for his education. [mr rong] thought this was a great idea. i was horrified at the idea that [y] would leave the family and live in [country n]. i said i would never agree to such an idea and was not interested...a few weeks later, [ms o], [mr rong] and i discussed my pregnancy and my concerns about the probation. [ms o] suggested... \u2018 [y] could come to [country n] for a short period, until you have given birth to your new child ([x]) and return to work. then i could send him back to you \u2019...i realised her offer meant that i would be able to concentrate on work full time get through probation and not have to worry about making the money for the day-to-day fees for [y] for that period and ensure the baby and [y] were both safe . i agreed to [ms o] and [mr rong]\u2019s proposal that [y] go short-term to [country n] to stay with his grandparents until i return to work after having my second child\u201d ([ms huan] affidavit, 10/06/21). [y] has remained substantively in [country n] since that time. father argues that [y] is thriving living with the paternal grandparents, he also attends boarding school during the week days. [ms huan] has argued that she has made innumerable attempts to negotiate [y]'s return to australia to live with his parents and his younger brother, rather than be separated from them and attend school in another country. she has described that in 2017, she again raised the issue of [y] returning to australia, and that it was, \u201cthen that he revealed the plan all along was to keep [y] in [country n] till he was 18\u201d([ms huan] affidavit, 10/06/21). she has further deposed that, \u201c i was traumatised. i felt powerless to stop it. [mr rong] and his family seemed to have all the power and [mr rong] was more than happy to do what they wanted. the only way i could solve this was to work out a way to convince them to bring [y] back to australia. i felt powerless. i must have argued 100 times with [mr rong] about returning [y] to australia since he left for [country n]. nevertheless, i was so confused as i was scared if i persisted [mr rong] would divorce me, throw me out of the house again like he did in 2015 or even take [x] away from me and send him to [country n]\u201d ([ms huan] affidavit, 10/06/21). aside from the allegations of aggressive behaviour, and the dispute regarding [y] living in [country n], both parents have expressed other concerns. [mr rong] has referred to the respondent mother's ability to care for the children, claiming that at one point, the house became unkempt, [y] was unattended too by his mother, and that there were issues with the children's diet. he has further argued that, since separation, [ms huan] has made unilateral decisions relating to [x], and prevented him from playing a significant role in the younger child's life. [ms huan] herself has characterised the applicant father as disinterested and uninvolved in the children's care throughout the course of their young lives. she has described him as only available when the children were sick, and lacking in basic care competencies. moreover, she has characterised the entire paternal family as coercive, financially bullying, and overbearing. ... 14. the areas that the current assessment will address include: the final living arrangements for the two children of the marriage, [y] (7) and [x] (5), including the amount and configuration of their time in each household, the relationship between the children and each of their parents, including factors such as care history and prior involvement, the co-parenting relationship and capacity of the parties to effectively collaborate in relation to their children, the question of [y] returning to australia, the views expressed by the children and the weight these may reasonably attract, any risk arising from mutual allegations of aggressive behaviour made by each party, concerns expressed by the father regarding [ms huan] struggling to cope with the children after [x] was born, as well as claims she unreasonably prevented him from playing a role in the life of [x] after separation, concerns expressed by the mother about [mr rong] showing a lack of investment and involvement with the children throughout their lives, concerns about his basic parenting competencies with the boys, and allegations that she has been coerced and manipulated by the father and his family, including in relation to [y] moving to [country n] and remaining there since late-2016, interview data [mr rong] there was nothing clinically remarkable about [mr rong]\u2019s presentation throughout the assessment. his mood, affect, and form-of-thought were within normal limits. he spoke with a straightforward and fairly simple (albeit competent) language code. although his narrative was largely internally consistent, there were instances where he appeared to deny or minimise different allegations put to him. he also impressed with a cursory knowledge of the children, including their interests, strengths, personality characteristics, routine, and activities. ... throughout the assessment, [mr rong] was quick to criticise the responded mother. even when asked questions about his own role with the children, he often pivoted to a description of how [ms huan] struggled to care for the boys. at one point he described, \u201c she didn't look after [y] very well. all i can see is that [y] is very skinny, didn't eat well, always (talking) in [language n]\u201d, and, \u201cshe doesn't know how to look after the baby. she doesn't know how to cook. she never thought about someone else\u201d. [mr rong] also complained best he responded mother had been unreasonably restrictive with his time with the children , especially following their separation. he remarked, \u201c she stopped me from having a relationship with [x]... after she's done the knife thing, when i would come home i noticed the light would be on when i came home, everyone was in bed, she would not allow [x] to spend time with me... she tried to stop me to have a relationship with [x]. i woke up and [x] came into the room to get me. he wanted to play the block (building) games... [x\u2019s] mum was saying [x] come to me... she came to the room where we played the block game. she came to the room and took him away. [x] was saying no i want dad... what can i do? how can she do this to a child\u201d. [mr rong] remained of the view that [y] should continue to live in [country n] . he characterised his son as settled and well adjusted , and was receiving a superior level of education. he acknowledged that the idea had originally come from his own mother, and that \u201cwe had a long discussion about this \u201d. he continued, \u201c at that moment, [y] was not very healthy ... in [country n] there is a lot of variety of food ... school is a long term decision...if she ([ms huan] ) disagrees, the whole thing won't happen. nobody give her pressure. and from the other side, it's good for the child. and their background is [language n] background... not learn (there) forever, just finished year 6\u201d. he summarised, \u201cof course he ([y]) wants to keep studying, keep playing [his musical instrument]. he loves his life now. he's lived in [country n] since after he turned 2 (years). he's lived there the last 5 years. he has friends in [country n]\u201d. in terms of [x], [mr rong] expressed the desire to spend more time with his youngest son, explaining, \u201ci want more time with him, of course. he says we never have enough time, 3 hours is not enough... if i was going to see him every day, that's possible... probably another few hours, building up, then one day overnight, then two days overnight\u201d. [ms huan] [ms huan] impressed as pleasant, polite, and well dressed. although she was initially nervous at the beginning of the consultation, she became more settled as the conversation progressed. at times she was tearful, especially when discussing the impact of the conflict in the marriage on the children, and her distress at [y] living in [country n]. there was nothing otherwise anomalous about her mood, mental state, or reasoning process. indeed, she presented as sincere, the narrative was cogent, internally consistent, and persuasive, and she presented as genuine in her concerns about the children in the care of their father. ... when asked about the decision for [y] to move to [country n], [ms huan] explained that the proposal had only ever been put to her as a temporary solution to help in the months following [x] being born. she said that she had constantly implored [mr rong] and his family to have [x] come home. she said the decision had come after [mr rong] and his mother coercing her, \u201cthey keep saying i'm an unfit mother. i'm not a perfect mother that will raise my children as good as [mr rong]\u2019s mum. i don't know why they have this judgement...because i'm from my rural area maybe, i'm not from a big city. i asked [mr rong]\u2019s mother , why can't you let me raise my own children. she told me she raised her own kids, [mr rong] and [mr bb], and they're not good enough, and people laugh. so she needs to use [y], to prove to other people, especially her siblings, she can raise children\u201d. she said also that whenever she had raised her desire for [y] to return to australia, \u201cthey've used the cut off method . whenever the court decision wasn't good for them, they cut off my connection\u201d \u2013effectively that child would become unavailable to talk to her on the phone. ... [ms o] [ms o] was consulted with the assistance of an interpreter, via video-link. she impressed with an assertive demeanour. she appeared somewhat inconvenienced by the process. she often dominated the conversation, at times, launching into tangential tirades or mission statements, resulting in the interpreter struggling to keep pace. there was a palpable lack of understanding of the complexity of the situation, including the need for [y] to have a relationship with both of his parents. [ms o] maintained that the respondent mother had always agreed to [y] moving to [country n]. she explained, \u201cin 2016, when [y]'s parents brought him over at that time, [y]'s mum was pregnant...they said to me, [y] will be staying with us all the way until he finishes primary school... he will need a long-term visa ... the parents had to prepare materials to lodge a long-term visa application for [y] ...the visa application would require both of their signatures\u201d. under repeated questioning, [ms o] admitted that the respondent mother had made an overture towards her for [y] to return to australia, describing simply that, \u201cyes she did, but each time she brought it up, this issue, it was always when she was in a state of upset or throwing a tantrum. but once she calmed down, she did not bring up the issue again...actually, she only mentioned the change of their mind once\u201d. she denied that she had ever attempted to influence [y] in his relationship with his mother, or restrict telephone access. she commented, \u201cwe have never discussed with the children, anything about the case... all she has been saying is lies... it's impossible for me to control the child, what sort of power do i have?\u201d. [ms o] described that [y] was flourishing attending boarding school in [city ll]. she spoke of his academic achievements as well as his [music] skills, describing that he had won many awards and competitions in music. she felt it was in the best interests of the child to remain living in [country n] for the duration of his primary school, and that he could return to australia thereafter. she explained, \u201cwe respect the original plan, which was after graduation after primary school, he would come back to australia for his schooling\u201d. when questioned about whether [y] would actually want to return at that point, she stated, \u201cthat's impossible. since [y] was able to understand things, we have always been telling him that after his primary education he will be going back to australia ... in terms of why we want him to study all the way through primary school, it's because [language n] is a difficult language to learn\u201d. [ms mm] & [mr nn] the maternal grandparents were also consulted remotely from their home in [city j]. it was [mr nn] who made the majority of submissions. the grandparents described their daughter as a competent mother to [x]. they described their grandson as thriving in the care of his mother, despite suboptimal (temporary) living arrangements. they spoke of [ms huan\u2019s] distress at being separated from [y]. it was their understanding that the decision for [y] to live in [country n] was a temporary one, explaining, \u201cfrom what we have heard from [ms huan] is that [y] would be there for a few months\u201d. they further expressed concern about the apparent dominance of the paternal grandmother, characterising [ms o] as intrusive and coercive. they were worried too about the possibility of [y] being deliberately disaffected from his mother by the paternal family, describing, \u201cof course, over time adults would say things and teach him things\u201d. [y] (7) [y]\u2019 engagement during assessment was modest. unsurprisingly, given his age, he was somewhat distractible. it was also apparent that [y] was not alone when consulted (despite that request being made), repeatedly looking off to a fixed point out of camera when more pertinent issues were raised. [y]\u2019s responses also appeared rehearsed. notwithstanding these issues, i was able to, complete some basic discussion about his family and current circumstances. [y] said that he was happy and settled living in [country n] and attending boarding school. he explained, \u201cwell, i have many friends at my school. our school also has good teachers. i'm very happy there. it's a school with a very good academic (sic) as well as cultural qualities. grandpa cooks good food. grandma helps me do my homework and she also takes me out playing and watches me when i play [music]\u201d. [y] further stated that he understood he would return to australia upon completion of primary school, stating, \u201ci'll go to secondary school in australia\u201d. he said that he had a deep connection with his grandmother, who he characterised as the most important person in his life. [y] said that he was currently not speaking to his mother . he remarked, \u201c i don't like her... she doesn't love me, so i don't love her\u201d. when asked to elaborate, [y] explained, \u201cbecause when i didn't know her date of birth and i don't know her name, she yelled at me... it was like this, dad's birthday was approaching and then i was talking to mom and i said to mum, dad's birthday is approaching, we should celebrate his birthday, and she said what about my birthday , do you know when my birthday is? and i didn't know, and she yelled at me... also in terms of going to school, she took the initiative to approach my school to cancel the enrolment ... sometimes when she was having video calls with me she would ask me what i eat, then she stopped calling, she asked me why i was not talking to her and i said because you're not talking to me\u201d. [y] said he could not recall any positive memories with his mother. he described a very different relationship with his father, whom he said he missed. he described, \u201che would show me some clips, he bought a lot of toys for me, bought me a watch and buy me some toys from those movies, he also listens to me when i play [music], he also corrects my english pronunciation... that is really nice to me\u201d. [x] (5) [x] was consulted only briefly because of his age. [x] said that he enjoyed spending time with his father each sunday, explaining, \u201ci eat, and then play [games], and then get out for a drive, watch some tv, and then i have to go back home\u201d. he said that he would like to spend more time with [mr rong]. [x] confirmed that he understood his parents were not on good terms, acknowledging that he had rarely seen them interact. regarding his brother, [x] impressed with very little knowledge of [y], his personality, his mannerisms, and his behaviour. he said only that they speak occasionally via video-conference, although characterised this as cursory and perfunctory. observations in light of [y] remaining in [country n], observations were conducted only with [x] and each of his parents. with his father, [x] appeared comfortable. there were no obvious signs of distress. [x] invited [mr rong] to play a board game which the father reciprocated. while playing together, [x] made few spontaneous remarks. he appeared focussed on the game. there was no banter, laughter of levity. [mr rong] also seldom spoke. he made occasional encouraging remarks and took educational opportunities as they presented. indeed, [mr rong] impressed as highly focussed on [x]\u2019s learning and achievement, potentially at the expense of more light-hearted interactions. with his mother, there was a less novel dimension to the interaction. although she was nervous, [ms huan] was warm, attentive and affectionate. [x] impressed as far more accustomed to being in her company. the pair settled on another board game, which they played happily together. [x] needed to explain the rules to his mother, which allowed invited jokes and levity. [x] appeared more engaged and relaxed with his mother, as though their interaction and play was a more normal and routine part of his care and daily life. evaluation the parents, [mr rong] (39) and [ms huan] (36), were in a relationship for around 7 years, separating under the one roof in march 2020. [ms huan] vacated the family home around 15 months later. there are two children of the marriage, [y] (7) and [x] (5). at the age of 2 years, under circumstances that are disputed, [y] left australia to live with his grandparents in [country n], remaining there ever since. the parents have not seen their son, in person, since late-2019, prior to the global pandemic. [x] has always lived principally with his mother since the parties physically separated, now seeing his father for 3 hours each week. the central dispute before the court revolves around [y]\u2019s substantive place of residence, noting his mother\u2019s desire for him to return to australia, as well as the longer term time and living arrangements for both children, particularly [x], for whom there is no proposal for him to live overseas. co-parenting relationship the coparenting situation in this matter is entirely sub optimal. although there is now no intervention orders that would otherwise prevent the parties from engaging more meaningfully around their children, their communication is sporadic, superficial, and at times combative. these are not two people who have amicably decided to embark in different directions, but rather parents who were embroiled in significant conflict prior to separation, disagreeing on myriad of issues related to the children, and clearly exhibiting differing parenting styles. there remains much of the ill will, hostility, and distrust. both parents have been reticent to communicate, although it is [ms huan] who is most resistant to interacting with the applicant father. what has followed is a situation in which the parents have not engaged in meaningful conversations about significant decisions affecting the children, they do not model appropriate exchanges in the presence of [x], and they have not held/attended joint events together creating a sense of unity for [x]. in all, the transition from marriage to separated co-parents has not been smooth. there are likely a multitude of factors that have contributed to the tension between these parents. at base, their marriage was undoubtedly conflictual. they obviously developed a level of mutual contempt. since parting ways, their views of one another have become even more entrenched. [mr rong] characterises the respondent mother as controlling and an inclusive. he has portrayed her as aggressive, reactive, and volatile during the marriage. he claims she is focused solely on money, effectively ordering him to work long hours in order to provide for the family. once they separated, he argues she became more overbearing, and refused to allow him a relationship with [x]. he prioritises the children's education, criticising the respondent mother in several aspects of our parenting, including her focus on their academic attainment. alternately, [ms huan] feels impugned and put down by [mr rong]. she characterises him as critical and overbearing. she perceives a power imbalance where she has been dismissed on account of her education and place of birth. she feels coerced and manipulated by the entire paternal family. she feels powerless. she interprets messages she has received from the applicant father as snide and irascible, in furtherance of the same dynamic that existed within the marriage. unfortunately, both of the children are aware of the difficulties between their mother and father. they, especially [x], have witnessed these first-hand the conflict prior to their mother vacating the family home. [x] was exposed to regular arguments, as well as periods where his parents would not talk. during the current assessment, both children made clear their understanding that their mother and father are not on good terms. [y], in particular, assumed a particularly tribal posture, clearly aligned with the paternal family, and increasingly rejecting of his mother and extended maternal relatives. it is safe to say that the discordant marriage, and ongoing lack of unity and collaboration, has impacted on these boys. it will continue to do so. at a basic level, it is clear that [y], and to a lesser extent [x], do not feel they have the emotional permission to have an unencumbered relationship with the other side of their family. i am particularly concerned by [y]\u2019s presentation in this respect, as will be discussed below. although there is no strong clinical argument at this point for one parent to assume sole parental responsibility for the children, there is certainly a need to increase communication between the parties, and continuity for the children as they transition between their two homes (should [y] return to live in australia). at minimum, i would recommend that these parents exchange a routine weekly handover summarising events relating to the children. this should include information regarding the children's education, medical/psychological issues, behaviour, and extracurricular activities. initially this should occur in written form, although eventually, it should be an aspiration for these parents to discuss these types of areas directly. it should also become practice for [ms o] to correspond with the parties while [y] remains resident in [country n]. it is also important that the children are made aware that their mother and father will be providing a handover to each other summarising their time in each household, to increase the sense of unity. i would also encourage the parties attending upon an independent clinician to develop a joint set of rules, routine, and expectations for the children that can be implemented in both households. this is designed to ensure that the level of disruption associated with the children's transition between their mother and father is minimised. finally, the court may wish to consider restraining by injunction the parties from discussing matters in the presence of [y] and [x] that may be of a more adult nature (e.g., school enrolments, travel, financial issues), or potentially denigrating and belittling. parent-child relationships having now consulted with the parents and children, and conducted an observation with [x] and each of the parties, it is evident that these children have very different relationships with their mother and father. [x] clearly has a loving bond with [ms huan]. she has been the predominant care figure for this child throughout the entire day of his life. she is the person with whom [x] is most comfortable and secure. there are no immediate concerns in relation to the bond, connection, and attachment between [x] and his mother. with his father, there is a more cursory dimension to the relationship. [x] is far less acquainted with his father. he is less familiar with [mr rong]'s routine, parenting style, and care practises. this is unsurprising given the differing roles that each party has played in his upbringing to date. while there is no evidence of fear or unease in [x] when in the company of his father, it would be erroneous to conclude that the bond he has with his father at all approximates that he has with his mother. this will be an important consideration when determining [x]\u2019s living arrangements, as [x] will not cope well with immediately spending protracted periods away from his mother, and in the company of his father, with whom he is undoubtedly less acquainted. there are far more concerns regarding the relationship between [y] and his parents. [y] was openly hostile in relation to his mother. he was bordering on rejecting of her. he claimed to be unable to recall any positive interactions with her throughout the course of his life. he was concrete and obstinate, assuming a highly adversarial posture. when asked about his father, [x] was aggrandizing. he venerated [mr rong], highlighting only positive attributes. notwithstanding [y]\u2019s commentary about the relationship he has with each parent, analysis of his submissions demonstrate that he is largely unfamiliar with either parent. he had spent little time with them throughout the course of his life. he will have no working memory of life growing up with either [mr rong] or [ms huan]. this is not a little boy who has a loving, immersive relationship with his biological mother and father. his care history would evidence that his principle attachment figure he sees is the paternal grandmother. i am particularly concerned that there may be an emergent alienation dynamic occurring in the case of the older of the two boys. the fact that [y] was so dichotomous in his appraisal of his parents is alarming. the fact that he would find fault with everything that his mother has done is clinically remarkable. that i [y] has been informed, presumably by his father or paternal grandmother, of certain actions taken by his mother, or her desire for him to return to australia, is damaging and manipulative. there is ample clinical evidence, based on the presentation of this child, that he has been influenced by the paternal grandmother, passively, and very likely, in a more deliberate way. [ms o]\u2019s criticism and disdain for the respondent mother was ill-concealed during the current assessment, and i suspect will have been absorbed by [y], having lived with [ms o] for the majority of his life. i would also interpret the fact that [y] has been informed of certain issues of a more adult nature, as a knowing, pernicious attempt to demonise [ms huan] in the mind of the child. the question must be raised regarding whether, should [y] remain living in the care of his paternal grandmother, this process will continue unencumbered, resulting in [y] eventually rejecting his mother entirely, for the longer term. given the clinical data available at the time of assessment, there is a significant risk that this boy will become alienated from his mother should he remain in the care of his paternal grandmother over the next 4-5 years of his primary education. children\u2019s views pursuant to s60cc(3)(a), the expressed wishes of the children were fairly straightforward. [y] was adamant that he wished to remain living in [country n] with his grandparents, and attending boarding school there, while [x] stated he wished to continue living mainly with his mother, albeit with increased time spent with his father. other relevant data points to emerge from consultation with the children were that (i) both boys were aware of the ongoing tension and disunity between their parents, (ii) the children made little reference to their connection with one another, and (iii) [y] described feeling happy and settled at his current school, and (iv) [y]\u2019s submissions impressed as rehearsed, concrete, and potentially provided with the ambient influence of someone in the room during the consultation. notwithstanding the views that these children have expressed during the current consultation, it is my opinion that the weight that the court should place on their wishes should be limited, given their ages. children under the age of 13-14 years, tend to reason through complex decisions, such as their living arrangements and relationship with each parent, in a predictably underdeveloped way. they tend to focus on short-term outcomes rather than long-term gains. they can be suggestible and easily incentivised. they can prioritise notions of parity, equality, and fairness. they can fail to consider the practical challenges that may ensue from a given living arrangement. they can be emotionally driven in their decision making. in the case of [y] and [x], some, if not many, of these features were apparent. i would note also [y]\u2019s presentation when consulted \u2013 he has clearly been privy to information that is inappropriate, such as his mother seeking to unenroll him from his school. the fact that there was a third party in his vicinity when he was assessed, will assuredly have impacted on his submissions. the tribal, concrete, and inflexible posture [y] demonstrated would also suggest some level of influence by those around him, notably the paternal grandmother. in all, for a variety of reasons, quite aside from their age/stage of development, the expressed wishes of these boys should not be determinative as the court adjudicates their parenting arrangements. risk pursuant to s60cc(2)(b), the central risk issue in this matter revolves around mutual allegations of aggressive behaviour alleged by both parents. [mr rong] has alleged that [ms huan] was verbally abusive, physically overbearing, and at one point, she threw a kitchen knife at him. [ms huan] claims that she was called names, put down, impugned, and slapped by the applicant father. it is ultimately a matter for the court to test the evidence and determined which narrative may most closely align with events during the marriage. the allegations as they exist currently are a matter of disputed fact. what is clear, however, is that the marriage between [mr rong] and [ms huan] was highly conflictual, replete with arguments, agitated exchanges, and periods in which the parents would avoid each other and occupy different rooms within the house. it does appear at times that both parents escalated and became combative. police have been called. it is safe to conclude that their marriage was volatile, and impacted by the involvement of the extended paternal family, whom seem to have oft sided with [mr rong], agitating behind the scenes, and further decrying the respondent mother. even by [mr rong]'s own submissions, his mother directly confronted [ms huan] and berated her about her competencies and parenting, rather than availing support, comfort, and advice. without being able to definitively confirm either parent\u2019s specific claims about the other, i am of the view that there was mutual conflict during the marriage. further, i would suggest that any aggressive behaviour that did emerge in the years prior to their eventual breakup impresses as situational, rather than resultant of a coercive-controlling dynamic in which one parent entirely dominated the other. their conflict emanated from incidental and varying issues, rather than one parent\u2019s need to an attempt by one parent to rule, dictate, isolate and terrorise the other. i would note that the behaviour by the paternal grandmother has, in my view, been coercive, domineering and manipulative. however, the dynamic within the marriage between [mr rong] and [ms huan], which likely resulted in mutual aggression, appears to have related to situation (albeit recurring) issues. assuredly this has been damaging for the children and it certainly failed to model for them respectful conflict resolution strategies. still, it is my view that the risk of recurring confrontations is probably reduced now that the parties are separated. there is still some likelihood that disagreements and conflict will emerge from time to time - given also that these parents have differing priorities and approaches to parenting the children - however [mr rong] and [ms huan] now occupying different households does reduce the opportunity for them to descend into outward hostilities. this is a positive overall for [y] and [x]. i would not consider there to now be an unacceptable risk to the children, arising from the mutual claims of family violence, to the boys in the years ahead. the concern for these boys of the ongoing discord between their parents is of an emotional/psychological nature. parental concerns aside from any issues of risk, both parents have expressed concerns about aspects of the other parties\u2019 conduct as it relates to the children. [mr rong] has accused the mother of struggling to care for the children, keeping an unkempt household, and otherwise failing to allow him reasonable time with [x]. conversely, [ms huan] has characterised the applicant father as largely absent from the lives of the boys, disinterested and uninvolved, and speculated that he likely lacks the basic ability to competently care for the children. she has further posited that there has been a degree of coercion and manipulation of [y], including by severing her ability to contact him remotely while he is in [country n]. regarding the issues raised by [mr rong], i do believe that there is merit in the thesis that [ms huan] was anxious and concerned during the period leading up to the impending birth of their second child, [x]. she was on probation at her new job, she was largely without assistance from her husband on account of his work obligations, she was a relatively young mother, living in a country without her parents, there was financial stress, she was subject to overt criticism and conflict from the paternal family. assuredly, this would have rendered even the most competent of parents feeling overwhelmed. to restate, i have no doubt she was overwrought by the prospect of another child coming along in the period leading up to [x]\u2019s birth. to suggest, however, that [ms huan] is a fundamentally unattuned, incapable, and unfit parent, is, in my view, unreasonable. she has availed an adequate, if not sophisticated and efficient (given the pressures) level of care, for the children. there is no clinical information to infer that [x] is not thriving in her care. lamentably, she has not had the opportunity to do the same for [y]. turning to the question of [ms huan] unreasonably curtailing [mr rong]'s involvement with [x], the key term is unreasonably. she may well have rebuffed [mr rong]'s requests for increased time with [x]. she is certainly the predominant and ascendant care figure for this child. context, however, is important. [ms huan] is a woman who has been removed from the life of her first born son. she had minimal input from the children\u2019s father during their early life, by his own admissions, on account of his work schedule. she had been bullied, undermined, and coerced by the paternal family. against this backdrop, and with well-founded concerns regarding [mr rong]'s investment/knowledge/parenting acumen, she may well have been circumspect about relinquishing the care of [x] to his father. in terms of the issues raised by the respondent mother, i have formed the view that [mr rong] had a role with the boys that was far secondary to her during their early life. patently, [mr rong] has deferred to his mother in a number of respects. he also had work obligations, exceeding that of [ms huan], at least for some period. i would query also whether [mr rong] himself is beholden \u2013psychologically and financially \u2013 to his mother. [ms o]\u2019s footprint in the lives of these young parents has been profound, and in large measure, leads to the situation currently before the court. given the information available, i am strongly of the view that (i) [mr rong] has had, at time, very little input into the lives of the boys, (ii) he has colluded with his mother to influence decisions relating to [y], and to a lesser degree, [x], (iii) [mr rong] and his family have not support and assisted [ms huan], and (iv) [mr rong] demonstrates only a superficial connection with the children, for reasons or prior involvement (among other factors). time and living arrangements the question before the court pertains to the final living arrangements for the two children of the relationship, [y] (7) and [x] (5). namely, whether [y] should return to australia or remain in [country n] with his paternal grandparents, and secondarily, the time/living arrangements for the children between each parent. [y] has been in [country n] throughout the duration of his early childhood. the circumstances of this are disputed. irrespective, [ms huan] has, unquestionably, by [ms o] and [mr rong]'s admissions, sought for him to return to australia. that request, by a loving, invested, biological mother, has been denied. still, [y] wants to stay in [country n]. he identifies his paternal grandmother as his primary care figure. no doubt she is. however, this little boy is being denied a relationship with the two most important people in his life, namely his mother and father. he is also effectively excommunicated from his younger brother. his presentation is such that, if not amended, he will, in all likelihood, come to reject his mother entirely. this is not only a case where living arrangements are relevant, this is a matter of burgeoning alienation. [y], in my view, is in the process of being disaffected from his mother. were he to remain in [country n], there is a very real likelihood of him never returning to australia, or if he does, never having a meaningful relationship with his mother (and her family). while there will be unquestionable disruption for this boy to come back to [city j] \u2013 certainly against his wishes \u2013 [y] has the legal right to have a meaningful relationship with both parents, under s60cc(2)(a), something that he is currently denied. also, the fact that he has no proximate connection with his brother, is distressing. [y] and [x]\u2019s lack of connection, as is currently the case, will have life long implications. if the court deems it important for this child to have a relationship, a truly meaningful relationship with his mother and father (and brother), then he must return to australia. regarding [x], this boy needs to live mainly with his mother. his age, care history, and differing relationship with each parent, should dictate such. he should, however, spend more time with his father. the current, interim arrangements are not sufficient in the longer term. i would share [ms huan\u2019s] concerns regarding [mr rong]'s involvement and competencies, although [x] is now an older child \u2013 more reliant, communicative, and competent. he should progress to overnight time with his father, at a suitable pace, commensurate with his best interests and adjustment. it is not unreasonable to aim for this boy to eventually spend multiple nights each week with his father, somewhere along the lines of a 10/4 fortnightly arrangement. in absolute terms, my recommendation to this honourable court is that [y] return to australia, that there be a moratorium on his time and communication with the paternal family, that [x] progressively increase his time with his father (culminating in two nights each week), and that eventually, both boys live with each parent in a 10/4 fortnightly schedule, remaining mainly with their mother, while spending meaningful time with [mr rong]. i would, however, counsel the applicant father to ensure he better manages the pernicious influence of his extended family, so that [y] and [x] can enjoy a relationship with both sides of their family unburdened. outcomes in line with these opinions, there are several outcomes/recommendations submitted: that, the parties should exchange a routine weekly handover summarising the children's time in the care of each parent, including information relating to their health, education, behaviour, and extracurricular activities, that, both parents should complete a parenting after separation program, that, the parents should attend upon an independent clinician to develop a conjoint set of rules, boundaries, routine, and expectations that can be implemented in both households, that, there is no strong clinical argument for one parent to assume sole parental responsibility for [y] and [x], that, the court may consider an order restraining by injunction the parents from denigrating or belittling the other in the presence of the children, in addition to discussing matters of a more adult nature, such as property disbursement and financial settlement, that, the conflict between the parties during their marriage most likely falls in the situational category of family violence, with a reduced risk now that [mr rong] and [ms huan] are separated, that, further review of the father\u2019s mental health is clinically indicated, that, [y] should return to australia to live primarily with his mother, that, [y] may need professional support to acclimatise if he is compelled to leave [country n], that, the children should live with each parent, commensurate with the recommendation of paragraph 55 and 56, single expert\u2019s oral evidence written submissions on behalf of the father background the father is 40 years old. the wife is 37 years old. they commenced cohabitation in 2014 in [city j]. they were married [in] 2014 and separated in about march 2020 but continued living under one roof until may 2021. the cohabitation was therefore about 7 years. two children were born of the marriage: [y] who is 8 years old, and [x] who is 6 years old. both parenting and property issues are in dispute. parenting: the law part vii of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d) is where the legislative provisions concerning parenting cases can be found. the purpose of the legislation is to provide a pathway for the court when making parenting orders. the central focus underpinning the legislation is to make parenting orders which are at all times in a child\u2019s best interests. a parenting order can encompass and deal with all aspects of a child\u2019s care, welfare and development, or any aspect relating to the parental responsibility for a child. in making any parenting order the court must have regard to the aims of the legislation set out in section 60b(1), which provides as follows: (a) ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children. the principles underpinning the aims of the legislation are contained in section 60b(2) which provides: (a) children have the right to know and be cared for by both their parents, regardless of whether their parents are married, separated, have never married or have never lived together, and (b) children have a right to spend time on a regular basis with, and communicate on a regular basis with, both their parents and other people significant to their care, welfare and development (such as grandparents and other relatives), and (c) parents jointly share duties and responsibilities concerning the care, welfare and development of their children, and (d) parents should agree about the future parenting of their children, and (e) children have a right to enjoy their culture (including the right to enjoy that culture with other people who share that culture). in determining what is in a child\u2019s best interest, the court is to have regard to a long list of considerations set out in section 60cc of the act. those considerations are separated into primary considerations and secondary considerations. the primary considerations to which the court is to give greater weight are: (a) the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence the additional considerations are: (a) any views expressed by the child and any factors (such as the child\u2019s maturity or level of understanding) that the court thinks are relevant to the weight it should give to the child\u2019s views, (b) the nature of the relationship of the child with: (i) each of the child\u2019s parents, and (ii) other persons (including any grandparent or other relative of the child), (c) the extent to which each of the child\u2019s parents has taken, or failed to take, the opportunity: (i) to participate in making decisions about major long term issues in relation to the child, and (ii) to spend time with the child, and (iii) to communicate with the child, ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring that parents fulfil their duties, and meet their responsibilities, concerning the care, welfare and development of their children.

the law to the facts [y] lives with his paternal grandparents in [country n]. he has done so since [late] 2016. that is, for 6.5 years of his 8.5-year life. he attends a boarding school. he is an accomplished [musician]. his unambiguous wish is to remain in [country n] with his grandparents. the father has maintained consistent evidence about the plan devised by he and the mother prior to leaving [y] in [country n] for him to undertake his primary education in that country and return to australia to commence his secondary education in about 2026. the mother and father travelled to [country n] with [y] in [late] 2016 and jointly applied in [city j] for a visa to allow [y] to stay in [country n] with his grandparents. [y] is not only an accomplished [musician], but he has received multiple scholastic awards including certificates of honour and achievement awards. in the father\u2019s submission, it would simply be devastating for [y] to forcibly remove him from all that he knows and loves in [country n] so as to bring him back to australia now. to do so would visit upon him undeniable psychological harm in the short, medium and long term. in his oral evidence the single expert, [dr g], said the following : \u2019s primary attachment figure is his paternal grandmother. that\u2019s right, isn\u2019t it? well, the \u2013 attachments is a \u2013 a \u2013 a difficult concept. i \u2013 i think it\u2019s safe to say that the paternal grandmother is the person to whom [y] is \u2013 is closest and \u2013 and most emotionally connected, yes. sure. i think you\u2019ve included in your report, at paragraph 31, that he told you that she was \u2013 meaning, the paternal grandmother, was the most important person in his life. do you remember writing that? yes, yes. and it will be a harrowing process for him. and there\u2019s \u2013 there\u2019s no other way to put it, that that will end what he has known most of his life. am i right in saying that there would be some short, medium and long-term effects if that were to happen, visited upon [y]? yes. so is that right, firstly? there\u2019s ? i \u2013 i think that that\u2019s right. i think that in the short-term, for example, he would immediately feel some loss of his routine and the relationships that he has in [country n]. and he would be sad about that, is that fair? yes. right. medium-term, there might well be, beyond that initial sadness, like, a grief that might end up in him \u2013 i think you\u2019ve touched upon this earlier today in questions from my learned friend, in your answers, that there could well be a real basis for him becoming difficult, acting out, defiant ? yes. all that? yes. and then looking at the long-term, if that \u2013 i\u2019m using the word \u201cattachment\u201d. but i understand your meaning of the \u2013 anyway, the relationship between he and his paternal grandmother \u2013 if that\u2019s broken now, i\u2019m suggesting there might also \u2013 in the longer term, he might develop or have difficulty with his mental health in the long term such as suffering from anxiety or depression, that\u2019s possible too, isn\u2019t it? it is possible. the father\u2019s preferred orders reflect his case that, in line with [y]\u2019s expectation and wish, he remain in [country n] to finish his primary education (but spending time and communicating with his parents and brother in australia) until moving to [city j] to live with his parents thereafter. in that way, the known, guaranteed or certain risk to [y] of psychological harm of the forced move now is avoided versus the possible risk of the loss of the relationship between the mother and [y] by allowing that time in [country n] to occur as planned. in summary, the court is obliged to give greater weight to the primary considerations and, within them, to protect children from psychological harm. in circumstances whereby the father\u2019s proposal ensures the benefit to [y] in maintaining his relationships with both his parents but avoid the harm that will come from a forced move away from his settled home now the court would prefer those orders. in respect to the child [x], the father\u2019s proposal is to gradually increase the time he is to spend with him over some 7 months. in respect of that proposal [dr g] gave the following evidence: you recall that. yes. again, do you have a copy of the father\u2019s preferred orders there, the minute? anyway, i will take you through it, [dr g]. what he\u2019s suggesting to the court should occur is that, for a period of four weeks \u2013 because you understand he has only seen \u2013 i think my learned friend put to you the status quo remains and he\u2019s having three hours with [x] each week. what he\u2019s suggesting would happen, [dr g], is that for a period of four weeks [x] spends time with him from 9 o\u2019clock in the morning on sunday until 4 o\u2019clock that afternoon? yes. and then for a period of three months, in week 1, from saturday at 10 o\u2019clock until sunday 10 o\u2019clock \u2013 sorry, 5 o\u2019clock sunday. so saturday morning, sunday afternoon in the first week? yes and then in the second week, from after school on wednesday until the commencement of school the following thursday? yes. and then for a period of three months after that, in the first week, from after school friday until before school monday. and then in the second week, from after school wednesday until the commencement of school on friday. so just pausing there. the regime increases but that\u2019s a fairly graduated increase of the father\u2019s time, isn\u2019t it, with [x], do you agree? yes. and would you agree with me that that\u2019s both child-focused and appropriate? yes. of course [x] would also stand to suffer should [y] be forced back to australia against his wishes. it is plain that such a transition would be a volatile and difficult one. [x] would be in the middle of such conflict. again, [dr g] opined: and it\u2019s going to be \u2013 that situation, if that were to happen, would be bad for [x] too, wouldn\u2019t it, because [x]\u2019s going to be stuck in the middle of it? yes. there \u2013 almost certainly there will be \u2013 there will be a toll and encumbrance on the young \u2013 on the younger of the two children. i guess it\u2019s how \u2013 how long that extinction burst lasts for. extinction bursts are a very well researched behaviour phenomena where you introduce the change or the intervention or the shift and if it\u2019s contrary to a child\u2019s, you know, pretty concrete views, there can be a spike in, you know, behaviour outbursts and difficulty and rejection and resistance and all those sorts of things. it depends on how long that lasts for. if that \u2013 if that extinction burst is \u2013 and there\u2019s difficulties over months and months and months, then, obviously, there\u2019s a cumulative impact on little [x]. but if it\u2019s more short-term, so weeks, i think that that\u2019s probably \u2013 probably bearable given the potential benefits that could flow from restoring the sibling relationship. property: the law in determining an application under s 79, the court must be satisfied it is just and equitable to make an order adjusting the property interests of the parties (s 79(2)) and it must consider each of the matters set out in s 79(4)(e). it has long been the approach to employ the \u201cfour step process\u201d set forth in hickey and hickey and attorney general for the commonwealth of australia (intervener) [2003] famca 395, (2003) flc 93-143, as follows: identify and value, the parties' property, liabilities and financial resources at the date1. of the hearing, identify and assess the contributions of the parties as referred to in s.79 of the act and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties, whether examined on a global approach or an asset by asset approach, identify and assess the other factors relevant including, the matters referred to in s.75 of the act and determine the adjustment (if any) to be made to the contribution entitlements at step two, and consider the effect of the above and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case. in stanford & stanford (2012) 247 clr 108 (\u201cstanford\u201d) the high court made clear at [37] it is necessary to begin consideration of whether it is just and equitable to make a property settlement order by identifying, according to ordinary common law and equitable principles, the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties in the property. the full court in bevan & bevan [2013] famcafc 116, (2013) flc 93-545 (\u201cbevan\u201d) at [72]\u2013[73] has held that the decision in stanford has not overruled the four step approach. stanford made clear that requirement pursuant to s 79(2) that it would be \u201cjust and equitable\u201d to make orders altering property should not be conflated with the requirements of s 79(4). the full court in bevan emphasised that although the pre-condition to making any order for property adjustment is a finding that it is just and equitable to do so in accordance with s 79(2) of the act, such a finding does not form a threshold issue, nor must the requirements of s 79 be followed in a particular order. stanford also emphasised that the discretion reposed in the court by s 79 must be exercised judicially (at [38]). at [39], the court expressly emphasised that in australian law there is no concept of \u201ccommunity ownership\u201d arising from marriage and whether it is \u201cjust and equitable\u201d to make an order \u201cis not to be answered by assuming that the parties\u2019 rights to or interests in marital property are or should be different from those that then exist\u201d. the very fact of separation may lead to the ready satisfaction of just and equitable requirement: stanford at [41]\u2013[42]. property: application of the law to the facts at the commencement of cohabitation the father had the [suburb d] and [suburb w] properties which are now valued at a combined agreed $2,260,000. he also had motor vehicles, some superannuation, household goods and personal possessions. the mother had little assets and agreed in cross-examination that she had at cohabitation less than about $50,000 standing to her name. any assessment of contributions is, however, in this case, otiose. unfortunately for the parties, from the outset of the relationship the father already had a considerable debt ($2.6m) owed to his parents: see annexure j to the father\u2019s trial affidavit. that loan agreement was executed in [mid]-2011 (almost 3 years prior to cohabitation) by the father and his parents and fathered by lawyers. its authenticity was not successfully challenged, and it must be a finding that the father remains in the debt of his parents to that extent. the monies loaned from his parents were applied to the purchase of the 2 pieces of real property, living and accommodation expenses, business expenses and the father\u2019s tertiary education in australia. further, beyond the a$2.6m the subject of the loan, further monies were loaned to the father from his parents to cover business and household expenses during the marriage. the mother conceded as much in cross-examination. i want to suggest to you that the reason you were able to keep things afloat and to keep living the way you were living was partly because [mr rong] was receiving lots of money from his parents. is that fair?---yes. [t:243] the evidence of the father being annexure k to his trial affidavit (being not objected to section 50 ea summaries of loan advances to the husband from his parents) add further significant amounts to the outstanding debt (for example, over $1,220,777 for living expenses, [business] expenses and mortgage re-payments) beyond the a$2.6m. the effect of the legitimate loans owed by the father to his parents is to make nugatory the balance sheet. the parties have a negative asset pool. beyond the orders sought by the father in terms of the parties retaining the assets and / or liabilities in their respective possession, there should be no other orders in respect to property made. it is the father\u2019s case, and respectfully the court would find, that it would not be just and equitable for there to be any property adjustment. written submissions on behalf of the mother the evidence of the father concerning communication & attitude the father\u2019s evidence in the father box confirmed his negative view of the mother and his non-existent communication with her. the lack of communication extended over a lengthy period and related to important issues, including not troubling himself to tell the mother that her son had commenced school as a boarder in [country n] other than through his lawyers and after the mother had enquired. he enunciated his position that the mother held little interest in the children and only in money, which he alleged was \u2018always her first thought\u2019. he accepted that he thought the mother was uneducated and had called her such. he could not accept that the mother loved [y] because she held a different view of his best interests than his. he thought that the proceedings were being pursued by the mother purely to obtain centrelink benefits. the attitudes were, as observed by the single expert, entrenched. the father\u2019s evidence was that he had not considered the impact of these attitudes, which he had communicated to the mother, because they were \u2018the truth\u2019 in his eyes. he reiterated that if he was telling the truth, it did not matter to him what the impact of his saying negative things might be on the mother, even though it affected [x]. the focus of the father\u2019s view seemed to be his rigid determination that [y] should remain in [country n]. his rigidity generally, as well as on this subject, was a remarkable feature of his evidence. the father expressed that a [country n] education was the most important thing for the children. he seemed unable to consider any viewpoint not his own. this was particularly notable given the evidence of the single expert regarding the range of developmental impacts for both children in a situation where [y] remains living in [country n]. ultimately, his view of the matter appeared to be that the only way anyone could express love for [y] was to do what [y] wanted, a troubling proposition where [y] is aged 8 years. certainly, the father could articulate no plan he had or thought necessary to improve his communication with the mother. the rigidity of thinking was not confined to the matter surrounding [y]. unfortunately, it permeated much of the father\u2019s evidence, not least his concession that he did not spend time with [x] that the mother offered him before the interim hearing of the matter as he did not consider that time sufficient. the father extended that rigidity to giving evidence that the children needed to be told \u2018the truth\u2019 that their mother was \u2018a bad mother\u2019 when they were adults. concerning the children the father\u2019s evidence concerning the children exhibited a similar rigidity in his attitude towards the mother. the father could not see or understand any possibility other than [y] remaining in [country n] until the completion of primary school. the father was unable to understand or contemplate the difficulty in espousing the view that [y] should stay in [country n] because he wants to now and his view that it was impossible that [y] should ever want to stay in [country n] after the conclusion of primary school. the father gave evidence that it did not matter what anyone else thought. he would do nothing to have [y] return from [country n]. he believed that at age 8, [y] could decide what country he should live in. the father expressed no qualms that his mother was following whatever [y]\u2019s views were and saw no difficulty with that course of action. the approach generally to [y] by the father concerning the orders for [y]\u2019s return was also a point of concern from the father\u2019s evidence. the father appeared to superficially acknowledge that the orders for [y] had not been complied with and, despite having been gaoled for non-compliance, rigidly adhered to the rightness of his position. the father admitted to doing effectively nothing substantive at all to comply with the orders made for the return of [y] to australia. his evidence inspired little confidence that his proposed orders for [y] to spend holiday time with the mother would ever result in time occurring. beyond [y], the father had an unrealistic and impractical view concerning [x]. his wish to spend more time with [x] did not extend to giving thought to the need to detail how he would feed [x] or how he would reduce his work hours to allow his proposal to take effect so he could care for [x]. almost at every stage for the father, there was a lack of planning and reflection on [x] as an individual with needs that will grow and evolve. the father\u2019s evidence, in totality, displayed very little consideration of [x] and gave very little detail concerning his perception and knowledge of [x] as a person. the most concerning aspect of the father\u2019s evidence concerned his perceptions of the relationship between [y] and [x]. he did not consider that relationship important in what he termed \u2018the current situation\u2019. he held a view that somehow the siblings would rebuild a relationship if they continued to be raised in different cultures and with different languages. the basis for this view or hope was not articulated. allegations of family violence the father made serious allegations of family violence against the mother. concerning one particular incident, he alleged that the mother had on at least two occasions on a single event thrown a kitchen knife at him, broken a chopping board, and hurled [food] and both halves of the chopping board into the backyard of their property, all whilst holding a child in her arms. the father\u2019s descriptions were improperly evidenced and physically impossible for the mother to have done in the manner described. further, on at least two occasions of incidents of violence, the father had open to him a family member of his own he could have brought to court to verify his version of events, and he did not do so. conversely, the father admitted to denigrating the mother during the relationship in his evidence. his attitude in the father box towards the mother pointed directly towards many of the contentions made by the mother concerning the father\u2019s behaviour during the relationship. indeed, the father\u2019s rigidity regarding [y], if seen through his prism of the mother only being interested in money, centrelink, and child support, can only point towards the coercive nature of his proposals. the evidence of the single expert the evidence of [dr g] provided significant illumination. the father\u2019s submissions have selectively quoted from [dr g]\u2019s evidence and ignored large swathes of opinion that point squarely away from the father\u2019s case. key amongst his evidence are the following matters: - that if [y] is returned to australia, he will suffer a series of adverse effects, that the expert maintained [y] should be returned to australia despite his expressed views and that [y] feeling ignored or not listened to is part and parcel of being a child of that age, that the expert balanced the impact on [y] of being brought back against the view that if he returned as proposed by the father, his opportunity to have a meaningful relationship with the mother and [x] would have closed and be irrecoverable, given the father\u2019s contravention of orders, there is a significant question mark over whether the father would choose to follow his own proposal if made by the court, that the father\u2019s proposal did not allow the mother to have any real or immersive connection with her son, nor did it allow [y] and [x] to have a real or immersive connection, that the father\u2019s attitudes towards the mother are counterfactual and, at times, absurd in the extreme, that his view was that equal shared parental responsibility was not appropriate on the evidence that he had now seen about the father\u2019s entrenched attitude, empowering [y] in the way proposed by the father had significant developmental detriments for [y], that [y] and [x] play an important role in the formation of each other\u2019s identities, and the longer they are kept separate, the more problematic it is for each of the children, that the father would need to be able to manage any increase in time with [x] with sensitivity for it to be successful for [x], that the father presented as an under-resourced parent with a lack of reflective ability, that there is a significant concern that [y] was directly coached for his interview and being inappropriately alienated or involved in proceedings by the paternal family, and that there were unambiguous markers of a deliberate campaign by the paternal family to extricate [y] from the mother\u2019s sphere of influence. the court child expert\u2019s evidence succinctly and fairly set out the risks for these children. he sensitively expressed a view as to their balance and concluded that the children should live with the mother. the evidence of the mother the mother\u2019s evidence was open, honest, and demonstrated a significant degree of insight. she made reasonable concessions that she did not have to make. she impressed as a mother who wanted desperately to see [y] and had tried hard to work with the father against strident opposition from him. unlike the father, the mother was able to concede to a degree of fault, whereas the father could not readily admit to any parenting weakness. the mother acknowledged sensitively the difficulties for each of the children in living with her and expressed appropriate management strategies for the reintroduction of [y] and [x] as well as managing any defiance on [x]\u2019s part. she explained the flexible recourse she would have to experts to deal with the difficulty and listed the range of supports she had set up to prepare for such an event. overall, her evidence impressed as child-focused and realistic regarding the challenges she would face if her orders were made. parental responsibility sole parental responsibility should fall to the mother. the parties simply have no proper ability to communicate and meet the requirements for s 61da to operate as set out in marvel & marvel (no 2) [2010] famcafc 101. beyond that, the father\u2019s admission to denigrating the mother in his evidence would bring the matter within s 61da(2). that is particularly so where it could be cogently argued that the father doing little, if anything, to facilitate [y]\u2019s return from [country n] represents further coercive and controlling behaviour on the part of the father. meaningful relationship the mother asserts that both of the children benefit from a meaningful relationship with her. the father effectively denies the proposition. the father\u2019s orders are not such that he would have a meaningful relationship with [y]. the single expert supports the mother\u2019s view that each of the children will benefit from a meaningful relationship with their mother, despite any future challenges that [y] may pose. the benefits to both the children are long-term and short-term benefits that simply cannot be met on the father's proposal, not just due to the tyranny of distance but also due to the attitude of the father and his family to the mother. in these circumstances, the only way the children can enjoy the benefit of that meaningful relationship with each of their parents is through the mother\u2019s orders. risks the balance of risk points squarely towards the mother's proposal. there are several complex risks in this matter set out in the case outline of the mother. the three most prominent risks are the risk of serious psychological harm falling within the definition of abuse to each of the children of being denied a sibling relationship, the risks of serious psychological harm to each of the children of [y] being denied a meaningful relationship with each of his parents, and the risk to [y] of being exposed to serious psychological harm by way of a deliberate campaign to extract [y] form the life of the mother. dealing with the first of those risks, the single expert outlined at length the psychological impacts of being denied that relationship for each of the children. the father's proposal allows no real opportunity to build a relationship. the idea that one of any quality can be built where the children have grown up in entirely different cultures with entirely different languages warrants an almost intemperate description. the notion is flawed. it is unsupported by any evidence. it relies on a misplaced and unsupported hope on the father's part. it relies on a faulty parenting premise that somehow an agreement about a child's education in [country n] that allegedly occurred prior to the parent's separation could be relied upon by everyone in any possible permutation of circumstances. such a position may be culturally influenced, and to that extent, it might, if one is generous, be understandable, but it is not child-focused. the orders the mother proposes directly address this risk, which is a real and not remote possibility. the harm that will be caused to these children by the father's proposal can be ameliorated by the mother's proposal. dealing with the second risk, the expert similarly outlined the risk to [y] of being denied a meaningful relationship with each of his parents. somewhat strangely, the emphasis is appropriately placed on the word 'each' because the father's proposal does not allow for the father to have a meaningful relationship with [y]. the mother's proposal focuses on the long-term benefits for [y] in his life beyond education. the long-term and short-term risks for [y] of not having a meaningful relationship with each of his parents are significant, and those risks are real, and in action the longer [y] is kept in [country n]. dealing with the third risk, the single expert has confirmed this risk is significant, and it is certainly not one that is remote. the risk is corrosive and amounts to the abuse of [y]. attributing fault for those circumstances is less important than ameliorating the effect upon [y]. it could not be seriously believed that if the father successfully pursues his relief, that will somehow ameliorate the pressure on [y]. quite the opposite. that is particularly so where there appears to be such an absolute conviction that [y] will return at the conclusion of primary school, where such conviction simply seems nonsensical in light of the justification for keeping [y] in [country n]. on the one hand, the father says [y] wants to stay, so that is the end of the matter, yet on the other hand, he says at the end of primary school, if [y] wants to stay, he does not get to because school in [country n] after that age is \"very stressful\". being as kind as one can to the father, the stress to his own child under the father's psychologically damaging proposal is perhaps a focus for the child that should be given greater priority. likely effect on the children the likely effect on the children of the mother\u2019s proposal is significant. the proposal will be disruptive for each of the children. the mother has set out a careful and sensitive plan to deal with those matters in her evidence. the mother was realistic about those difficulties in her evidence. however, the mother points towards the benefits to the children of having a relationship between them. the mother\u2019s orders allow this to occur, and they guard against any misfortune for [y] in [country n] in circumstances where he is only cared for by two elderly relatives to whom anything might happen at any point. the father\u2019s proposal means that [y] will be more and more distanced from his mother, father, and brother. he will be more and more distanced from the cultural landscape of australia, to which the father proposes a plan that he will return. essentially the father proposes to do everything he can to make [y]\u2019s transition back to this country and his important relationships as difficult as possible if it ever does occur. certainly, the lack of the father\u2019s proper encouragement of the important relationships for [y] to date points towards the inevitable future involved with the father\u2019s proposals. attitude to the responsibilities of parenthood the father's attitude to the responsibilities of parenthood is deficient. the father's reflective ability is limited, and he appears to be disjointed from the realities of everyday parenting. such an approach is consistent with the mother's evidence concerning the father's lack of involvement in the children's early lives. the father's approach to the orders of the court for [y]\u2019s return and the staunch maintenance of his view, even having been gaoled that his perception of [y]\u2019s best interests should overrule everyone elses has within it the seeds of further deficiencies in his attitude. those deficiencies are not a matter of assigning priorities but extend beyond that to a lack of recognition of his responsibilities and obligations to the children. the father at no point led any cogent evidence to suggest he made any substantive attempt to challenge his mother's views and domination of [y]. rather, the evidence demonstrates he has chosen to abrogate responsibilities. the contrast with the mother could not be more stark. the mother has facilitated the orders without demur. the mother has done so even in circumstances where the father chose not to comply with the orders, and one could have understood if there was a measure of retaliation. the mother has even facilitated the father seeing the child when the father was incarcerated. the mother demonstrates a remarkable sensitivity to her responsibilities and the benefits for the children on these facts alone before one turns to her careful and child-focussed evidence. views troublingly, the father\u2019s case seemed to propound that [y], being 8 years old, got to make major decisions about his own life. the difficulty of this approach and of placing weight on this view was aptly set out by the single expert and was done so before the issue of the coaching of [y] was dealt with. any position that says that [y]\u2019s views should be determinative or should form the basis for a risk that would cause the father\u2019s orders to be preferred is not only unsupported by the evidence but is refuted by the clear immaturity and lack of rational basis for [y]\u2019s own views as expressed to the single expert. other matters the mother seeks orders for the father to undertake a range of courses to improve his parenting. these were recommended by the single expert. the father completely ignored that recommendation. those orders can only benefit the children and should be made. there is a question about the enforceability of any orders for [y] to return to australia in the face of the father\u2019s resistance. the reality is that the court is enjoined to make the orders that are in the best interests of children and not those that a person may agree with or are those which are the best enforceable orders that can be made. the mother\u2019s position is that the orders should be made on the basis of best interests with the focus on the children and those orders being within power rather than casting a lens of enforceability. brief responses the father asserts that returning [y] to australia would be ''undeniably devastating'' because it involves removal from ''all he knows and loves in [country n] . that position is meaningless in terms of the assistance it offers the court. that is because the father's evidence is that he plans to apply such devastation in any event when the child completes primary school by returning the child to australia. the issue is simply a matter of timing, not the return to australia if the father's evidence is to be believed. it is difficult to understand how he says that is better done later when there could be no proper characterisation of the single expert's evidence other than it is better that [y] is returned now rather than later. this aspect of the father\u2019s case is particularly perplexing where the father says, on his proposal, [y] shall have week about between the parties on his return to australia. clearly the father trusted the mother to significantly manage any upset from [y]. the father asserts that the risk of a loss of relationships for [y] is a ''possibility''. to suggest that such a risk is merely a possibility in light of the single experts evidence is to misconstrue the evidence. the submission engages in an artificial weighing of certain risks again possible risks. the legislative framework provides no such delineation, nor should it, the task the court is enjoined with is to weigh all the possible risks and reaches a decision that best balances them to achieve an outcome that is in the best interests of each of the children. given the evidence, the conclusion can only be that the mother's proposal best reflects the appropriate balance. the father's suggestion that his proposal allows [y] to have a relationship with each of his parents is simply nonsense. that is before one turns to the reality that the words of the legislation refer to a ''meaningful relationship'' and not merely a ''relationship''. the position reflects no understanding at all of the longstanding authority that aptly describes the features of a meaningful relationship. that authority was available to the father, as it is cited in the case outline of the mother. the reality is that there is no reading of the respectful and learned commentary of brown j in mazorski & allbright [2007] famca 520, (2008) 37 fam lr 518, approved by the full court in mccall & clark [2009] famcafc 92, [2009] flc 93-405 that could possibly support the assertion that the father's proposal allowed for a meaningful relationship. the father's suggestion that the single expert supported his proposal for [x] was based on the transcript of a father affirming that he understood that was the proposal was concerning. any proper evaluation of the totality of the evidence of the single expert could not rationally conclude that the father's proposal for equal time with [x] was supported, realistic, or reasonable, let alone in [x]\u2019s best interests. property matters assets, liabilities and superannuation of the parties the parties agree that the following are assets of the relationship: husband\u2019s [suburb d] property - $985,000 husband\u2019s [suburb w] property - $1,275,000 husband\u2019s 1% interest in [rong pty ltd] - $5,157 wife\u2019s [motor vehicle 2] - $31,000 husband\u2019s [motor vehicle 3] - $30,000 both the husband and wife have minimal savings. there is no dispute that these savings have been accrued by both of them post-separation. both parties have modest household goods, including for the husband\u2019s [games] collection. both have some superannuation. the wife has approximately $113,574, and the husband has $33,543 (per his affidavit). there are two liabilities asserted by the husband: an amount of $29,136 that he owes as a director\u2019s penalty for [rong pty ltd], and a loan from his parents. the wife accepts that the husband owes the director\u2019s penalty but does not accept that a penalty he accrued in his capacity as a director of the company and not in his personal capacity is properly a debt of the relationship. there is no reason why the wife should share in the payment of this penalty. both parties agree that she did not have any role in or oversight of the business, and the husband himself is only a 1% shareholder. the wife does not accept that the husband has a valid loan payable to his parents. she does accept that he has received money from them both before and during the relationship and as such, this will properly be assessed as a contribution made by them on his behalf. the loan(s) from the husband\u2019s parents the husband asserts he owes his parents the rather specific sum of $6,080,901.40. he has not been able to provide the court with an accurate accounting of how he arrives at this figure, or any consistent or cogent explanation of it. his position is that this sum is pursuant to a loan agreement between himself and his parents from 2011 which represented funds they had already given him, but they have also provided the amounts set out in annexure k to his affidavit (some of which predate the agreement). in support of his position, the husband provides a loan agreement signed by himself and his parents on an unspecified date in 2011 for the sum of $2.6 million. there are significant factors that point away from this being considered a valid loan agreement: the agreement is undated (other than a typed reference to 2011 at the top), both the husband and his mother have asserted they have difficulties regarding the english language and required a translator, yet the document does not purport to have been translated or interpreted in any way. the solicitor who prepared and counter signed the document gave no evidence of their perception of the parties\u2019 understanding or what had been explained about the agreement. the husband gave evidence that there was no one translating when he and his mother signed it the risk of it being capable of being set aside on this ground alone by either party to the agreement should the matter be litigated would, it is submitted, be considerable, no attempt has been made to enforce the terms of the loan or its ongoing repayment \u2013 the husband made some ad hoc small payments from 2019 for coinciding with separation and challenges to his child support assessment, and the terms of the loan have not been complied with in relation to how much the parents could provide on an ongoing basis. any action to enforce repayment of the loan would be statute-barred. the limitation period would be 6 years. for loans repayable on demand, the cause of action first accrues at the time the monies were advanced. it would not be appropriate to include the loan in the balance sheet as part of the current liabilities of the husband because he could avoid payment of that liability claiming it is statute-barred. his affidavit evidence, and that which he gave orally, was to the effect that the $2.6 million had already been given to him before he signed the loan agreement and that he brought this debt into the relationship. his evidence was that he could not produce any documents showing his actual receipt of this particular sum as it was advanced in smaller amounts over the years since he had arrived in australia (being from late 2001 to the signing of the agreement in 2011) and involved things like paying for educational, accommodation and living expenses. the husband\u2019s evidence is that he never saw or was provided with any evidence that demonstrated to him that this was indeed the sum that he had received from his parents (as it was cumulative), he just trusted his mother\u2019s word that this was the case and his lawyer did not take steps to obtain such information and provide it to him. the husband had no memory of who was present for the signing of the loan agreement. he gave evidence that his lawyer (who is also his lawyer in these proceedings) was also his mother\u2019s lawyer for the loan agreement. this was incorrect and was clarified with him in cross-examination by counsel for the wife. he accepted that he must have been mistaken about this but did not seem to have much in the way of recollection of the circumstances around the signing of the agreement. the figures set out in annexure k of the husband\u2019s affidavit were not supported by primary evidence of bank statements, deposit slips, transfer documentation etc that would prove that the funds asserted were actually received. however, even if it was accepted that each of the sums asserted was received by the husband, this does not make them either funds loaned to the husband, or a debt of the relationship. some key issues in relation to these asserted \u201cloan\u201d amounts in annexure k are as follows: all of the figures pre-2011 were presumably part of the $2.6 million the husband had received by the time the purported loan agreement came into existence sometime in 2011. to include these sums again in the amount owing would be to double count them. funds provided for the parties\u2019 wedding would be characterised as a gift to both of them and not a loan that anyone needs to pay back. over $50,000 was purportedly provided for shares in 2016. the husband\u2019s evidence appears to be that he engaged in online trading and lost it all. significant sums (in fact the vast majority of the amounts set out in annexure k) were associated with [rong pty ltd] and not the husband in his personal capacity. these could not be properly included. significant sums were for legal fees associated with these proceedings. these could not be properly included. sums for his dental treatments post separation (of which there was absolutely no evidence) could not properly be characterised as debts of the relationship. quite why the funds advanced to the business are repayable by the husband who owns 1% of the business and no sum is repayable by his brother who owns 99% of the business remained entirely unexplained. in truth, the funds provided by the husband\u2019s parents for the benefit of the business should have been recorded as a loan to the business and become a debt of the business. the husband, and his family, appeared to have little regard for (or perhaps little understanding of) concepts of separate legal entities, or basic accounting principles. it was eventually established that the director\u2019s loan listed in the company accounts is not payable to the husband. the husband did not know what a director\u2019s loan was, but his brother did, and his evidence was that the director\u2019s loan was payable to him. the husband accepted that there was no way he could ever realistically pay back a sum of this kind (or even the $2.6 million in the agreement) to his parents. it is submitted that this could hardly come as a surprise to his parents who had also been propping up the [rong pty ltd] business and are well aware of the dire financial circumstances of this entity. it is submitted that this is not a bona fide loan and that a document was created as a fig leaf with a fictional number provided by the husband\u2019s parents for their own purposes. it cannot be definitively asserted what these purposes were, and speculation would not be proper or advance this case. suffice it to say that it is clear from all of the evidence that the husband has been, throughout his time in australia, a puppet or conduit for his mother\u2019s financial manoeuvrings. he does not understand them and appears to have had very little, if any, say in them. to assert that there is no valid loan however is not the same thing as to deny that the husband\u2019s parents made contributions to the property pool. this is undeniably so. financial contributions by the husband\u2019s parents the evidence from the few historical bank statements produced by the husband indicates that his parents provided him with approximately $400,000 for the purchase of the [suburb d] property and approximately $700,000 for the purchase of the [suburb w] property. it does not appear that the husband contributed any of his own money to these properties. he owned these properties before cohabitation. the husband could not explain why the [suburb w] property sat vacant for so long (from sometime in 2013 to sometime in 2017) while the husband's brother lived with the parties. he indicated there were issues with the intercom and some fencing for a dog but primarily the issue was that the brothers needed their parent's permission for [mr bb] to move into the property, and for some reason that remained unclear, this was not provided until 2017. it does appear that the husband's brother is now paying some rent to reside in the property \u2013 which would be income of the husband, though whether this is being declared is difficult to say. the husband\u2019s parents made contributions from time to time to the living expenses of the parties. they have also paid for the maintenance and education of [y], albeit in recent years while retaining him in [country n] contrary to repeated orders of this court. while it may well be the case that the husband\u2019s parents also provided him (and/or his brother) with funds to establish and keep afloat their business, funds advanced to a commercial entity for the use of that entity is not the same thing as a contribution to the matrimonial property pool. contributions \u2013 the wife\u2019s case the wife accepts that the husband brought the [suburb d] and [suburb w] properties into the relationship. she does not accept that he owed his parents $2.6 million dollars. on this scenario he made greater initial financial contributions. throughout the relationship both parties worked. it is an agreed fact that the wife earned more than the husband throughout the relationship, even taking into account her periods out of the workforce on maternity leave to care for the parties two children, but that the husband\u2019s parents did provide them with some funds to assist with living expenses and paid some of [y]\u2019s expenses. the wife made greater non-financial contributions as parent and homemaker, including in relation to the husband\u2019s brother living with them rent-free when he could have been residing in the empty [suburb w] property. the wife submits that the parties made equal but different contributions throughout the relationship. post separation neither party has had to pay accommodation costs. the wife has had the far greater responsibility for the care of [x] and the husband has paid some child support. the wife submits she has made higher post-separation contributions. the wife\u2019s case is that contributions should be assessed as 80% to the husband based on his initial contributions (made on his behalf by his parents) and the sporadic contributions made by his parents to the parties living expenses during the relationship and 20% to the wife. she then seeks a future needs adjustment as detailed below. despite repeated questions from both counsel for the wife, and his honour ,the husband could not indicate what contributions percentage he considered appropriate. the written submissions on his behalf do nothing to clarify this, and we are left with the position that his case is unclear other than that he says there should be no adjustment to the wife. future needs the husband appears to have a lower earning capacity than the wife. he could earn a wage working for somebody else in [hospitality] rather than in his own business, so even should his company be wound up he is not unable to work. his income variability limits his ability to contribute significantly by way of payment of child support. at the time of the trial he was in arrears for over $5000. the wife will have far greater responsibility for the care of [x] who is still young. she seeks that [y] return to her care and that she will also be primarily responsible for his care. the husband has the benefit of the financial resources that he asserts in his evidence that he has routinely received since he moved to australia. on his evidence his parents have given him nearly $6 million dollars. though his evidence is now that they will not assist him further, the court would find it difficult to accept that following these proceedings and once the family is outside the eye of the court that the pattern of a lifetime would alter. the wife submits that an adjustment to her of 15% to account for the lack of child support, greater care of the children, and to account for the far superior financial resources of the husband is appropriate. if the court does not order that [y] is to return to australia in the near future then the wife will still need to meet the costs of his care when he does return, as well as the therapeutic supports that it does not appear to be controversial that he will require upon his return. [y]\u2019s father and grandparents have certainly made no offer to meet or contribute to the costs of any such supports so these too are likely to fall to the mother to pay for. what each party seeks the husband seeks that each party retain the assets and liabilities in their own names. this would mean that the wife would retain her car, any post separation savings, her household and personal goods and superannuation. this would amount to a total combined pool of assets and superannuation of approximately $169,520 as at the time of hearing (based on bank account balances proximate to trial). the husband would retain both the [suburb d] and [suburb w] properties unencumbered, his shares in [rong pty ltd], his car, his post separation saving, his personal and household goods and his superannuation. this would amount to a total combined pool of assets and superannuation of approximately $2,300,086 as at the time of hearing (based on bank account balances proximate to trial). the husband asserts that this means that he would in fact have nothing as he owes more that the total of these assets to his parents. the wife says that this is a false reflection of the financial reality as he would still be living in the house, driving the car and spending the money as he would not, in fact, be paying back the asserted loan. if liabilities are not taken into account (as the wife says they ought not to be) then this would be a division of 7% to he wife and 93% to the husband. the wife\u2019s position is that she should receive 35% of the total pool ($864,362), and that taking into account the $169,520 she has in her own name, the remaining $694,842 should be made as a cash payment by the husband. in addition the wife seeks that the husband be ordered to pay her the amount owing as a result of the outstanding costs order made in the contravention proceedings, being$21,719.20. justice and equity if no adjustment is made then the wife would own no real estate to house herself and the children of the relationship. she would receive no cash to assist her to acquire a property for them to live in (or to pay rent if she so chose). she would have superannuation that she could not access for some considerable time. she would have some post separation savings and a motor vehicle she purchase post separation. she would obtain no benefit from the matrimonial pool and her contributions both financial and as a parent and homemaker would be unacknowledged. the husband would have an unencumbered property to live in. he would own unencumbered the property his brother and his family live in and have the benefit (potentially, depending upon what arrangements his mother allowed) of any rental income from that property. enforcement the husband makes no submissions concerning how he says any orders of the court should operate or be enforced if the court does not make the orders he seeks, which is for no adjustment to the wife. he does not contemplate any situation in which he does not get what he wants, and thus provides the court with no practical assistance on the issue. the husband should be ordered to pay the funds to the wife in a specified amount in a specified timeframe and be permitted to identify the manner in which he sources those funds. he could, as an alternative, choose to transfer one of the properties to her. the difficulty with the transfer option is that the wife concedes that this is likely to mean that she needs to make a cash payment back to him given the value of the property. this is not impossible, but no evidence was led at trial on this issue. if the husband is unable or unwilling to make the payment from borrowing against the properties or borrowing from his family, then the most appropriate option may be a default sale order the he sell the [suburb w] property (in which his brother resides). if the husband\u2019s brother wants to purchase it he can always do so. the amount the husband sells it for is really up to the husband, so long as he receives the funds necessary to make the ordered payment to the wife. the husband\u2019s parents placed caveats over each of the [suburb d] and [suburb w] properties [in late] 2021. the husband has made no application to lapse these caveats. he can, and should, do so. both properties are held in the husband\u2019s sole name. the wife can make no application to lapse the caveats. the husband can be subjected to an in personam order that he do all things necessary to cause to lapse or procure the removal of the caveats from the properties. given the approach taken by himself and his family towards compliance with court orders unfortunately an order of that kind would not provide the court or the wife with much comfort, but could ground contravention or enforcement proceedings which may provide some remedy, albeit potentially of a different kind. the court could also order him to pay the wife a property settlement by way of instalments and to continue until the sum is paid or it becomes due and payable upon the sale of one of the properties. the difficulty with this is that given the husband\u2019s uncertain income there is no guarantee that this would result in any payments to the wife and would simply lead to further litigation on enforcement. there is no simple solution that would ensure the wife receives a just and equitable division of the parties\u2019 property. it is anticipated based on past experiences that enforcement proceedings may be required. independent children\u2019s lawyer\u2019s written submissions the evidence of the father the icl submits that the court would have significant concerns about the evidence of the father. the father was dogmatic in his view that the most important thing for the children was a good education and that this should priortised over anything else, especially in relation to [y]. the father\u2019s evidence showed a lack of insight into the impacts on the children of remaining separated from each other. the father gave evidence that in his opinion it would not be hard for the brothers to build a relationship upon [y] returning to australia after he finishes his primary education in [country n]. the father gave evidence that [y], at the age of 8, should be the one to decide where he wants to live and that he supports [y]\u2019s decision. the father had no plan of what he would do if [y] refused to return to australia after his primary education was completed or what he would do if the paternal grandmother refused to return [y], as has been occurring to date. the father had no plan about how he would care for [x] if there was a shared care arrangement put in place and he had not considered the most basic things like changing his work arrangements. the father\u2019s attitude towards the mother can only be described as negative and condescending. he gave evidence that he did not think that the mother loved [y] as if she loved him she would let him finish school in [country n] saying \u201cif she really really loved him, let him finish\u201d the father\u2019s view of the mother was that she was only concerned with money and that the reason she wanted [y] returned was to get child support and centrelink payments. when questioned further on this the father\u2019s evidence was that if child support and centrelink were not the reason, then why would she seek for him to come back and \u201cdestroy his life\u201d. the father gave further evidence that he thought it appropriate to tell the children that their mother was only concerned with money. the icl submits that the court cannot have any confidence that the father will comply with any orders that this court makes in relation to [y] and his return to australia. despite having been imprisoned for contravening previous orders, the evidence given by the father remained that [y] should stay in [country n] to complete his primary education and that he has no plans to return [y] to australia prior to this. it is open to the court to find if [y] elected to remain in [country n] after completing his primary education, the father would do nothing to affect his return to australia and would support his son\u2019s views and wishes. the evidence of the mother the icl submits that the court will likely assess the mother\u2019s evidence as open, honest, insightful and credible. the mother made concessions where necessary. it was clear on the evidence of the mother that she is willing to maintain a relationship between the children and the father. she showed insight into the challenges that will face [y], [x]and herself upon [y]\u2019s return to australia. the court would be comforted by the fact that the mother had already made contact with services to assist her with these challenges such as contacting [f centre] for support, making arrangements for psychological sessions for [y] and speaking to her employer about needing time off when [y] returns. the evidence of [dr g] the icl submits that the court will place considerable weight on the evidence of [dr g]. [dr g] remained steadfast in his opinion that [y] be returned to australia and placed in the mother\u2019s care. [dr g] explained the complex dynamics of the decision before the court. [dr g] confirmed in his oral evidence that upon [y] returning to australia there needed to be a moratorium on his contact with the paternal family including the father. [dr g] indicated that the longer [y] remained in [country n] the longer the moratorium needed to be and that if [y] was spending time with his father during the moratorium that he had no confidence that the father would comply with an order that he not bring [y] in contact with the paternal grandparents. [dr g] gave evidence that [x]\u2019s time with his father should continue during any moratorium. [dr g] was balanced and considered in relation to the significant impact on [y] of being returned to australia stating that [y] will experience displacement, feel homesick, yearn connection, be angry, and that it will be a harrowing experience that will upend his life. he was clear there would be an impact on [x] as well. despite this, [dr g] was clear in his evidence that if [y] remained in [country n] to complete his primary education that [y]\u2019s relationship with his mother and brother will be irrecoverable. in relation to the father\u2019s proposal that he would pay for [y] to visit australia 4 weeks a year and that this would help [y]\u2019s connection with his mother and brother [dr g] gave evidence that: two assumptions warrant scrutiny. the first being whether the father would actually follow the proposal and comply with orders. he indicated that the father\u2019s contravention was \u201cnot a positive indicator of him adhering to court\u2019s orders\u201d. the second was whether the mother spending time with [y] for so little time would be enough to form \u201cmeaningful immersive connection\u201d with his mother. [dr g\u2019s] view that the proposed time would not lead to a rekindling of a bond and a loving relationship stating \u201cparent child bonds are not forged through nice experiences but by routine, cuddles, homework, doctor office visits, it\u2019s the mundane regular routine that build meaningful relationships\u201d. [dr g] gave evidence that [x]\u2019s time with his father should extend to overnight time and that this should occur at a graduated pace over 3 \u2013 6 months for a few nights a week, but remained of the opinion that a shared care arrangement was inappropriate for the children. section 61da parental responsibility the icl submits that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is rebutted in this matter and that sole parental responsibility should fall to the mother. in the family report of [dr g] at paragraph 37 he described the co-parenting relationship as \u201centirely sub optimal\u201d and that the communication between the parties is \u201csporadic, superficial and at times combative.\u201d the icl submits that the evidence of both parties given at trial spoke truth to [dr g]\u2019s observations in his report. while [dr g] in his report supported equal shared parental responsibility, his position changed when he gave oral evidence and no longer supported an order for equal shared parental responsibility. both parties made allegations of family violence in these proceedings, it is submitted that the evidence of either party will not allow the court to make definitive findings about this matter. the court is, however, likely to find is that the relationship between the parties was highly conflictual including in the presence of the children, that there was disharmony within the home, verbal aggression and denigration. neither parties\u2019 evidence would raise confidence that the co-parenting relationship would improve to such an extent that equal shared parental responsibility is appropriate. the positions of the parents in relation to [y] and his return from [country n] is the most glaring example of this. 60cc(2) primary considerations the children have a right to have a meaningful relationship with both parents. sadly, in this matter [y] is being denied the ability to have a meaningful relationship with his mother and his brother. the orders sought by the father do nothing to resolve this issue and if made would lead to a situation in which the relationship between [y] and his mother and brother will become irretrievable. [dr g] was clear in his report and evidence that if [y] remains in [country n] he will come to completely reject his mother and at paragraph 54 of his report states \u201cthis is not only a case where living arrangements are relevant, this is a matter of burgeoning alienation. [y], in my view, is in the process of being disaffected from his mother. were he to remain in [country n], there is a very real likelihood of him never returning to australia, or if he does, never having a meaningful relationship with his mother.\u201d interestingly, the orders sought by the father deny [y] from having a meaningful relationship with him also and it is of significant concern that the father does not see or recognise this issue. it is submitted that the court can have confidence in the mother facilitating a meaningful relationship between the children and the father, and the siblings with each other. [dr g] in his oral evidence was firm in his view that this is a case of alienation, being that [y] is being alienated from his mother. in both his report at paragraph 43 and in his oral evidence [dr g] raised significant concerns about how polarised [y]\u2019s views were in relation to his mother and father. at paragraph 43 [dr g] states: \u201cthe fact that he would find fault with everything that his mother has done is clinically remarkable. that [y] has been informed, presumably by his father or paternal grandmother, of certain actions taken by his mother, or her desire for him to return to australia, is damaging and manipulative.\u201d in his oral evidence [dr g] stated that if the court finds there has been alienation, than that is psychological abuse of a child. he stated that the outcomes for such children are \u201cnot favourable, they become very disturbed adults, have problematic relationships, can be alienated from own children, has lifelong consequences \u2013clinical markers are there for me. is it abusive \u2013 of course it is- are there lifelong consequences \u2013 that is well established. it is submitted that the orders sought by the mother and icl for [y] to be returned to australia and placed in the care of his mother are the only orders that will ameliorate the above risk. the court is likely to find that the risk of the children being exposed to ongoing family violence is reduced given the separation of the parties, this is likely to be further reduced by an order for sole parental responsibility. while [dr g] describes the father as under-resourced as a parent, it is submitted that the court will not have significant concerns as to his ability to meet the day to day needs of the children. 60cc(3) additional considerations the icl submits that no weight can be given to the views of the children given their young ages and developmental capacity to understand the long-term impacts of their views. further, the court would have significant concerns that the views expressed by [y] to [dr g] have been influenced. it is not in dispute that the mother is [x]\u2019s primary carer and attachment figure. nor would parties dispute that [y]\u2019s primary attachment would be to his paternal grandmother and that at present there are serious concerns in relation to [y]\u2019s relationship with his mother. in considering the nature of the relationship between the children and their father, the icl draws the courts attention to paragraph 52 of [dr g]\u2019s report and submits that this is an accurate description of the relationship. there was no evidence presented at the hearing that would have the court form a differing view. it is submitted that the court will find that the mother has taken every opportunity open to her to try to communicate, spend time with and make decisions for [y], but that this has been thwarted by the actions of the paternal family. the father appears to have delegated all parental responsibility for [y] including financial responsibility to his parents. there is no doubt that there will be a significant impact on the children with either parties\u2019 proposal. the mother\u2019s proposal will have a significant impact on [y] and [x] both emotionally and psychologically. it is submitted that the court will find that the mother is aware of these impacts and has already engaged with support services to assist her upon [y]\u2019s return. the impact of the father\u2019s proposal will also have significant impacts on the children, with the most obvious and significant impact being the end of any relationship between [y] and [x] and [y] and his mother. the consequences of this is clearly articulated in [dr g]\u2019s report and in the evidence he gave at trial. if the court was to allow [y] to remain in [country n], the practical difficulties in him spending time or communicating with his mother and [x] are clear. the icl submits that the court could not have any confidence that the father would comply with his proposed orders in relation to [y] coming to australia, in circumstances where the father has and continues to contravene orders of this court. in relation to [x], there are no obvious practical difficulties in the child spending time with or communicating with his father. the icl submits that the orders sought by her, or the ones sought by the mother are in the children\u2019s best interest and should be made. the icl submits that the spend time with arrangements proposed by her, are in line with [dr g]\u2019s recommendations and would allow the children to upon overnight time commencing to spend an uninterrupted weekend with their mother and allow the father to be involved in the children\u2019s schooling. in relation to [dr g]\u2019s recommendation that upon [y] returning to australia there be a moratorium on [y]\u2019s time with the paternal family including his father, it is broadly supported by the icl and while it is difficult to determine the length of time that it should be, the icl notes that [dr g] gave evidence that it is more likely months than weeks. written submissions in reply on behalf of the father so do i take it if that connection was to be- so, against his will, broken by him returning to australia now, rather than when he wants it to happen \u2013 that is, when he commences his secondary education, that could be pretty devastating for him. is that fair? --- that\u2019s entirely fair. further, the mother advances nothing that answers the very real concern that if the court orders [y] to return now and he does so but does not have the benefit of seeing his father with whom he has the strongest relationship (for an unknown length of time which is the mother\u2019s preferred orders) what that might mean for [y]. the mother and the icl ignore that very real risk to [y] and to [x] should the move happen now before [y] finishes primary school in [country n] and before his relationship with the mother and his brother has a chance to improve and develop. no concrete plan for therapy, counselling or other supports are in the mother\u2019s mind let alone part of a detailed roadmap that would give the court some modicum of confidence that a return now would work. what the court is therefore faced with is a possibility that [y]\u2019s relationship with his mother and brother will suffer if he does not return now versus the absolute certainty that his return will visit upon him harm that may well last a lifetime. the mother submits (at paragraph 11) that the father \u201cdid not consider [the relationship with [x]] important. his evidence was, in fact: i don\u2019t think it\u2019s hard to build a relationship between the brothers, but i still \u2013 i still believe for now, because [y] already half \u2013 halfway through his studies, it\u2019s better for him to finish and come back. [t21.11.22 p38] in respect to property, the submissions advanced by the mother (filed 29 may 2023) once again ignore realities in respect to facts and advance propositions at odds with settled law. for example, to disregard the loan agreement of 2011 because of \u201cfactors pointing away from it being considered valid\u201d would be an error. sums were being advanced as late as september 2022 and no demand had been made for repayment. not to consider the monies owed to the father\u2019s parents a liability to be reflected on the balance sheet and to just \u201cdisregard\u201d them ignores established law that liabilities are taken into account as an intrinsic part of the equation so as to determine the property of the parties. that is, the court must follow the well-recognised four-step process (see hickey & hickey & attorney-general for the commonwealth of australia (intervener) [2003] famca 395, (2003) flc 93-143) including identifying and valuing the assets and liabilities at the date of hearing for the purposes of division. to ignore the loan agreement and the evidence of the father concerning the loan (and the concession made by the mother about the sums of money being advanced to the parties throughout the relationship) would be to fall into error. if the court is against the father on that issue, an assessment of the parties\u2019 contributions must find the father\u2019s to be overwhelmingly superior to the mother\u2019s. her claim of $700,000 representing an entitlement of 35% of the mother\u2019s preferred asset pool must be considered an ambit claim. it is not supported by the evidence. in reality, there is nothing in the asset pool so as to allow such orders to be made. the court must deal with the reality \u2013 not what a party would like it to be. outline of principle: parenting ... maternity and paternity always have an impact upon the wishes and mobility of parents, obligations both legal and moral, the latter sometimes lasting a lifetime, restrictive of personal choice and movement having been incurred. ... it must not be assumed that one parent (the father) cannot move and that the mother must, in every case, subordinate her ambitions and wishes, not to the needs of the child, but to the wishes of the father to pursue his life in a place of his choosing. it is the interests of the child which are paramount, not the interests or needs of the parents, let alone the interests of one of them. 4] the problems that family law legislation deals with are human problems: with all their attendant variety and complexity. and at the end of a court proceeding under such legislation, a judge must make an order - usually an order that says yes or no to some application. \"[a] complicated mass of human experience has to be reduced to the simplest possible terms.\" because the problems are human problems, because they are as varied and complicated as they are, the legislature speaks in terms more often found in statements of aspiration than legal prescription. it is, then, hardly surprising that the guiding principles prescribed by the legislation for application in cases concerning the guardianship or custody of children or related issues, are principles that seldom, if ever, permit syllogistic reasoning. [205] further, when considering the reasons given by a judge who has made an order in an application about the guardianship or custody of children, it is necessary to bear steadily in mind that the judge must grapple with the chaotic complexity of real life, make predictions not only of what he or she concludes may happen in future but also of what will be \"best\" for the child, and do so having regard to what the parties have chosen to contest or emphasise in the course of the hearing. on the one hand, the appellate court is obliged to \u201cgive the judgment which in its opinion ought to have been given in the first instance.\u201d on the other, it must, of necessity, observe the \u201cnatural limitations\u201d that exist in the case of any appellate court proceeding wholly or substantially on the record. these limitations include the disadvantage that the appellate court has when compared with the trial judge in respect of the evaluation of witnesses' credibility and of the \u201cfeeling\u201d of a case which an appellate court, reading the transcript, cannot always fully share. furthermore, the appellate court does not typically get taken to, or read, all of the evidence taken at the trial. commonly, the trial judge therefore has advantages that derive from the obligation at trial to receive and consider the entirety of the evidence and the opportunity, normally over a longer interval, to reflect upon that evidence and to draw conclusions from it, viewed as a whole. the provisions in the family law act 1975 (the act) relating to children rest on twin pillars. the first is the importance to children of having a meaningful relationship with both parents, the second is the need to protect children from physical and psychological harm. these are stressed in s.60b(1) which sets out the objects of the legislation relating to children and are reiterated as the primary considerations in s.60cc(1). [4] when deciding what parenting orders to make it is the best interests of the children which are the paramount consideration. in determining where those best interests lie, the court must consider the primary and additional considerations set out in s.60cc. [5] there is a presumption that it is in a child\u2019s best interests for his or her parents to have equal shared parental responsibility for him or her (s.61da). the presumption relates to the allocation of parental responsibility, not the time a child spends with each parent. the presumption does not apply if there are reasonable grounds to believe that a parent has engaged in abuse of the child or family violence. the presumption may be rebutted if the court finds that it would not be in the best interests of the child for it to apply. [6] if the presumption applies, and there is an order for equal shared parental responsibility, the court must consider whether spending equal time with each parent would be in the child\u2019s best interests (s.65daa(1)) and, if no such order is made, consider whether spending substantial and significant time with each would be in the child\u2019s best interests (s.65daa(2)) ] the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) bill revised explanatory memorandum (2006) refers to the concept of a meaningful relationship on a number of occasions. at para 52 it noted that the primary factors mirror the first two objects set out in the new s 60b and that the objects are elevated to primary considerations as they deal with important rights of children and encourage a child-focused approach. the paragraph continues: the elevation of the object relating to the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both parents is consistent with the introduction of a presumption in favour of equal shared parental responsibility. ] here, the concept of a meaningful relationship is closely tied with the introduction of the presumption of equal shared responsibility, and the passage links the concept of a meaningful relationship with the objects of the division. the objects use the words \u201cmeaningful involvement\u201d. [22] at para 128, discussion of a meaningful relationship is again linked to discussion of the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility, the explanatory memorandum noting: the government considers that it is important to ensure that a child has a meaningful relationship with both parents and that both parents participate in decisions about the child. the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility is not a presumption of 50:50 joint custody. the presumption relates solely to the decision-making responsibilities of both parents. new section 65aa inserted by item 31 is the provision dealing with the time a child spends with each parent and the circumstances where the court should consider equal time arrangements. ] when considering s 65daa, the explanatory memorandum states (at [196]\u2013[199]): 6] subsection 65daa(2) recognises that an equal time arrangement will not be appropriate in some cases but that the court must consider other arrangements that promote a meaningful relationship. this provision places an obligation on the court in situations where there is equal shared parental responsibility and equal time is not appropriate, to consider whether it would be in the best interests of the child and reasonably practicable for the child to spend substantial and significant time with both parents. this is intended to ensure that in making parenting orders related to time that the court focuses not just on the substantial quantity of time that is spent with each parent, but also on the significant type of time. the note in this section emphasises that the best interests of the chid remain the paramount consideration for parenting orders. this is set out in s 60ca by item 9. ... [199] section 65daa (2) \u2014 (4) is intended to ensure that the courts consider arrangements that are much more than \u201c1 weekend a fortnight and half of the holidays\u201d or an 80:20 arrangement. it is intended to ensure a focus both on the amount of time and the type of time. it would include both day time contact and night time contact. it recognises that what is important is that the focus be on ways that both parents are able to develop a meaningful relationships with their children and share important events including everyday time with the child. it recognises that in order to have a meaningful relationship and to share equal shared responsibility that this would generally involve \u201cboth\u201d parents spending both substantial and significant time with their children. ] the new shorter oxford english dictionary on historical principles, clarendon press, oxford, 1993, defines \u201cmeaningful\u201d as \u201cfull of meaning or expression, significant, amenable to interpretation, having a recognisable function in a language or sign system, able to function as a term in such a system\u201d. \u201cmeaning\u201d is defined as \u201chaving intention or purpose, chiefly with a qualifying adverb (as well-meaning)\u201d. a second definition is \u201cconveying or expressing meaning or thought, expressive, meaningful, significant, suggestive\u201d. these definitions are repeated and further fleshed out in the oxford english dictionary, 2nd ed, clarendon press, oxford, 1989. it defines \u201cmeaning\u201d (in generalised use) as \u201csignificance\u201d. the examples provided take the matter no further. [25] the macquarie dictionary, 4th ed, macquarie university press, sydney, 2005, defines meaningful as \u201cfull of meaning, significant\u201d. within the definitions of meaning, the relevant one defines the word as \u201cexpressive or significant: a meaning look\u201d. [26] what these definitions convey is that \u201cmeaningful\u201d, when used in the context of \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d, is synonymous with \u201csignificant\u201d which, in turn, is generally used as a synonym for \u201cimportant\u201d or \u201cof consequence\u201d. i proceed on the basis that when considering the primary considerations and the application of the object and principles, a meaningful relationship or a meaningful involvement is one which is important, significant and valuable to the child. it is a qualitative adjective, not a strictly quantitive [sic] one. quantitive [sic] concepts may be addressed as part of the process of considering the consequences of the application of the presumption of equally shared parental responsibility and the requirement for time with children to be, where possible and in their best interests, substantial and significant. we also observe that in champness & hanson [2009] famcafc 96, (2009) flc 93-407 the full court (thackray, o\u2019ryan & benjamin jj) observed at [103]: the submissions of counsel for the father also appeared at times to be based on an assumption that it was obligatory for the trial judge to make the orders most likely to ensure the children had a \u201cmeaningful relationship\u201d with both parents. this is an incorrect assumption. the court\u2019s obligation is to make the orders most likely to promote the child\u2019s best interests. in seeking to achieve that objective, s 60cc(2)(a) directs the court to consider \u201cthe benefit to the child\u201d of having a meaningful relationship with both parents. even if such a benefit is established, it must still be weighed along with all of the other relevant factors. (see bennett j\u2019s analysis in g & c [2006] famca 994.) (emphasis in original) the full court also observed at [191]: \u201cthe first and very important observation we would make about this complaint is that the expression \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 is a legal construct, not a psychological one. it is for the court, not an expert, to determine what constitutes a \u2018meaningful relationship\u2019 \u201d. 7] for our part, we echo the view expressed by the trial judge of the serious nature of depriving the father of contact in circumstances where that appears to have been engineered by the mother, without any fault on the part of the father at all. this cannot be in a child's best interests. [178] it also does not appear to us to be appropriate for a parent to be able to manipulate the family law system to such an extent that the other parent's hope of ever seeing the child again, rests upon the possibility that she may wish to seek him out in later adolescence or adulthood. [179] we think that a family court would not be doing its duty if it were to simply give in to these sorts of considerations, except in the most extreme case and only then, when a positive determination is made that the welfare of the child requires it. given the overriding consideration of the welfare of the child, the court must consider the conduct of the parents, not with a view to rewarding one or punishing the other, but to ascertain from such conduct whether the welfare of the child will be better served in the custody of one or the other. consideration and disposition: parenting i agree with and accept the comments by dr g regarding each parent, notably the significant and multiple areas of deficiency of the father, and the mother\u2019s generally significant capacities as a parent who is in an intolerable situation as a result of the actions of the paternal grandparents, with whom the father is complicit in y remaining in country n and the growing

demonstrate that this has been done, no error is demonstrated by a failure to follow a particular order in doing so. further, the breadth and depth of the consideration of the s.79(2) issue, and the extent of an adequate exposition of it in the reasons, will vary from case to case. in that respect, the plurality in bevan said, at [82], that the separate s.79(2) issue will, \u201c...in many cases ... [be] ... effectively answered in the affirmative by the way the parties present their cases.\u201d [20] each of those conclusions conforms entirely with what was said about those issues by the high court in stanford v stanford (2012) 247 clr 108. [21] first, it is \u201c...not possible to chart [the] metes and bounds\u201d of the relevant discretion. just as importantly, it was recognised specifically that the characteristics of individual marriage unions, in so far as they acquire, hold and deal with property, differ. in \u201cmany cases\u201d, the union is underpinned by \u201c...stated and unstated assumptions between the parties to a marriage that the arrangement of property interests, whatever they are, is sufficient for the purposes of the husband and wife during the continuance of their marriage\u201d (stanford, at [41]). and, in \u201cmany cases\u201d, (but, not all) the \u201c...just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied...\u201d by the fact of separation: \u201c[i]t will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order ... because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and wife\u201d (stanford at [42]). \u201c...what is \u2018plainly wrong\u2019 will vary in the eyes of different beholders\u201d and also the fact that the \u201c...functions and purposes of the court ... [involve] ... difficult and evaluative decisions...\u201d such that \u201c...any two decision-makers may, with complete integrity and upon the same material, often come to differing conclusions\u201d. (cdj at [186(2)], per kirby j). ] ... as we have already said, there is no requirement to attribute different percentages to different periods in the relationship. indeed the full court has cautioned against it: see dickons & dickons [2012] famcafc 154, (2012) 50 fam lr 244, lovine & connor and anor [2012] famcafc 168, (2012) flc 93-515 and bolger & headon [2014] famcafc 27 where the full court said at [28], \u201c[d]oing so ... is not consistent with a holistic assessment of the parties\u2019 contributions which is what s.79(4) requires.\u201d it is only if error can be demonstrated in the overall result that the appeal would succeed. [168] ... the task is to consider the contributions holistically over the whole period from the commencement of cohabitation to trial and the analysis requires the court to weight all of the contributions of all types prescribed by s.79(4) made by both parties across the entirety of the relationship until the time of hearing, including the post-separation period. ] any and all such contributions, whether or not they sound in, or are directly linked to, the property available for distribution, should be considered and assessed together with the nature, form and extent of all other contributions of all types contemplated otherwise by s 79(4). [19] that is true of assets or income generated within the relationship and it is equally true of assets or income coming from outside of the relationship (for example, as here, in the form of inheritances). in the same way, s 79(4) specifically requires the court to take into account contributions made to the welfare of the family (and substantively and \u201c...not in any merely token way...\u201d, see, mallett v mallett [1984] hca 21, (1984) 156 clr 605 at 636 per wilson j) notwithstanding that those contributions may not be, or cannot be seen to be, directly linked to the available property at trial, or any increase or decrease in the value of the property. [20] put another way, consistent with authority, the s 79 discretion involves as a necessary requirement that \u201c... trial judges weigh and assess the contributions of all kinds and from all sources made by each of the parties throughout the period of their cohabitation and then translate such an assessment into a percentage of the overall property of the parties or provide for a transfer of property in specie in accordance with that assessment.\u201d (in the marriage of aleksovski [1996] famcafc 111, (1996) 20 fam lr 894 at 903). in aleksovski, kay j outlined the well-known \u201cgold bar\u201d analogy and said \u201c[w]hat is important is to somehow give a reasonable value to all of the elements that go to making up the entirety of the marriage relationship\u201d (at 83,443). [21] those same principles can be expressed as saying that the requirements of the section are met by approaching the assessment of contributions holistically and by analysing the nature, form, characteristics and origin of the property currently comprising that to which s 79 applies, and, in turn, analysing the nature, form and extent of the contributions (of all types) contemplated by s 79. that task is also undertaken by reference to the nature and form of the particular marriage partnership manifested by the particular circumstances of this particular marriage. is it, for example, a relationship, as deane j put it in mallett at 640-641 \u201c...where the parties have adopted the attitude that their marriage constituted a practical union of both lives and property...\u201d or is it, for example, a union where parties lived very separate domestic and financial lives? [22] the analysis just referred to might, obviously enough, also involve an examination of when contributions were made and the use made of contributions. but that is quite different to attributing to, or searching for, a necessary causal connection between contributions and the available property as a requirement for a particular contribution having significance in the overall assessment of what is just and equitable. ] we wish also to refer to the approach of the federal magistrate in attributing percentages to differing periods within the relationship, or types of contribution made. there is in our view little to be gained, and much to be said against, approaching the task of assessing contributions by attaching percentages to components of it. (the same, it might be said, applies to attributing a percentage to each of the relevant s 75(2) factors). [24] there can be little doubt that the classification of contributions by reference to terms such as \u201cinitial contributions\u201d, \u201ccontributions during the relationship\u201d, and \u201cpost-separation contributions\u201d, can be helpful as a convenient means of giving coherent expression to the evidence in a s 79 case and to giving coherence to the nature, form and extent of the parties\u2019 respective contributions. however, the task of assessing contributions is holistic and but part of a yet further holistic determination of what orders, if any, represent justice and equity in the particular circumstances of this particular relationship. so much is clear from the terms of s 79 itself and, in particular, s 79(2). the essential task is to assess the nature, form and extent of the contributions of all types made by each of the parties within the context of an analysis of their particular relationship. [25] doing so is also consistent with the demands of authority that the ultimate assessment of contributions should be made without \u201c...giving over-zealous attention to the ascertainment of the parties\u2019 contributions...\u201d (norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513 at 524) and the well-established recognition in the authorities (acknowledged specifically by her honour in this case) that the process required of the court by s 79 is the exercise of a wide discretion, not the performance of a mathematical or accounting exercise. [26] the necessarily imprecise \u201cwide discretion\u201d inherent in what is required by the section is made no more precise or coherent by attributing percentage figures to arbitrary time frames or categorisations of contributions within the relationship. indeed, we consider that doing so is contrary to the holistic analysis required by the section and, in the usual course of events, should be avoided. the consideration of the relevant matters referred to in s.75(2) of the act, pursuant to s.79(4), like the assessment of contributions, is holistic. also, like the assessment of contributions, it is not an accounting exercise. the reference to \"financial resources\" in the context of s.75(2)(b) has long been correctly interpreted by the family court to refer to \"a source of financial support which a party can reasonably expect will be available to him or her to supply a financial need or deficiency\". the requirement that the financial resource be that \"of\" a party no doubt implies that the source of financial support be one on which the party is capable of drawing. it must involve something more than an expectation of benevolence on the part of another. but it goes too far to suggest that the party must control the source of financial support... section 75(2)(o) plainly extends to any fact or circumstance which, in the opinion of the court, the justice of the case requires to be taken into account as showing that a party to the marriage is or is not able to pay spousal maintenance or is or is not able to support himself or herself. the paragraph has accordingly long been correctly interpreted by the family court as permitting consideration by a court of \"all of the financial matters which are relevant to [a] particular case\". nothing in the language or structure of s.75 prevents a fact or circumstance which falls within s.75(2)(o) being also a fact or circumstance which gives rise to a matter under another paragraph of s.75(2), including s.75(2)(b). consideration and disposition: property associate: dated: 19 october 2023 dated: 19 october 2023 [1] t 19 \u2013 22 [2] t 23 \u2013 28 [3] t 28 \u2013 30 [4] t 30 \u2013 34 [5] t 32 \u2013 35 [6] t 35 \u2013 37 [7] t 37 \u2013 39 [8] t 39 \u2013 40 [9] t 40 \u2013 42 [10] t 42 \u2013 43 [11] t 43 \u2013 46 [12] t 46 \u2013 49 [13] t 50 [14] t 50[15] t 52 \u2013 54 [16] t 54 [17] t 55 \u2013 56 [18] t 57 \u2013 59 [19] t 59 \u2013 62 [20] t 63 \u2013 67 [21] t 67 \u2013 70 [22] t 70 \u2013 76 [23] t 76 \u2013 80 [24] t 81[25] t 81 \u2013 84 [26] t 85[27] t 86 \u2013 87 [28] t 87 - 89[29] t 89 \u2013 90 [30] t 90 \u2013 93 [31] t 93 \u2013 94 [32] t 95[33] t 100 \u2013 104 [34] t 104 \u2013 105 [35] t 105 \u2013 106 [36] t 107 [37] t 107 \u2013 109 [38] t 109 \u2013 113 [39] t 113 \u2013 115 [40] t 115 \u2013 120 [41] t 120 - 127[42] t 127 \u2013 129 [43] simply for ease of reference, especially given the applicant\u2019s somewhat limited comprehension of english, i will not here revert to the usual description of parties as \u201chusband and wife\u201d, and will simply keep the references to \u201cfather and mother\u201d.[44] t 129 \u2013 132 [45] t 132 \u2013 136 [46] t 136 \u2013 142 [47] t 142 \u2013 144 [48] t 144 \u2013 147 [49] t 149 \u2013 153 [50] t 153 \u2013 158 [51] t 158 \u2013 161[52] t 161 \u2013 164 [53] t 165 \u2013 166 [54] t 167 \u2013 173 [55] t 173 \u2013 178 [56] t 178 \u2013 190 [57] t 190 \u2013 192 [58] t 193 \u2013 196 [59] t 197 \u2013 t 199[60] t 199 \u2013 208 [61] t 212 \u2013 215 [62] t 223 \u2013 227 [63] t 228 \u2013 231 [64] t 232[65] t 232[66] t 232 \u2013 234 [67] t 235[68] t 235 \u2013 236 [69] t 236[70] t 236 \u2013 237 [71] t 240[72] t 240 \u2013 242 [73] t 242 \u2013 243 [74] t 243 \u2013 244 [75] t 244 \u2013 245 [76] t 245 [77] t 246 \u2013 247 [78] t 247 \u2013 249 [79] t 249 \u2013 251 [80] t 251 \u2013 252 [81] t 252 \u2013 254 [82] t 254 \u2013 257 [83] t 258 \u2013 259 [84] t 259 \u2013 262 [85] t 263 \u2013 265 [86] t 265 \u2013 267 [87] t 268 \u2013 271 [88] t 271 \u2013 273 [89] t 273 \u2013 274 [90] t 274 \u2013 275 [91] t 275 \u2013 276 [92] 276 \u2013 279 [93] t 279 \u2013 281 [94] t 281 \u2013 283 [95] t 284 - 285[96] t 284 \u2013 286[97] t 286 \u2013 287 [98] t 287[99] t 287 \u2013 290 [100] t 290[101] t 290 [102] t 290 \u2013 291 [103] t 291[104] t 291 \u2013 292 [105] t 292[106] t 293[107] tb 3 \u2013 4 [108] tb 4[109] tb 4 \u2013 5 [110] tb 5 \u2013 6 [111] tb 6 \u2013 7 [112] tb 7 [113] tb 7 \u2013 8 [114] tb 8[115] tb 8[116] tb 8 \u2013 9 [117] tb 9 \u2013 10 [118] tb 10 \u2013 11 [119] tb 11 [120] tb 12 [121] tb 12 \u2013 14 [122] tb 14 \u2013 15 [123] tb 15 \u2013 17 [124] tb 17 \u2013 18 [125] tb 18 \u2013 20 [126] tb 20 \u2013 21 [127] u v u [2002] hca 36;

some paragraphs reordered. i will deal firstly with the welfare of the child x who is aged nearly 2 (\u2018the child\u2019). mr faheem (\u2018the father\u2019) is 35. ms habul (\u2018the mother\u2019) is 27. they commenced a relationship before they were married, but i am not sure whether they actually cohabited as man and wife prior to marriage. they were married in 2016 and then separated in march 2021. the father issued proceedings in may 2021. the mother joined issue with a response filed in july 2021 and sought spousal maintenance. 2 considerable time was taken to day whilst the court and the parties and their counsel listened to the recordings that form part and parcel of, as it turns out, the hand-up brief that the father was served with a week ago on 3 november 2021. the same transcript was tendered initially marked for identification (mfi) and now m1. 3 that transcript shows an angry and emotionally labile man. i do not speak arabic, and nor do counsel. in fact, the document should not be called a transcript. it should be called notes of a recording. certain passages are highlighted in yellow and it is those passages that will inform the criminal law proceedings that the father now faces and the settled reasons will recite the two charges that he faces. he was charged on 20 october 2021 but he was interviewed about that transcript on 15 august 2021. 4 the father was interviewed by the department of families, fairness and housing, which i will refer to as child protection, on 4 june 2021 and again on 18 june 2021. in regard to the issue of family violence, when first interviewed, the father responded that the couple would have normal couple arguments and the father denied ever yelling or raising his voice to the mother and denied ever abusing the mother physically, verbally or emotionally or controlling her life. he denied exposing the child to any of those arguments. 5 on 18 june 2021 he was interviewed again and he again denied that he ever yelled, raised his voice, threatened or controlled the mother. i am not aware of exactly when he first came to listen to those recordings, but i infer that he was aware of them on 18 june 2021. 6 the allegations of serious family violence against him are denied entirely by the father and he posits that he has been the victim of family violence himself and paragraphs 11 and 29-32 of his affidavit of 3 may 2021 state: 11. i was subjected to constant belittling and control by the respondent and her mother which exacerbated further upon the birth of x. ... 29. throughout the relationship, there have been numerous occasions where the respondent has been physically and verbally violent towards me and during these times where she has tried to twist the story of what is actually occurring during the argument. the respondent had a habit of creating issues and arguments and then trying to tum the story around to make it as if i was the party who was being abusive. 30. an example of this was during an argument we had in january this year where the respondent was being physically and verbally abusive. during this argument, the respondent ripped my shirt, scrapped my arm and pushed and shoved me. the police arrived that night took photographs and spoke to both of us and decided to take out an intervention order against the respondent to protect myself and x. 31. i eventually had the intervention order withdrawn as the respondent spent days begging me to have it removed and promised me and my parents that she would change and stop her erratic behaviour. 32. another example of the respondent's indirect family violence was when she came into the matrimonial home on 20 april 2021 where all of my belongings remained (after she had moved out and already taken all her items). the respondent removed all the furniture and household items including furniture and basic items that i needed such as the fridge, washing machine, all the kitchenware and every single item in the home besides my clothing. 33. i view this as family violence as the respondent did not require these items as she has them at the place she is residing, that is, her mother's home. it appears that the respondent acted in the way purely out of her controlling behaviour. she is aware that i required these items for my day-to-day living. 7 the circumstance that the mother attends the then rented home that he was living in, and effectively enters a home that was no longer where she was living, and removes all of the contents may well be family violence, or at least high-handed behaviour. he says that save for his clothes all of the contents of the home were removed. 8 the family violence that the mother alleges that she and the children have suffered is set out in considerable detail and has a compelling nature to its narrative in the affidavit of 6 october 2021. it is corroborated by the affidavit of her mother ms c. because of the pressing time i will not recite the allegations. but the allegations of family violence cover a considerable period of time and a considerable period of alleged violent activities, including sexual violence, physical violence, abuse and exposing the child to yelling and screaming and there is specific detail in regard to each of those matters. 9 the recordings and the tone recorded in those recordings with the occasional use of english in them also corroborate the mother's very serious allegations. the allegations include threat to kill or threat to cause serious harm, and they are corroborated by the police notes of a recording prepared by a leading detective senior constable and by this afternoon we became aware that not only is that person a police officer but is also an accredited interpreter. 10 the father objected to reliance upon those notes on the basis that they were not accepted as reliable. i read those notes and then ruled that they were admissible. the father's position then was that they should be given little weight. in the circumstances i am unable to give them little weight. i am compelled by the combination of the circumstances of having listened to the recording and the fact that the victorian police give them such weight that they found or assist the founding of serious charges against the father to give them considerable weight. 11 i place significant weight in terms of the weight to be given to the allegations against the father, on the fact that the father has been aware of the allegations or the fact of the recordings since june 2021 and was provided with the transcripts on the day before melbourne cup day and then was also sent the transcript very recently. 12 the father has chosen not to put his account or his version of what is said, particularly at the crucial parts of that transcript. he has chosen not to do that and the inference i draw is that he has chosen not to do that because, were he to do so, it would not assist his case, that is, the jones v dunkel [1959] hca 8 authority or the other authority blatch v archer [1774] engr 2, (1774) 1 cowp 63, 98 er 969 that the weight to be given to evidence relates to the power of a party to themselves give evidence and put it before the court. so that assists me give the notes of the transcript with all its imperfections that it may have some significant weight. 13 however, it is clear from listening to those notes of transcript that it is not an entirely accurate transcript, and nor does it purport to be. however, it is sufficient to demonstrate that there is substance to the mother's allegations. 14 on an interim hearing, i am attempting to follow paragraph 82 of goode & goode [2006] flc 93-286. on an interim hearing, save in exceptional circumstances, i cannot make findings of fact. the situation is, however, that all untested allegations are not of the same weight. i must give some weight to the mother's allegations. i cannot dismiss them in the circumstances of simply saying they are mere untested allegations. 15 the dispute between the parties comes down to whether there should be a continuation of the existing supervised regime or whether that should move to unsupervised time on the very limited basis as set out in the father's application. 16 on the father's case, the limited time that he seeks is eminently sensible. there is very significant, important evidence before me, and that is the two reports of d family services who supervised the father\u2019s time with the child. 17 the mother has filed a detailed affidavit where she sought to challenge or qualify certain observations of those reports. however, those qualifications that the mother asserts do not detract from the significance of the actual observations of the father and his daughter. the dynamics of the father and his daughter in the circumstances of her age and the fact that she had not seen her father for many months is very significant. the child is relaxed and enjoys her father's company. what is significant for me is that the many observations of the supervisor are then collated and put into a document where there is a summary given. the summary, of course, is by ms d. she did not make the observations. nonetheless, in this case it is convenient to refer to both summaries as they accurately reflect the many detailed observations of the report. 18 the reports cover 10 occasions of supervised time and demonstrate to me that the father deeply loves the child and is very attentive to her care and, at times when he is emotionally regulated, the child is not only of no harm in his care but would benefit from that relationship. 19 my concern, having listened to the recordings and considered the observations of his treating psychologist, is the potential for the father to become emotionally dysregulated. on the mother's case that dysregulation is the trigger for the behaviour of the threats to kill and threats to cause serious injury, if that is what he said. i do not find, and i cannot find on this hearing, that is what he said on the balance of probabilities. however, there is significant evidence corroborating that that is what he said as alleged by the mother and her mother. 20 that causes me to have concerns that at times of emotional dysregulation the father's behaviour may, not will, but may interfere with what is otherwise a lovely relationship between a father and a daughter. 21 the other aspect that i take into account is that on the mother's case, and it has substantial corroborating evidence, there is a real issue as to the mother's anxiety and concern about two things: (1) firstly, coming into contact at all with the father, including on changeovers, and (2) secondly, her concern about the father's ability to care for the child. firstly, coming into contact at all with the father, including on changeovers, and (2) secondly, her concern about the father's ability to care for the child. 22 i notice and place some weight on the circumstance that follow the release of the d report observations. the mother insightfully changed her position from no time at all, which was her position in her amended application once she changed solicitors and counsel as was announced to me on 8 october 2021, to seeking the continuation of that time. 23 that time is a considerable financial impost upon the father. however, it does bear repeating that that supervision demonstrates that the father is capable of caring very well for the child and that she, in all the circumstances, relates very well to him. i am satisfied that there is a real benefit to the child of having a relationship with her father. 24 the issue for me is in the circumstances of section 60cc(2a) of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u2018the act\u2019), that is, that i must give greater weight to the safety or protective primary consideration than the consideration i have just referred to. 25 in all the circumstances, i find it is in the child's best interest that the existing arrangements with the supervision continue. that is a significant financial impost upon the father and an impost on the mother's life. i note that it is to the credit of the parties the manner in which they were able to make arrangements to suit, or at least to minimise the inconvenience to all of them, to ensure that that time occurs on at least a weekly basis and it has occurred more frequently than that, and often twice weekly. 26 the benefit to the child of promoting that relationship with the father is significant, but i cannot find on this hearing that it is to the child's benefit that that move at this stage to unsupervised time. 27 i am concerned at the impact upon the mother at this stage when the father's psychiatric circumstances have a considerable question mark over them. the father's psychiatric or mental and psychological stability have question marks over them because of, firstly, the allegations that the mother makes and the behaviour that is described, secondly, the tone in the recordings, and, thirdly, the treating psychologist's report. 28 in regard to the treating psychologist's report, i agree with mr eley that that report is admissible pursuant to rule 7.01(1)(a)(i) and (iii) of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2001 as a report of a treater. i acknowledge mr hall's point that it is not on affidavit and that it does not demonstrate the instructions or the awareness of the primary obligation to the court. 29 nonetheless, i find the document to be admissible and in considering the father\u2019s psychological and psychiatric state, including whether or not there is an advantage or requirement that it be examined by (\u2018dr b\u2019), i place significant weight on it. so the existing time arrangements should continue: not move to unsupervised. 30 moving, then, to the other disputes between the parties. there should be an examination by dr b of the father at the father's expense. in the event that the father is able to fund an examination at a time proximate to his examination of the mother then that should occur. if he is unable to fund that report and i am unable to find that he can, then that will not occur. it is quite clear that the mother cannot fund that report. 31 the report of dr b should be undertaken with him being briefed with the section 67z response documents, both c1 and c2, and all of the material filed by the parties and the hand-up brief exhibit. 32 moving to orders sought numbers 7, 8, 9 and 10: that is, the undertaking of post-separation parenting course. the mother has not undertaken a post-separation parenting course. both parents should undertake a post-separation parenting course. that is not a criticism of either parent, but the reality is they will simply learn a significant amount, including about what the other parent is learning, by undertaking that course. 33 the watch list order should be made and i will make that for two years. it can be discharged later if appropriate. there should be an independent children\u2019s lawyer (\u2018icl\u2019) appointed on the basis of the allegations of child abuse, and that is allegations, not findings by exposure to family violence. that is the first category of re k [1997] famca 21. 34 i now come to the spousal maintenance issue. the law is that i only make a spousal maintenance order, if and only if, a party is unable to support themselves by any reason, including the care of the child. it is not disputed that the mother is unable to support herself because of her obligation to care for the child at this time. it is not suggested that the mother does not have an earning capacity. but that she cannot exercise it at the moment given her obligation to care for the child. 35 the real issue is whether the father currently has or should have an earning capacity such that would enable him to pay maintenance in addition to any child support. the significant document is those documents that relate to the father changing his employment from full-time to part-time. 36 the mother's case is that the father retains an earning capacity to the tune of $160,000 to $180,000 before tax and that, with necessary economies, with that income he could pay the $600 per week sought. indeed, that the mother's need is greater than that now that child support has been reduced. 37 the nub of that earning capacity turns on the paragraphs 73 of the father's affidavit and the exhibit to his affidavit of 29 october 2021 being the report of his psychologist of dr e (\u2018dr e\u2019). a relevant paragraph of that report is set out below: in my view mr faheem needs time off work to deal with tl1e stress and anxiety that the separation proceedings are causing him. he has explained that due to the nature of his work, mistakes are not tolerable. i have suggested he does reduced hours for the next few months with a view to review this periodically. much of his mental health will be influenced by the ongoing legal issues he is dealing with. from my dealings with mr faheem, i have no concerns about his ability to parent and nurture his daughter. if the court deems it appropriate, i can provide psychological and parenting capacity and child abuse potential testing for mr faheem. 38 because of the timing of the father's change of employment status from full-time to part-time, the mother's lawyers are very sceptical about the bona fides of that change. that scepticism can be readily understood. at the time the father appeared before me when an adjournment was sought to enable the father to respond to late filed material, he was in full-time employment with a base salary of about $130,000 plus super plus bonus, if any. 39 then, sometime in the week of 11 october 2021, he again consulted dr e who he had previously consulted in 2020. dr e's report is exhibit -3 and i have accepted that into evidence notwithstanding that it is not on affidavit. dr e's affidavit recites that in the doctor's view the father needs time off work to deal with the stress and anxiety that the separation proceedings are causing him. 40 as i have already recited, dr e's observations as to the psychological fragility of the father are corroborated by his lability in the recordings and the mother's allegations. i cannot dismiss that. the statement that the father is alleged to have made (in december 2020) and referred to by the mother's counsel is: if she wants to play the law, it is up her. i will play the law, too. 41 so then dealing with the spousal maintenance issue, it is not seriously disputed that absent full-time work the father does not have the capacity to pay periodic spousal maintenance. the expenses claimed by each party are not unreasonable. on the father's current income he simply does not have the capacity to pay spousal maintenance in addition to marginal rates of income tax, including medicare levy and child support as assessed. 42 i am unable to find that the change to part time work is a sham. i am unable to find that he has a capacity to pay spousal maintenance at this time. i have pondered that those bank shares that he owns, (we are not sure how far between 0 and 41 it is that would have a market value of roughly $4000), should be sold and applied to the mother as spousal maintenance. in the circumstances where i am compelling him to fund in the first instance dr b's report, i am not prepared to do so. 43 i will order that in the event that the father is unable to fund dr b's report, he is to sell those shares and he is not otherwise to dispose of them. he is also ordered to provide evidence within 14 days to the mother's solicitors of the status of those shares so it can be identified just which ones are his and which ones are not. so the application for periodic and retrospective lump sum maintenance is dismissed. 44 i am pondering the matters that mr hall sensibly raised about case management, that is whether the family report should be put off. the internal reports have a degree of flexibility. the interviews for the report may be undertaken before dr b's report is available and not necessarily. it would be greatly to the advantage of both parties, but particularly the father, if dr b's report was available to the parties before the family report writer is to interview the family for the purpose of the family report. however, that may not be. it is likely that the report writer would delay releasing the report until they had dr b's report. 45 i am also ruling that the matter should return to court on a further interim basis when i will have the assistance of the family report, dr b's report and an icl where the issue of whether the father's time should move to unsupervised should be considered. further, my associate has found a date for a further conciliation conference. i will give the parties another conciliation conference at public expense. it is 2 february 2022 at 9.00am. 46 my associates will find a suitable date for this matter to return in march, that is six months before the final hearing. given the child's age, i am determining that, as at this point in time and until there is further evidence before the court, that it is in the child's interest that the relationship with the father is pursued and is of benefit to her but supervised. however, from now until september is a very long time and it may not be in the child's interests that that should continue for that time. 47 i will also make an order that the father provide notice to the mother of any change of his employment status. 48 i will discharge the order for equal shared parental responsibility. that is not a criticism of the order that was made or in any way a finding that it should not have been made at the time that it was. however, in the circumstances that have arisen since, including serious criminal charges, it is not appropriate at this point in time that the parties have equal shared parental responsibility. 49 the other aspect that i did not deal with is that the father is anxious, i now understand, in the context of the mother being a baptised christian of the roman catholic stream or faith, that the child may be baptised. the mother has told me through her counsel and i accept that she has no immediate plan for such a ceremony and does not intend to carry out such a plan before final hearing, and certainly that would mean not before we return in march. 50 so i will simply note in the orders that the mother has no current intention to have the child undergo the ceremony of baptism and i will note that. she would be obligated to notify the father were that to change. but i accept that she is not going to do that and do not see the need to restrain her \u201cjust in case\u201d, in all the circumstances. 51 i do not intend to vary the ivo to make an order inconsistent with it to the extent of permitting publication on facebook. however, i will make an order inconsistent to the extent that the father is at liberty to provide by text message or email to trusted family or friends, photographs or videos of he and the child (but none of the mother) on the basis that they would not be published or distributed any further. 52 in other words, the modern equivalent of the father showing trusted friends or relatives what would once have been a pocketbook of favourite photos of the child and particularly in covid-19 times when it may be more difficult to actually share such happy photographs. he is going to be at liberty to do that via text message or email (but not facebook or social media) and these are my reasons why it is proper that an order inconsistent with the final intervention order be made.

[mr farrington]: no, sir. no. i think i will just get on and pull off the bandaid. as far as practice and procedure and these being so familiar, to lawyers they are. to me, they\u2019re not. his honour: no, no. i understand that. that\u2019s why i\u2019ve taken the large amount of time that i have just to go through it. [mr farrington]: and i appreciate that. at the end of the day, your honour, i\u2019ve lost confidence in you. everything aside, and understanding the way you\u2019ve read that affidavit, my understanding was that that affidavit would then lead into a hearing, as in, a proper hearing, ... [mr farrington]: so when you say something is a ruling and something is a comment but i\u2019m hearing it, to me it\u2019s almost the same thing. so when you say something like, \u201con the balance of probabilities, the mother did not assault [x]\u201d, when you say that, that is not me putting words in your mouth. that\u2019s you making a statement about something you have determined. ... his honour: but i have made no ruling on anyone\u2019s character. [mr farrington]: i understand that you haven\u2019t made a ruling, but i \u2013 but my contention is the way you act towards me and my case in almost every facet of everything you do gives me an apprehension that you are absolutely 100 per cent biased against me. ... his honour: so if i could just ask this: you know the focus is meant to be about me for a change. how does whatever the purported collusion between [mr h] and [ms bb]\u2013 how does that relate to me? was i involved in that or not? [mr farrington]: yes, you are. but for your leadership that wouldn\u2019t happen. leaders understand how and when to keep people that are under their control within, let\u2019s just say courtroom in this capacity. they understand how to do that and with an aplumb that tries and keeps things harmonious. his honour: so that\u2019s aplomb, right, not aplumb. [mr farrington]: sorry for my language, your honour. his honour: no, no, no, no. no. but \u2013 but much more seriously, i\u2019m \u2013 again, i\u2019m just trying to understand better, slightly channelling donald rumsfeld again. so if i don\u2019t know whatever this collusion is between [ms bb] and [mr h] that\u2019s said to be going on, how can i be responsible for that? [mr farrington]: because you have set the preconditions that the punishment that you would give them if they knew about it, is nothing that they would worry about. so that\u2019s the first part of that. and having read a lot of leadership manuals, it\u2019s part of it. however, the other half of leadership is followership. and neither of them have it, or had it for that activity that they did together on your behalf. his honour: so am i meant to be sort of like a policeman, to follow them up if i find out something? if i don\u2019t know anything about it, i am meant to follow up [mr h] and [ms bb] about what they did or didn\u2019t do? ... his honour: it\u2019s not something that i\u2019m responsible for, be that i know it, that i \u2013 that i don\u2019t know about. how can i be responsible for \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 [mr farrington]: your honour \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 that whatever the lawyers do or don\u2019t do that i\u2019m not aware of? [mr farrington]: your honour, you own your courtroom. everything that goes on inside or outside your courtroom to do with your cases is your responsibility. if they feel that they can get away with something, and that the punishment that you could possibly give them is either acceptable or that you won\u2019t, then they\u2019re going to do whatever they want. and that\u2019s what i found with the icl from day 1, and i\u2019m disappointed that [mr h] decided to join in with breaking one of your orders. i can\u2019t, you know, speak for him. i\u2019m sure he will speak for himself and make up an excuse. but \u2013 i withdraw that. your honour, it\u2019s for these reasons that i hold absolute apprehension that you have not only exhibited bias against me, but you continue to. and just in these conversations, although i do now understand some of your sarcasm, it\u2019s different to mine and it doesn\u2019t always come off like that. the amount of applications that i have made, either personally or through my legal team, that have been denied again and again and again, it is phenomenal. and that in itself is an indication that you are biased against me, which gives me apprehension. the father\u2019s supplementary submissions however, i will, argue that while judges are indeed permitted to form preliminary views, these should not unduly influence their final decision and should always be open to revision based on the evidence presented. in my case, i would argue that the judge has shown an unwavering commitment to their initial views regardless of new evidence or arguments, which could constitute actual bias. the obvious difficulty in response to paragraphs 4-6, i refer counsel to livesey v new south wales bar association [1983] hca 17, (1983) 151 clr 288. decision: the high court held that the apprehension of bias must be established based on cogent evidence and a reasonable suspicion, not on mere speculation or assertions. this case establishes the criteria for establishing bias. in the information provided by counsel, it is argued that i have failed to provide appropriate evidence to support my claim of apprehended bias. counsel further states that it appears that he (me) is dissatisfied with the interim decision of the court and has accused it of bias based on his own reasonable apprehension. i remind you of ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337 when the high court set out a two-stage test for determining whether there was an apprehension of bias. first, it must be identified what it is said that might lead a judge to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. second, it must be asked whether those circumstances would lead a fair-minded observer to reasonably apprehend that the judge did not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question he or she was required to decide. the complaints concerning misfeasance, res judicata, anshun estopppel, constitutional complaints, and complaints concerning the icl in response to counsel\u2019s paragraph 7(a), the constitutional matters i have raised are not nonsensical, but rather a legitimate concern that the court has overstepped its jurisdictional boundary and has not appropriately considered my rights under the constitution. while the family law act 1975 (cth) does indeed refer to state powers, it does not supersede or negate constitutional protections. it is important to remember that the australian constitution is the supreme law of australia and any law enacted by parliament, including the family law act 1975 (cth), must comply with it. in regard to counsel\u2019s paragraph 7(b) as to res judicata and anshun estoppel, while it is true of the caselaw used by counsel that these principles generally do not apply in parenting matters as per mcenearney & mcenearney [1980] famca 43, [1980] flc 90-866 and sps & pls [2008] famcafc 16, [2008] flc 93-363, my initiating application is absolutely meritorious given that my proceedings were commenced under the full weight of requirement of rice & asplund. moreover, even if these principles were to apply and my application was dismissed as a result, this does not necessarily mean that i have been treated fairly or that my concerns are unfounded. the court\u2019s refusal to consider my application could also be perceived as bias against me \u2013 a serious issue that requires careful consideration. lastly, while certain sections of the act may not directly apply to this case, their mention serves to highlight potential legal issues and complexities involved in family law disputes. they underscore my contention that my rights have been overlooked or disregarded in this process \u2013 an assertion that cannot simply be dismissed as \"unhelpful\". in regard to counsel\u2019s paragraph 7(c), my complaint about 'failure to respect article 18 of the iccpr' raises concerns about my treatment within court proceedings. the iccpr (international covenant on civil and political rights) affirms certain fundamental rights, including the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion. although it may seem far-fetched to relate this to an adversarial court process, i am arguing that i feel as though my rights have been infringed upon through what i perceive to be 'badgering and intimidation'. while it is accepted that strong questioning can occur in an adversarial system, there is a line between robust examination and bullying or badgering that creates an intimidating environment for a party. it could be argued that crossing this line infringes my ability to participate fully and fairly in proceedings - potentially impacting on my right to a fair trial. the assertion that i 'fail entirely to understand the legal process and the iccpr' may itself demonstrate bias by trivializing my concerns rather than addressing them substantively. the relevance of cases like ebner and johnson v johnson is they provide support for my argument that if there is reasonable suspicion of bias - actual or perceived - recusal may be appropriate. in response to counsel\u2019s 7(d) in this case, i argue that the trial judge has shown bias against me through their interactions with the independent children's lawyer (icl). i claim that there is a perception of unfairness or bias in how the court has allowed people to run their cases, and i allege a deliberate conspiracy between the icl and the mother's lawyers, [mr h] who both knowingly and deliberately broke a formal order of the court that they have both accused me of, even when i did not as follows: \u201c[ee organisation], not [dd organisation]. a rolling referral means that [x] has an open referral that can be used when the time is right. again, given your previous use of treating professionals, my client does not want another one to be tarnished. [x] has not been told about this, and i sincerely hope you do not speak to him about it. i also never said anyone had been engaged and confirm that no one has. i am concerned by your response, so please confirm that you do not intend to speak about this with [x]\u201d. the above conversation occurred between me, [mr h] and included the icl and [ms aa] from cyps. there was also an appointment already made with [ee organisation] for [x] to attend his next session. not only did i feel angry at being previously accused of booking medical/psychological appointments for the children without informing their mother which allowed the judge reprimand me for \u201canother contravention\u201d, both the lawyers involved guided the mother to ensure that a booking was made for [x] and then conspired to ensure that i did not find out about it. this made me feel completely helpless and powerless both as a father and in court as the judge either never believed the evidence i provided him, or it was never provided to him by the icl. no matter the reason, the icl and [mr h] seemed to feel so confident in the judge\u2019s obvious bias against me, they willfully, and without fear, orchestrated this entire deceit which emboldened the mother even further to act deceitfully. these above allegations can be considered under the first step of the ebner test, as they may be seen as factors that the judges decision-making as already been significantly influenced and remains open. if these allegations are proven, they could give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias in a fair-minded observer under the second step of the ebner test. i also contend that my complaints about the icl were ignored or dismissed by the court, both formally and as occurred, informally via return email when the judge refused me leave to file an application in a case against the actions of the icl and warned me for committing a \u201cpersonal attack\u201d on the icl instead. this made me feel unheard, ignored and not worthy of the court\u2019s support in a situation where the icl was not acting in the best interests of the children. this could also contribute to an apprehension of bias, as it suggests that my concerns were not taken seriously or adequately addressed by the court. the decision in ebner is relevant because it provides a framework for assessing whether there is an apprehension of bias in this case. applying this framework, if i can prove my allegations and show that these factors may have influenced the judge's decision-making, i may have grounds for seeking recusal due to apprehended bias. in johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, (2000) 201 clr 488, it was established that \"a judge is disqualified if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question\". i assert that both my experiences and perceptions throughout proceedings have given me reason to believe there is evidence of apprehended bias on behalf of judge. not only did i feel my complaints about the icl were dismissed without due consideration, but i have also experienced instances where i felt unfairly treated or targeted by judge. in light of these circumstances, applying johnson v johnson, it could be argued there are reasonable grounds for my perception of the impartiality of the judge. thus, should a fair-minded lay observer consider these same circumstances, they too might reasonably apprehend potential bias on part of judge. it is then pertinent in such circumstances, to request recusal on these grounds as per that established precedent from johnson v johnson. the \u2018request for judicial recusal\u2019 in regard to paragraph 8 & 9 of counsel\u2019s document, aside from ebner, and johnson, i draw your attention to reid v commercial club (albury) ltd citation: [2014] nswca 98 where the new south wales court of appeal held that an allegation of actual bias must be distinctly made and clearly proved, such a finding should not be made lightly, and cogent evidence is required. this case underlines that accusations of actual bias require strong proof. in this situation, it would need to be proven with clear evidence that the judge has been incapable of considering any arguments or evidence presented by me due to preconceived opinions. in light of these cases, it would be argued that my concerns are not simply personal grievances but are grounded in perceived actions by the court which could lead a fair-minded observer to question its impartiality. evidence will be presented showing how these perceived actions have affected the fairness and impartiality of the proceedings including through the use of the transcripts when delivering the reasons which would elicit such phrases from the judge as: \u201cdestructive hunger games\u201d or \u201ca game of wizard\u2019s chess where the aim is to destroy your opponent\u201d. not only did the judge aim these comments directly at me, he did so in circumstances of high pressure and high emotion but received the laughs from the bar table that i believe he was wanting. his comments made me feel punished, unheard and an object to be ridiculed by the judge and others in his court. furthermore, pursuant to livesey v new south wales bar association [1983] hca 17, (1983) 151 clr 288 it was established that even if there is no actual bias, if circumstances can give rise to a suspicion of bias, then justice requires disqualification. the standard is not proof of actual bias, but whether there appears a reasonable possibility of bias. i rely on this precedent to argue that despite the lack of clear evidence of actual bias, the circumstances surrounding my case can raise suspicions of bias sufficient for disqualification. i can and will highlight instances where i felt prejudiced and where i believe there was a lack of impartiality. relevant law in regard to counsel\u2019s paragraph 11 citing nadr v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs (2002) fca 361: in response to the counsel's argument, it is important to note that my application for judicial recusal does not hinge on an accusation of actual bias, which indeed is a grave and exceptional allegation as held in nadr v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs. instead, my application is based on the apprehension of bias which is a different legal standard. the test for apprehended bias as established in ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337 and requires us to consider whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. this test recognises that maintaining public confidence in the judiciary isn\u2019t merely about whether a judge is biased, but whether it might reasonably be thought that he or she is biased. my concerns relate to procedural irregularities and perceived unfairness in the proceedings, particularly relating to how evidence was considered and how parties were treated during proceedings. my concerns are not based on factual errors or faulty reasoning by the judge but on matters that may give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias. considering this, i argue that my complaints should be assessed against this standard of apprehended bias rather than actual bias. i assert that the way the court has conducted itself throughout these proceedings may cause a fair-minded observer to reasonably apprehend that there may be a lack of impartiality in its decision-making process. while i acknowledge the seriousness of allegations of actual bias as noted by justice emmett in nadr v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs, my application should be considered under the different legal standard of apprehended bias. my concerns relate more to issues of procedural fairness and impartiality from the perspective of a reasonable observer rather than allegations of actual bias on part of the judge. in regard to paragraph 12 where counsel cites reid v commercial club (albury) ltd citation: (2014) nswca 98. decision: the court held that for a claim of actual bias to be established, it must be distinctly made and clearly proved. it further held that the appellant had to show that the judge was so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, regardless of the evidence or arguments presented. the relevance to my case is because it sets out the principles for establishing actual bias, which is what i have witnessed of the judge in my case, however, there are key distinctions between this case and my situation which should be highlighted. unlike in reid, where the allegations of bias were not distinctly made and clearly proved, i have laid out specific instances and actions that indicate bias on the part of the judge. these include me alleging that the court has placed weight on certain unfounded allegations and made interim decisions without considering the validity of any of my arguments. the test in reid requires showing that the judge was committed to a conclusion incapable of alteration, regardless of evidence or argument. in my case, i allege that the judge has made decisions and expressed views demonstrating pre-judgement, indicating a commitment to a conclusion regardless of any of my submissions. reid also requires cogent evidence to establish actual bias. in this context, my assertions about procedural fairness breaches, perceived bullying by the court, reliance on non-evidentiary matters, and prejudicial narrative can all be seen as evidentiary support for my allegations of bias. therefore, while reid provides useful guidance on establishing actual bias, it is distinguishable from my situation based on these points and could potentially be used in support of my recusal application. in regard to paragraph 13 where counsel cites minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia legeng [2001] hca 17, 205 clr 507, 75 aljr 679, 178 alr 421: gleeson cj and gummow j observed that \"the question is not whether a decision-maker\u2019s mind is blank, it is whether it is open to persuasion\". this observation was made in the context of considering whether there was actual bias on the part of the decision maker. this principle suggests that a judge does not need to approach a case without any preconceived notions or opinions. rather, they must be willing to adjust these opinions in light of the evidence presented during the course of the trial. my complaints are about perceived bias, not actual bias. i argue that due process was not followed, that i was bullied by the court, that there were matters not in evidence which were considered, available evidence that was disregarded and that there exists a prejudicial narrative against me. these complaints suggest a perception that the court has already formed an opinion on my case and is not open to being persuaded otherwise by my arguments or evidence. this is different from arguing that the judge has actual bias against him. as an example: when i discovered that the mother had not declared her actual treating psychologist and reopened my closed case prior to a decision being made, i was made to feel as though i was some sort of \u2018thorn in the side\u2019 of the court. initially, the icl had refused to issue a subpoena until directed to by chambers. the icl undertook no due diligence to try and know the date that the mother commenced her treatment, and against my protests, issued a subpoena that had the potential to miss a lot of evidence. when i question the icl as to why she issued such a reckless subpoena, the icl simply told me that i could submit my own if i wanted to. i compiled what i though was a proper and diligent subpoena and submitted it to chambers with a covering letter seeking leave. the tersely worded email i received in response shocked me. my request for leave was denied and i was accused of personally attacking the icl. again, this made me feel unheard and irrelevant in my quest to receive all the available evidence and not just those parts that the judge wanted me to be satisfied with. the minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia legeng although referenced by counsel, can be distinguished from my case on the following grounds: in jia legeng, the issue was one of actual bias - where it was alleged that the decision-maker had a pre-determined outcome in mind and was not open to persuasion by any arguments or evidence. in contrast, my allegations pertain more to apprehended bias - where it seems as though the decision-maker appears (from my perspective) to have already made up their mind and isn't open to considering my arguments fairly. while gleeson cj and gummow j suggested in jia legeng that judges do not need to have blank minds but must be open to persuasion, i allege that this openness to persuasion is lacking in this case - leading to my perception of apprehended bias. therefore, while both cases involve allegations of bias, they are fundamentally different types of bias being alleged - with different standards and tests applied by australian courts when assessing these allegations. in light of this difference, my complaint should be evaluated based on its own merits and specific circumstances. with regard to counsel\u2019s paragraph 14, in my situation, i allege that the judge has displayed apprehended bias against me throughout my case. i continue to argue that the judge has formed an opinion about my character and conduct that is affecting their ability to adjudicate fairly on the matter. this can be correlated with point (a) of justice hayne's elements of actual bias. furthermore, i assert that this pre-formed opinion is influencing how evidence and arguments are being considered in my case. this aligns with point (b), where the decision-maker applies their opinion to the matter at hand. lastly, i believe that despite new evidence and arguments being presented, the judge remains steadfast in their prejudiced view against me, thus aligning with point (c) where it is stated that despite new evidence or arguments, a biased decision-maker would not give fresh consideration to these aspects. in consideration of those points, i offer the following: even though a pattern existed throughout our marriage, tendency evidence was not allowed, even after reopening my case with new evidence and the judge continually saying to me \u201cbut [mr farrington], you know this lady better than anyone else, you were married to her\u201d which was true yet the judge continued to disregard all examples of the mother\u2019s coercive behaviour and continues to do so. at one time during trial, while the mother was trying to contemplate an answer, the judge answered on her behalf. after new evidence was found it was ordered to be allowed into my case while still incomplete. the icl, who had been acting for over 2 years, was allowed to \u2018withdraw\u2019 by the judge 10 days from trial and nor in the best interests of the children. due to the need to subpoena the remaining evidence and find a new icl, i requested an adjournment that was denied. although i was provided 102na funding, there were no law firms available to assist at such short notice. i was denied access to uplift or copy the new evidence which restricted me to 2 hour blocks of taking notes and dictation. i was restricted, on order issued from chambers, from questioning anyone in the court room (instead of just the mother was had claimed dv) on the day of trial unless represented by counsel. the lack of consideration of probable maternal risk reflected through the recent orders effectively causing my children psychological harm. although i retained counsel on 11 august 2023, exchanged agreements, documents et al, the day before trial my son required my emergency assistance. as a result of looking after my son as best i could, i was unable to provide counsel with the required final brief paperwork at the assigned meeting time because i was with the police assisting my son. as such, counsel was required to leave 2 hours before i was physically able to meet with him and i lost counsel for the hearing. as such, no self-representative leniency or due process was provided. i wrote to chambers and explained what happened with my son and with my barrister and again, requested an adjournment which was refused. the response i received from out of chambers was not only condescending in its tone, but it was also completely dismissive as follows: \u201cwe note the father\u2019s comments both below and the application in a proceeding sought to be filed late yesterday afternoon seeking an adjournment of the matter in circumstances where the highly experienced icl is newly appointed and requires further time to properly consider the matter. nevertheless, the father himself has advised he is now attempting to brief counsel only the day prior to the hearing under the expectation that such counsel will be across the matter by tomorrow\u201d. these were unnecessary parallels to draw as one aspect related directly to my children and the other related directly to my ability to represent myself give that i had formally retained counsel on 11 august 2023. my complaints directly align with these principles from jia legeng's case, indicating that there may indeed be a case of actual bias present in my proceedings. the application for recusal is therefore justified as it aims to ensure a fair trial where all evidence and arguments are considered impartially without any preconceived notions or prejudices influencing judgements. moreover, it can be argued based on my allegations of misconduct by opposing parties not being addressed adequately by the court, that there is a reasonable apprehension of bias as per ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337. this principle does not require proof of actual bias but rather a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to bear upon the resolution of a question for determination \u2013 which according to my perspective, seems evident in this scenario. in regard to paragraph 15 of counsel\u2019s documents, i refer you to reid v commercial club (albury) ltd citation: [2014] nswca 98 where the court held that an allegation of actual bias must be distinctly made and clearly proved, such a finding should not be made lightly, and that cogent evidence is required. where the issue is actual bias in the form of pre-judgement, the appellant had to establish that the primary judge was so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or arguments may be presented. this case is relevant to my situation as it establishes the framework for assessing allegations of actual bias in judicial officers. despite opposing counsel's assertion that my complaints often fail at the third step identified by justice hayne in jia (i.e., the decision-maker disregarding evidence), there is compelling evidence in my case to suggest otherwise. in response to opposing counsel's argument, i would argue that while it's true that allegations of actual bias through prejudgments often fail at this third step, this doesn't mean they always do. in my case, i believe i have ample evidence to suggest that the judge did indeed disregard substantial and critical pieces of evidence in making their interim decision 04 august 2023. furthermore, i could argue that according to reid v commercial club (albury) ltd, an allegation of actual bias must be \"clearly proved\". while opposing counsel has attempted to dismiss my claims as baseless or self-serving, i maintain that i have provided clear proof of bias through my detailed documentation of the judge's actions and statements throughout the trial process. finally, reid v commercial club (albury) ltd sets a high standard for what constitutes bias - namely, a commitment to a conclusion so firm it cannot be altered by any further evidence or argument. i believe that in my case, this level of bias has been demonstrated by the judge's unwillingness to consider new evidence or perspectives once he had formed an initial opinion on the matter and even went to great length to ensure that new evidence was rendered \u2018useless\u2019. as an example, during the 03 august hearing where i was speaking about the actions of the mother in hiding her psychologist from the \u2018eyes of the court\u2019, the judge said words to the effect of: \u201cmaybe she had had enough of you and was just keeping it from you so that she could get some peace?\u201d. not only did this make me feel embarrassed, it affirmed my belief that no matter what i did or what evidence i presented, the judge was going to continue supporting the mother. in regard to paragraph 16 where counsel cites hartnett & sampson [2008] famca 75 the court held that the test for apprehended bias is whether a \"fair-minded observer\" would conclude that the judge had formed opinions which might affect his or her determination of outstanding matters. in this case i argue that the presiding judge has demonstrated bias in favour of the respondent and against me. i contend that a fair-minded observer, after reviewing the conduct of the trial and the interim decision, would reasonably conclude that the judge has formed opinions about my character and credibility which could unduly influence their determination of remaining matters. in response to opposing counsel's argument, it is important to note that while judges are expected to form preliminary views based on evidence presented during proceedings, it becomes problematic when these views appear to be formed without due consideration of all relevant evidence or in a manner that seems prejudiced. the principle as set out in hartnett & sampson [2008] famca 75 supports my position. the judge's apparent disregard for my arguments, combined with his decision to place significant weight on evidence from care and protection services without thoroughly examining its veracity against what i have exposed as \u2018interference by the icl\u2019, suggests an opinion formation process that is not entirely impartial, therefore, i maintain our stance for recusal based on apprehended bias. with regard to paragraph 17 where opposing counsel cites isbester v knox city council citation: (2015) 255 clr. decision: the high court of australia found that there was apprehended bias in the decision-making process of the council and quashed the council's decision. relevance: this case is relevant as it provides a clear explanation of the test for apprehended bias in australian law. it emphasizes that the hypothetical fair-minded observer should be aware of the nature and context of the decision and should have knowledge about the circumstances leading to the decision. although i am not a lawyer, i am not uninformed about the law or the issue at hand. i am aware that adjudicators are under professional pressures to uphold integrity and impartiality, and they are neither complacent nor overly sensitive in doing so. i also refer you to johnson v johnson citation: (2000) clr 488. decision: the high court held that judges do not need to be entirely passive or silent during proceedings. they can ask questions and make comments without causing a reasonable apprehension of bias. this case is relevant because it clarifies that judges can actively participate in court proceedings without giving rise to an apprehension of bias. in my case, any active involvement by the judge does not necessarily lead to a reasonable apprehension of bias. the judge's actions should be viewed through the eyes of a fair-minded lay observer who understands that judges may properly adopt reasonable efforts to confine proceedings within appropriate limits and to ensure time is not wasted. in response to opposing counsel's argument, while it's true that a fair-minded lay observer would have some general knowledge about how legal proceedings work, this does not mean they would automatically discount any potential indications of bias on part of the judge. if there are clear instances where the judge has shown partiality or has failed to give fair consideration to all evidence and arguments presented, then this could potentially lead this hypothetical observer to question their impartiality, justifying a recusal application. it's important to note that even if my application was unsuccessful, this does not necessarily indicate that my claims were baseless or that i was merely dissatisfied with an unfavorable ruling - rather, i may have had legitimate concerns about perceived bias which i felt needed addressing for fairness in his trial. both the above two cases emphasize the importance of judges maintaining impartiality and fairness throughout legal proceedings - and while judges are allowed some level of active participation in court proceedings, this must not cross into apparent partiality or prejudgment. in regard to paragraph 18 where opposing counsel cites r v watson [1976] hca 39, (1976) 136 clr 248 the high court of australia held that a judge should not preside over a case if there is any reasonable suspicion from the parties or the public that he/she may not be impartial or unbiased. in such circumstances, prohibition will apply. this is crucial to maintaining public confidence in the justice system. if there is any reasonable apprehension or suspicion that the tribunal has already pre-judged the case, then confidence in its decision cannot be maintained. this case is relevant to my application for recusal as it sets out the principle that a judge should not preside over a case if there is any reasonable suspicion of bias or prejudice. here, i have alleged bias by the judge, claiming that the judge has failed to follow due process and has allegedly bullied me. i also claim that there is a prejudicial narrative against me while making an interim determination. in response to opposing counsel's arguments, i will argue based on r v watson that my allegations of bias, if found to be reasonably suspected by a fair-minded observer, could warrant recusal of the judge. it is crucial for maintaining public confidence in the administration of justice that all parties have faith in the impartiality and fairness of their judicial officers. in regard to paragraph 19 where opposing counsel cites ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy citation: [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337, the high court held that the test for apprehended bias is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. the high court also stated that if there is real doubt, it would be prudent for a judge to decide whether or not to sit to avoid inconvenience if an appellate court were to take a different view. in my case, i argue that there is indeed a \"real doubt\" about the impartiality of the judge due to multiple instances of perceived unfair treatment and alleged bias against me. i believe this case is relevant because it provides a basis for my argument that the judge should consider recusing himself from this case due to these concerns. my argument is not merely based on my dissatisfaction with the interim decision but rather on specific instances of perceived unfairness and bias in these proceedings. this includes allegations of bullying, failure to respect due process, prejudicial narrative, and considering matters not in evidence. i assert these issues go beyond mere dissatisfaction with an interim decision, they speak directly to whether or not a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question he or she is required to decide as per ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy. therefore, i believe that this case supports my application for recusal as it emphasizes both the importance of perceived impartiality in maintaining public confidence in judicial processes and suggests prudence in cases where there's real doubt about a judge's ability to remain impartial. with regard to paragraphs 20-23 where opposing counsel cites anae v r citation: [2018] nswcca 73, in this case, the court found that there was indeed apprehended bias on the part of the trial judge. this conclusion was reached by applying a four-step process which involved considering if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. this case is relevant to my situation because it outlines the test for apprehended bias. according to this test, if a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question at hand, then there may be grounds for recusal. if i can demonstrate a connection between events that give rise to an apprehension of bias and a possibility of departure from impartial decision-making in my case, then it may support my application for recusal. furthermore, where counsel cites huda & huda & laham citation: [2018] famcafc 85, in this case, while no apprehended bias was found by the full court of the family court, procedural unfairness was determined based on the trial judge\u2019s interventions, including their number, length and circumstances. this case is relevant as it demonstrates that even if bias isn't found, other factors such as procedural unfairness can impact a judgement. in my case, i can demonstrate similar irregularities or undue interventions by the judge, strengthening my argument for recusal even in absence of demonstrable bias. however, it should be noted that simply demonstrating procedural unfairness would not necessarily lead to a successful recusal application, rather, it could lead to an appeal on those grounds. with regard to paragraph 24 where opposing counsel cites newett, i firstly refer you to minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia legeng (2001) 205 clr 507. this case provides a definition of actual bias, stating that it requires a demonstration that the primary judge was \"so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or arguments may be presented.\" this decision is relevant to my application because it sets out the standard i need to meet in order to show actual bias on the part of the judge. in response to opposing counsel's argument, it can be argued that this standard has been met in my case. the fact that the judge has made an interim decision without considering all my available evidence or hearing my full arguments could indicate that they the judge is committed to a conclusion that cannot be altered by any further evidence or arguments i might present. further with reid v commercial club (albury) ltd [2014] nswca 98 it was held that allegations of actual bias require cogent evidence and should not be made lightly. this decision is relevant as it emphasizes the seriousness of an allegation of bias and the high standard of proof required. however, in response to opposing counsel's argument using this case, i argue that i have provided cogent evidence of bias, including examples of the judge making decisions without considering all available evidence, ignoring certain arguments put forward by me, and making an interim decision against me without giving me a fair opportunity to present my case. finally with the case of newett & newett (no. 6) [2022] fedcfamc1a 70 this case provides a summary of what constitutes actual bias and emphasizes that such a finding requires cogent evidence and should not be made lightly. in response to opposing counsel's use of this case, i argue that i have provided sufficient evidence of actual bias on the part of the judge, including specific instances where the judge disregarded my evidence or arguments and made decisions without giving me a fair opportunity to present my case. overall, while these cases set a high bar for proving actual bias on the part of a judge, i can argue that i have met this standard based on my specific allegations and evidence. with regard to counsel\u2019s paragraphs 25 & 26, in charisteas & charisteas citation: [2021] hca 29, (2021) 273 clr 289, the high court reiterated the principles of apprehended bias, stating that a judge is not expected to remain passive or 'sphinx-like' during proceedings. they are permitted to express tentative or preliminary views without this being seen as prejudgment. this case is relevant because it directly addresses one of my main complaints \u2013 that the judge has shown bias in expressing views and making decisions throughout the proceedings. the opposing counsel references this case to argue that the judge's actions fall within acceptable conduct as outlined by the high court. however, i will, argue that while judges are indeed permitted to form preliminary views, these should not unduly influence their final decision and should always be open to revision based on the evidence presented. in my case, i would argue that the judge has shown an unwavering commitment to their initial views regardless of new evidence or arguments, which could constitute actual bias. again, i refer you to johnson v johnson citation: [2000] hca 48, (2000) 201 clr 488, where the court held that a fair-minded observer must reasonably apprehend that a judge might not bring an impartial mind to resolve questions they are required to decide for a successful claim of apprehended bias. this case provides the test for apprehended bias. in my response, i would argue that based on my experiences and observations during the proceedings, a fair-minded observer could reasonably conclude that the judge might not bring an impartial mind in deciding this case. then looking at galea v galea citation: (1990) 19 nswlr 263 at 278-279, the court affirmed the principle of judicial impartiality and added context about judges expressing preliminary views. this case supports my argument in my case by providing additional context on judicial conduct regarding expressing views during proceedings. i can use this case to argue that while judges can express preliminary opinions, those opinions should not impede their ability to make impartial judgments based on all presented evidence. as an example, during the mother\u2019s cross-examination, she was asked a question about the children dealing with losing contact with their father and, before the mother could answer, the judge said \u201ci am sure you would get some grief counselling for them wouldn\u2019t you [ms belkis]. this made me feel completely overshadowed and abandoned with no hope of any sort of fairness. finally, garrett & freeman (no 3) [2007] nswlec 139 reiterated principles around judicial conduct and expressions of preliminary views during proceedings. similar to galea v galea, this case provides further support for my argument surrounding judicial conduct and potential bias. i can use it to highlight instances where i believe the judge's expressed views have crossed into prejudgment territory. with regard to paragraph 27 where opposing counsel cites vfab v the minister for immigration and indigenous affairs citation: [2003] fca 872, (2003) 131 fcr 102, in this case, the court held that occasional displays of impatience and irritation by a judge will not amount to a disqualifying bias. momentary outbursts and misunderstandings in the often-stressful work of adjudication must be tolerated, so long as they pass and do not affect the functions of the adjudicator. the relevance of this case to my situation is that it provides clarification on what constitutes judicial bias. according to this precedent, occasional displays of impatience or irritation from a judge do not necessarily equate to bias. however, my allegations go beyond occasional displays of impatience or irritation. i allege consistent prejudicial behaviour and decisions against me that i believe demonstrate a lack of impartiality. furthermore, my allegations are not related to momentary outbursts or misunderstandings but concern persistent patterns of behaviour and decision-making that i believe show an unfair bias against me. as an example: when i was speaking to the court about the new psychological evidence of the mother, other than [mr n], no one else had read through it. as such, the judge was uninterested and impatient while i was trying to convey the importance of what i had found. in a final act to try and placate me more than a desire to openly listen, the judge told me that i \u201chad 2 minutes summarize why the new documents were misleading\u201d. i had tried to summarize my notes as succinctly and quickly as possible and i was then cutoff. the judge then asked [mr n] if he might have another look at the files, particularly the page that i had quoted, to see if i was accurate and provided no time limitation. later that evening [mr n] was able to \u2018copy and paste\u2019 the section i was trying to summarize that was not only longer and more in depth, it read somewhat differently from the way i had read it out in court in my allocated time. consequently, the following day, the judge accused me on contempt of court which was not only unfair, it was highly demoralizing and inappropriate. therefore, while vfab v the minister for immigration and indigenous affairs provides important context about what constitutes judicial bias, it may not fully apply to my situation given the nature and extent of my allegations. the key distinction lies in the persistence and pattern of alleged bias in my case versus the \"momentary outbursts and misunderstandings\" referred to in vfab v the minister for immigration and indigenous affairs. as such, while i acknowledge the ruling in vfab v the minister for immigration and indigenous affairs, i maintain that my allegations warrant serious consideration due to their ongoing nature and potential impact on my case's fair adjudication. with regard to paragraph 28 where opposing counsel cites antoun v r citation: [2006] hca 2, (2006) 224 alr 51, the court maintained that judicial officers have the authority to warn parties of the likely outcome if they pursue a certain course of action. this includes expressing robust terms to parties and their lawyers about submissions or actions that are deemed hopeless, a waste of time, or destined to fail. in the context of my case, opposing counsel is using this precedent to justify the judge's conduct and argumentation in dealing with my application for recusal. he argues that what i perceive as bullying or bias is simply the court performing its duty in managing proceedings and guiding litigants. however, i would argue that there is a significant difference between providing guidance and prematurely forming an opinion about a party's case. while antoun v r supports judicial intervention for guiding proceedings, it does not validate forming prejudiced views or displaying partiality, which is what i allege. furthermore, it is worth noting that although robust exchanges can occur in courtrooms without constituting bias, such exchanges should not result in a party feeling unduly targeted or disadvantaged \u2013 as has been my experience in this case. finally, i must consider whether the judge\u2019s comments have crossed the line from \u2018candid judicial speech\u2019 into creating an apprehension of bias. this distinction is crucial and forms the basis of my application for recusal \u2013 which alleges not merely robust judicial management but partiality and bias against him. the task of the father in regard to paragraphs 27-29 (noting that the previous section ended in paragraph 28 with the sloppy copy paste approach of opposing counsel) i direct you to re jrl, ex parte cjl [1986] hca 39, (1986) 161 clr 342. this case provides the basis for the apprehension of bias test in australian law. the high court held that a judge should not sit to hear a case if a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. the ruling in this case is relevant because it establishes the test for apprehended bias, which i have alleged. like in ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337, this high court case held that whether there is an apprehension of bias should be determined by considering what a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend in all the circumstances of the case. this decision is relevant as it further clarifies the test for apprehended bias and how it should be applied. as per johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, (2000) 201 clr 488, the high court reiterated that a judge must not only be impartial but also appear to be impartial, and that allegations of bias must be established on strong evidence. however, they also recognised that judges have some leeway to express their opinions during proceedings without giving rise to an apprehension of bias. this decision could be used by me to argue that while judges may express opinions, my perception of bias was reasonable due to particular conduct or comments by the judge. in response to opposing counsel's argument about failing to provide transcripts, transcripts are not essential to establish bias at the application stage. i would argue that bias can be established at any stage and through other means such as affidavits outlining specific incidents or comments made by the judge which gave rise to an apprehension of bias. i would also argue that my perceptions and feelings are valid considerations in determining whether there was an apprehension of bias. regarding opposing counsel's assertion that the test concerning apprehended bias similarly fails, i would contend using precedents like re jrl, ex parte cjl, ebner v official trustee and johnson v johnson as my allegations do meet the necessary threshold. i have experienced instances where i believe there was a lack of impartiality by the judge, and these instances should be given due consideration when applying the test for apprehended bias. the actual complaints with regard to paragraphs 30-31 in response to the opposing counsel's argument of my complaints: as to due process and procedural fairness not being followed, counsel mischaracterizes my position. i have not objected to the procedural steps taken by the court but rather to the fairness and impartiality of its application. this is a legitimate concern and reflects our system's fundamental commitment to justice which is clearly established in the case of r v watson, ex parte armstrong [1976] hca 39, (1976) 136 clr 248. on allegations of bullying, it is not for the opposing counsel to determine whether these allegations are supportable or not. the test for bias, as laid out in johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, is whether a fair-minded observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the case. in relation to complaints about matters not in evidence and which were inadmissible, it is incorrect that such matters cannot form part of a recusal application. the court has wide powers to admit evidence that would otherwise be inadmissible if it is relevant to determining whether there is a reasonable apprehension of bias as per rogers v the queen [1994] hca 42. concerning a 'prejudicial narrative', this refers to my contention that certain assumptions or conclusions appear to have been made by the court without proper evidentiary basis. while courts must indeed make determinations based on evidence presented, where there appears to be a predetermination or prejudgment, this can give rise to an apprehension of bias, as was found in ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63. as for an interim determination being made against my favour, this alone does not establish bias but depending on how that decision was arrived at could potentially contribute towards an apprehension of bias if it appears that the decision was made prematurely or without proper consideration of all relevant factors (minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia legeng [2001] hca 17). thus, contrary to opposing counsel\u2019s argument, my complaints do not fail but rather, raise serious concerns about procedural fairness and impartiality that warrant careful consideration by this court. with regard to paragraph 32 opposing counsel has raised several points concerning due process which i will address as follows: while it is true that i was permitted to make applications during the proceedings, the fact that they were repetitively unsuccessful does not equate to me being offered due process. to ensure fairness and justice, it's important to consider that each application should be assessed on its own merits rather than being prejudiced by previous unsuccessful attempts. opposing counsel has critiqued my focus on his own view of due process, however, this is a crucial aspect in any legal proceeding. my perceived view of due process might differ from that of a legal professional, but it does not mean it is less valid or relevant. furthermore, the label of an 'experienced litigant' can imply an unfair bias against me in court proceedings. the fact that i have made numerous applications and received several (3, not 10) cost orders against me does not indicate apprehended bias on my part, but rather an unyielding determination to seek justice and fairness in my case. my understanding of equity should not be dismissed as wrongheaded but should be considered within the context of my experiences within these proceedings. my complaints about lack of punishment for others' perceived wrongdoing are valid concerns in ensuring a fair trial. as an example, if the icl can lie to the court and then i provide the court with the evidence and then the court says and does nothing to the icl on their own merits, is that equity or is it \u2018one rule for some and another rule for others\u2019? opposing counsel's assertion about my 'willful lack of knowledge' is unfounded and assumes intent on his part to remain ignorant about legal procedures and roles within the court system, which is prejudicial. whether findings have been made or not, it is important for a fair-minded lay observer to consider all aspects of the case without bias or prejudice - including the potential impact on my feelings and personal experiences. as for the alleged admission of an affidavit that was not admitted - this matter should be clarified by reviewing court records and transcripts rather than dismissing it as untrue based solely on opposing counsel's claim. this analysis can be supported by the case law \"johnson v johnson (2000) clr 488\" where justice kirby noted that a reasonable member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious but would need to have sought to be informed on at least the most basic considerations relevant to arriving at a conclusion founded on a fair understanding of all the relevant circumstances. with regard to counsel\u2019s paragraph 33, i refer you to johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, (2000) 201 clr 488 citation: [2000] hca 48, where the high court held that the concept of 'bias' must be considered from the perspective of a reasonable observer who is informed and fair-minded, and not unduly sensitive or suspicious. it was further noted that judges are expected to bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the questions they are required to decide, but they are not required to have no prior thoughts on the subject matter. relevantly, my case provides a framework for understanding 'bias' from a legal perspective. the opposing counsel's argument that my allegations of bullying are \"not supportable\" could be challenged by this perspective. if can demonstrate that a reasonable observer might perceive bias in the judge's conduct, i may have grounds for recusal. in reid v commercial club (albury) ltd [2014] nswca 98 citation: [2014] nswca 98, the nsw court of appeal held that allegations of actual bias require clear proof and should not be made lightly. it was held that the appellant had to prove that the primary judge was so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, regardless of any evidence or arguments presented. this case reiterates the high standard required to establish actual bias in judicial proceedings. in response to opposing counsel's arguments, i argue that my complaints represent my attempt to meet this high standard rather than baseless attacks on anyone who disagrees with me. as in ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337, the high court held that an allegation of apprehended bias should be upheld if a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to bear on the resolution of a question he or she is required to decide. this case provides guidance on what constitutes apprehended bias from a legal standpoint. using this case, i argue that his perception of being bullied by the court could lead a reasonable observer to believe there is potential for bias against me in these proceedings. i will provide clear evidence supporting my claims of bullying and perceived bias, demonstrating how these instances have affected the impartiality of the court proceedings and my grounds for recusal based on these cases. regarding paragraph 34, opposing counsel is drawn to the attention of briginshaw v briginshaw [1938] hca 34, [1938] 60 clr 336, where the high court of australia held that in civil litigation, the standard of proof is a balance of probabilities. however, this does not mean that all matters are to be proved on a simple balance of probabilities. the gravity of the allegations made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the seriousness of the consequences flowing from a particular finding, are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether an issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of a tribunal. this case is relevant to my situation as it establishes that even in civil proceedings such as family law cases, where serious allegations such as bias are made, those allegations must be proven to a higher standard than merely on balance of probabilities. in response to opposing counsel's argument concerning matters not in evidence: whilst it is true that i have referred to submissions and statements that were not formally put into evidence, i did so in an attempt to illustrate patterns of behavior and systemic issues that i believe have contributed to perceived bias in his case. in doing so, i was exercising his right to put forward all relevant material for consideration by the court. as an example: counsel renders himself hypocritical as neither he nor the icl adhered to their case outlies and not adhere to only that evidence already placed as part of their tender bundles. although i understand the discretion allowed by the judge to consider all manner of evidence, this tactic led to evidence that was being used against me, never being put to me before with proper warning and due process. instead, it was used as a \u2018trick\u2019 to try and throw me. when i provided proper answers, i was mocked by the parties and the judge, none of whom had been to war or served overseas yet felt that my explanation was so far-fetched, it deserved ridicule. as for the \"secret person\" allegation, it may seem unusual but should not be dismissed outright. if there is indeed someone who can provide significant insight into potential bias in this case, their testimony could be crucial. it is important for all parties involved to maintain an open mind and respect due process. after 30 years in the [defence forces] and the conduct of 100s of formal investigations, i have no ability to merely \u2018brush away\u2019 important evidence or information anytime it suits me. overall, these arguments of counsel do not make my application untenable, rather they highlight the complexity and high stakes nature of this matter which warrant careful consideration by this court. in regard to paragraph 35, in response to the opposing counsel's argument concerning the 'prejudicial narrative' complaint, it is important to clarify my position and provide relevant case law as follows: when i refer to a \u2018prejudicial narrative\u2019, i am expressing my concern that the court has formed a negative view of me based on unreliable or unsupported allegations. this might potentially affect the impartiality of its decision-making process. the concept of prejudicial narrative in this context can be understood as an overarching bias or prejudice against me that may influence the court's perception and judgment of the case. i believe that the court should interrogate both sides of the case evenly. it is not a matter of delaying decisions but ensuring that they are made with due regard to all evidence and perspectives presented, including my own. i do not argue that my alleged deficiencies in empathy or insight and non-physical or financial acts of family violence should not be accounted for and learned from. rather, i argue that these allegations have been overstated or misinterpreted, creating a prejudicial narrative against me in order to induce a desired outcome. concerning apprehended bias, while authorities make it clear that a judge is not to remain \u2018sphinx-like\u2019, it is equally essential that they do not form conclusions prematurely without considering all facts and arguments (ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337). the fear here is not about the judge's engagement, but about possible premature conclusions drawn which could potentially lead to bias. in this context, johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, 201 clr 488, 174 alr 655, 74 aljr 1380, might be a relevant case where gleeson cj at [11] stated \"bias is an attitude of mind which prevents an impartial adjudication upon issues\". in my case, so bad is the bias attitude that not even my children will be listened to or their older half-sister that has lived through this exact same treatment from the mother before. the result now: [ms m] refuses to have any form of contact with her mother. furthermore, in livesey v new south wales bar association [1983] hca 17, (1983) 151 clr 288, mason and brennan jj stated: \"the apprehension of bias principle admits of the possibility of human frailty... its application is as diverse as human frailty. its application requires two steps: first, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead a judge (or juror) to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits, secondly, there must be an articulation of the logical connection between that matter and feared deviation from deciding on its legal and factual merits.\" applying the above principles to my situation, it can be argued that there exists a logical connection between the perceived prejudicial narrative (matter identified) and feared deviation from deciding on its legal and factual merits. as such, not once since the commencement of these proceedings has [ms m] or her stepmother been allowed to give evidence or even speak to cyps since to do so may expose a floor in a matter where the merits warrant such investigation but the bias neglects the possibility. therefore, while i understand opposing counsel's argument regarding my complaints about a \u2018prejudicial narrative,\u2019 i respectfully submit that these complaints do warrant serious consideration by this court. with regard to paragraph 36 again i must draw opposing counsel\u2019s attention to ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy, since in this case, the high court established a two-step test to determine whether there is a reasonable apprehension of bias. firstly, it must be established that the judge is in a situation which might give rise to an apprehension of bias. secondly, it must be determined whether this situation could cause a fair-minded lay observer to reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of the question to be decided. the relevance to my case is it provides the legal test for determining whether there is an apprehension of bias. in my case, i can argue that the judge's decision to prefer the cyps assessment and their refusal to make findings against the mother, despite my objections and concerns, could lead a fair-minded observer to reasonably apprehend that the judge may not bring an impartial mind to resolving the issues at hand. furthermore, in johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, 201 clr 488, the high court held that occasional robust exchanges between a judge and a litigant do not necessarily give rise to a perception of bias. the court also noted that judges are not expected to remain passive during proceedings and may express preliminary views on issues at hand. this case is relevant because it provides guidance on interpreting judicial conduct during proceedings. i can argue that in my case, while there may have been robust exchanges between the judge and the court room, this does not in itself establish bias or partiality on part of the judge. while in minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia legeng (2001) 205 clr 507 the high court held that actual bias requires demonstration that a judge was so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration by evidence or argument. this case is relevant because it sets out the standard for establishing actual bias. in my case, i argue that given my numerous unsuccessful applications and complaints, there may be grounds for arguing that the judge was committed to a particular conclusion irrespective of any evidence or argument presented by me or, in this case, the [region u] police as the judge made a clear and open statement in the court that he did not believe that the mother as guilty of any crime against [x] and that it was more likely than not that [x] was lying. in response to opposing counsel's argument regarding complaints concerning an interim determination, i would argue that my dissatisfaction with the court's interim decision is not about personal unhappiness but rather about perceived procedural unfairness and potential bias in favoring certain evidence over others without clear justification or explanation. i would further assert that my repeated complaints are attempts to seek justice and fairness in proceedings where i believe both i and my children, have been denied these rights. lastly, i would argue that even if expert evidence was against my position, it does not absolve the court from treating me fairly and impartially as required by law. conclusion in response to the conclusions of opposing counsel, in livesey v new south wales bar association [1983] hca 17, (1983) 151 clr 288, the high court held that actual or apprehended bias on the part of a decision-maker could be a ground for setting aside an administrative decision. the court established that even if there was no actual bias, the appearance of bias could be sufficient to undermine confidence in the impartiality of the decision-maker. this case is relevant as it sets out the test for apprehended bias and provides a precedent for challenging decisions on this basis. this counters opposing counsel's argument that none of my complaints from any basis for recusal. further in ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337 the court held that a judge should not hear a case if there is a reasonable suspicion or apprehension from a fair-minded observer that they might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of questions they are required to decide. this case is significant as it establishes the 'reasonable suspicion' test for apprehended bias, which applies in my situation. it can be used to argue against opposing counsel's assertion that there is no basis for recusal. then in johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, (2000) 201 clr 488 the high court ruled that judicial impartiality is an essential requirement for a fair trial and that judges should not show favouritism or prejudice towards any party. this case is relevant as it underscores the importance of judicial impartiality and can be used to argue against opposing counsel's contention that my complaints are without merit. in these cases, it was determined that even an appearance of bias can be grounds for recusal, demonstrating that my complaints do have potential merit under australian law. these cases highlight the importance of maintaining not just actual impartiality but also the appearance of impartiality in judicial proceedings. his honour: do you accept, though, that i\u2019ve made no formal rulings on such things, for the reasons that mr robinson has said, namely, the case is still in train, the evidence is not closed, there was meant to be today more evidence and, therefore, i can\u2019t and haven\u2019t made any formal rulings. [mr farrington]: yes. your honour \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: do you accept that? [mr farrington]: i\u2019m not looking into the future, your honour. i\u2019m looking \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: no, no, no. as of today. i haven\u2019t made any rulings about matters of evidence of, you know, who i believe or don\u2019t believe or what or what weight will be given to this as opposed to that. i haven\u2019t made any rulings, correct? [mr farrington]: you haven\u2019t. and i\u2019m not standing here to try and make you make a particular ruling. his honour: no, no, no. no. i\u2019m just saying that i haven\u2019t made any rulings. ... in breaking down the test to my speak, i did it sort of like: did i fear or do i fear that the judge\u2019s mind was already made up and, no matter what i said, i did not believe that i would get a fair hearing. that\u2019s how i\u2019ve sort of approached it and looked at it and wanting to be as open and as fair as possible on behalf of the kids. in talking about the principles and the case law, i know you all know this stuff backwards, i don\u2019t, but, coming out of mccall & clark: it\u2019s essential in any legal proceedings that all relevant evidence is thoroughly examined to ensure a fair outcome. to do otherwise would be to invite appeal, thereby necessarily extending court time. well, yes, we\u2019re here today and i understand that. but \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: and that\u2019s what we were going to do today. as mr robinson has said, we were going to get into \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 [mr farrington]: well, we weren\u2019t, your honour. we were going to get into some of the evidence and \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: we were going to do \u2013 we were going to get into more evidence. yes. [mr farrington]: your honour, we were going to get into some of the more whereas what i would have been asking for and asking for is for all of the all so we can all know the picture and \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: all of the all? [mr farrington]: i made that up. it\u2019s not a real term. but rather \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: i thought you were channelling our friend donald. [mr farrington]: not yet. his honour: that\u2019s rumsfeld. not the other one. [mr farrington]: but the frustration i have, your honour, is i pointed this problem out to chambers. i said \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry, which problem? [mr farrington]: the one about the subpoena not being broad enough to capture all the documentation that came back from the mother\u2019s new treating psychologist and it was spat back to me saying, \u201cno\u201d, and, \u201cdon\u2019t personally attack the icl.\u201d... ... in my case, my argument is i believe that the court has already formed views about my mental health, character, trustworthiness, and reliability from as far back as 2019 and that\u2019s how i honestly feel. his honour: and, again, upon what basis? like in terms of \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 [mr farrington]: yes. his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 rulings, and so forth, like, i\u2019ve made no comment again \u2013 i know this is terribly repetitive \u2013 i\u2019ve made no comment or ruling, for example, on anyone\u2019s credibility. so, just taking that aspect, upon what basis, apart from feeling, do you make that submission? [mr farrington]: at the end of day 1, when we were looking at getting [mr f] back and we finally figured out, after day 1, the way that the excellent mr haddock did his work was to bring my credibility into such a shambles that, when he was then \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: sorry to interrupt. sorry to interrupt. but, (a), that\u2019s your perception, obviously, of whatever mr haddock did or didn\u2019t do, but \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 farrington]: to take it like that, your honour, is somewhat flippant when what i\u2019m saying is that, if you\u2019re running a ship, you run it your way, and if anyone decides that they\u2019re going to do something wrong, they already know what the punishment is that you\u2019re going to give them. that\u2019s how i used to run my units. so if they decide to do something wrong, i would just give them the whole thing. but if there is a situation where you\u2019ve got someone as senior as an icl doing what i say she does, has done, it \u2013 to me, it feels contemptuous on your behalf and that\u2019s how i feel she has treated this courtroom and your position. that\u2019s how her actions made me feel. his honour: \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 (a), lawyers who appear before the court, (a), they\u2019re not my staff and that their primary duty \u2013 they\u2019ve actually got a primary duty to the court about proper evidence, truth, all that sort of thing, but they\u2019ve also got an understandable duty to their clients, right? secondly, though, a number of times today, where you\u2019ve referred to various adf leadership manuals, and so forth, would you accept, though, that, to transpose an adf leadership paradigm to the court or to civilian life, just doesn\u2019t apply? [mr farrington]: i do, your honour, which is why i put so much evidence to you and in front of you and for you and at each and every turn it was either refused or ignored. if what you were saying was the only case \u2013 and i thought about that a lot \u2013 we wouldn\u2019t be here. but because i put that information in front of you, including when the icl did not meet with the children, on your orders \u2013 and i laid it out, showed it, everything \u2013 still ignored and, your honour \u2011 \u2011 \u2011 his honour: but again \u2013 and sorry to interrupt \u2013 but, by definition, as i said earlier \u2013 and then mr robinson mentioned again \u2013 the title \u2013 the statutory office, under the family law act, requires them to be independent so that it\u2019s their judgment call as opposed to me or anyone else directing the icl because otherwise that would defeat the purpose of them being independent. the mother\u2019s submissions the obvious difficulty much of the difficulty the father faces is accusing the court of having \u2018placed weight on\u2019 or \u2018found\u2019 things when that is simply untrue. the court has had the judgment process frustrated by a re-opening occasioned by the father\u2019s breach of the court orders. this is a particularly apt point when considering that in circumstances where no final submissions were made by the independent children\u2019s lawyer as required because of the re-opening, much of the father\u2019s complaint faces difficulty. to be clear, the court has made an interim decision, has done so using the evidence of care and protection services whilst considering the father\u2019s lengthy arguments, and was at pains to make no specific findings against the father. the court performed the function it is enjoined to do and often does on an interim hearing. the father cannot reasonably suggest that the court, in doing so, acted in a way that founded an apprehension of bias under the relevant tests rather than his personal beliefs. that is particularly so where the opportunity to raise that matter was put to him fairly and squarely by [dr ff] (who, because she clarified an issue important for her client, he attacks and accuses of bullying, a scurrilous and baseless allegation). the father has not appealed that decision. the father simply does not like it, one can sympathise to a point. however, the constant attacks by the father against anyone and everyone he perceives as disagreeing with him in the document are deeply disturbing and consistent with the mother\u2019s evidence of his coercive and controlling nature. they are reminiscent of the attacks on the independent children\u2019s lawyer that were overwhelming and unrelenting, yet never met with the courage of an application if they were genuinely believed. otherwise, absent the father having a final decision from the court, it is rather unclear how he can opine to what the court has \u2018found\u2019 or \u2018put weight on\u2019 in circumstances where the court has not had the opportunity to make findings or place weight upon evidence. the complaints concerning misfeasance, res judicata, anshun estopppel, constitutional complaints, and complaints concerning the icl much ink is spilled by the father concerning these complaints. they can be distilled as follows:- a complaint about constitutional matters at [14]. the issue is nonsense given the referral of state power in the creation of this court, the terms of the family law act 1975 (cth), and indeed many of the documents the father goes on to cite, from [19]-[34], the father complains about res judicata and anshun estoppel. the submissions are flawed where it is well-established that these principles do not apply in parenting matters as outlined articulately in nygh j said in mcenearney & mcenearney [1980] famca 43, [1980] flc 90-866 and warnick j said in sps & pls [2008] famcafc 16, [2008] flc 93-363. quite aside from that, if the principles were to apply, the father\u2019s application would have been dismissed, and so it is difficult to understand how a determination of those matters if they did apply, which has effectively been in his favour, is relevant. whilst the father may now object to his own application being dealt with by the court. it is a position that is puzzling. the references to sections of the act that do not apply and strange allegations about threats are simply unhelpful. the father complains about a \u2018failure to respect article 18 of the iccpr\u2019. this is a confused allegation concerning \u2018badgering and intimidation\u2019, which is extraordinarily serious yet never explained. the father appears to object to people making legitimate submissions on behalf of their client in an adversarial system and suggests this somehow infringes article 18.2 of the iccpr. the argument fails entirely to understand the legal process and the iccpr. the argument is nonsense. complaints regarding the icl are scattered throughout the father\u2019s material. the complaints are interwoven with complaints about everyone else in the proceedings and their conduct. many are baseless assertions the father simply does not explain. some arise to allegations of conspiracy between the icl and the mother\u2019s lawyers, an extremely serious allegation of misconduct for which no evidence is advanced and is notably not protected by the advocate\u2019s immunity. at one point, the father ascribes blame to the icl that his lawyers had negligently chosen not to read subpoena material prior to a trial. many are complaints that the court allowed people to run the cases that they are entitled to run at law, but the father disagreed with them. the vast majority are canvassed at [117] to [147]. they are nonsense, expose a lack of understanding of tort law or advocates immunity, appear paranoid to be reserved, and are irrelevant where the icl is no longer part of these proceedings and did not make final submissions. where the icl did not make final submissions, it is rather unclear how there can be apprehended bias because of any view of the icl on the relevant tests. certainly, the father could not satisfy them. there also appears to be a lack of understanding that the icl was forced to withdraw because the father chose to make her a witness in proceedings because of his disagreement with her concerning [y], and then he failed to call the icl when offered the opportunity by the court- perhaps afraid that the truth would out, or it would be exposed as a deliberate tactic to neutralise what was perceived as an enemy. the \u2019request for judicial recusal\u2019 the father asserts that there should be a recusal. he effectively provides written submissions in his affidavit. they fail to appreciate large and important parts of the law and appear to refer to secret witnesses that the father does not name. some are simply strange ageist personal attacks that have no foundation. all complaints suffer from a common deficit- the court has made no findings that would form the basis of a recusal. the court would easily dispose of the inferences of actual bias. there is no evidence led by the father that even approaches the required standard in the authorities. relevant law the law in relation to a disqualification is well settled. an allegation of actual bias is a grave and exceptional allegation, as held in the matter of nadr v minister for immigration and multicultural affairs (2002) fca 361 (\u201cnadr\u201d). in that matter, justice emmett observed at paragraph 16: a finding of actual bias is a grave an exceptional matter. the accusation of such bias must be firmly established. it cannot be sufficient to establish actual bias to invite a court to find that would have come to a different decision from the decision-maker. even factual error or faulty reasoning, notwithstanding that the factual error might be serious or the reasoning might be totally illogical, is not of itself sufficient to lead to a finding of actual bias. similarly, the decision of reid v commercial club (albury) ltd (2014) nswca 98. the nsw court of appeal, of whom justice emmett was a member, conveniently summarised from paragraphs 68 to 69, the relevant principles as follows: a finding of actual bright bias is a grave matter. authority requires that an allegation of actual bias must be distinctly made and clearly proved, that such a finding should not be made lightly, and that cogent evidence is required. where the issue is actual bias in the form of pre-judgement, the appellant had to establish that the primary judge was so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or arguments may be presented. their honours in reid also referred to justice\u2019s gleeson cj and gummow j\u2019s observations in m minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia legeng 205 clr. 507 (\u201cjia\u201d), noting that \u201cthe question is not whether a decision-maker\u2019s mind is blank, it is whether it is open to persuasion\u201d. as his honour justice hayne opined in jia from paragraphs 185 to 186, there are several elements to a claim of actual bias, namely: the decision-maker has an opinion on a relevant aspect of the matter in issue in the particular case, the decision-maker will apply that opinion to the matter in issue, and the decision-maker will do so without giving the matter fresh consideration in the light of whatever may be the facts and arguments relevant to the particular case. their honours in reid stated justice hayne\u2019s opinion in jia that allegations of actual bias through prejudgement often fail at the third step he had identified. this was because notwithstanding whatever expression of preconceived opinions by the decision-maker, \u201cit does not follow that the evidence will be disregarded\u201d. with respect to the principles relating to apprehended bias, justice moore\u2019s decision in hartnett & sampson [2008] famca 75 sets out the principle. it is as follows: \u201cwhether the fair-minded observer would conclude the judge had formed opinions which might affect his or her determination of outstanding matters\u201d. as the full court opined in isbester v knox city council (2015) 255 clr in applying the test for apprehended bias, it is important to emphasise that the fair-minded lay observer \u201cis taken to be aware of the nature of the decision in the context in which it was made, as well as to have knowledge of the circumstances leading to the decision\u201d. this statement is a further refinement of his honour justice kirby\u2019s decision in johnson v johnson (2000) clr 488 at paragraph 53: the attributes of the fictitious bystander to whom the courts defer have been variously stated. such a person is not a lawyer. it neither is he or she a person wholly uninformed and uninstructed about the law in general or the issue to be decided. being reasonable and fair-minded, the bystander, before making a decision important to the parties and the community, would ordinarily need to be taken to have sought to be informed on at least the most basic considerations relevant to arriving at a conclusion founded on a fair understanding of all the relevant circumstances. the bystander must also now be taken to have, at least in a very general way, some knowledge of the fact that an adjudicator may properly adopt reasonable efforts to confine proceedings within appropriate limits and to ensure that time is not wasted. the fictitious bystander will also be aware of the very strong professional pressures on adjudicators (reinforced by the facilities of appeal and review) to uphold traditions of integrity and impartiality. finally a reasonable member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious (emphasis added). in the 1976 high court decision of r v watson [1976] hca 39, (1976) 136 clr 248 their honours opined: the view that a judge should not hear a case if in all the circumstances the parties or the public might reasonably suspect he was not unprejudiced and impartial, and that if a judge does sit in those circumstances prohibition will lie, is not only supported by the balance of authority as it now stands but is correct principle. it is of fundamental importance that the public should have confidence in the administration of justice. if fair-minded people reasonably apprehend all suspect that the tribunal has prejudged the case, they cannot have confidence in the decision. this last position was further explored in ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy [2000] hca 63, (2000) 205 clr 337, in case of real doubt it will often be prudent for a judge to decide whether or not to sit in order to avoid the inconvenience that could result if an appellate court were to take a different view of the matter of disqualification. other relevant decisions are, anae v r [2018] nswcca 73.(\u201canae\u201d) and that of the family court appeal division in huda & huda & laham [2018] famcafc 85.(\u201chuda\u201d). in anae, the test as expressed begins at paragraphs 50 and reads as follows: the test for apprehended bias is uncontroversial and the relevant principles were summarised by this court in tarrant where actual bias is not alleged. the legal test as expressed in johnson v johnson requires that the court is satisfied that a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. their honours subsequently state that this double test is by no means easy to apply and its application requires attention to four discrete elements, which are as follows: first there is the postulate of the fair-minded lay observer. their honours comment this reflects the principle that it is public confidence in the administration of justice which is sought to be preserved and not the capacity of a judge. secondly, the test is being described as \u2018objective\u2019 by which it is meant a third party\u2019s assessment of the judge\u2019s conduct and capacity, and not, as with actual bias and assessment of the judge\u2019s own state of mind. thirdly, there is said to be as two-stage process required, it is necessary to articulate \u2018the connection between the events giving rise to the apprehension of bias through pre-judgement and the possibility of departure from impartial persistent decision-making\u2019. fourthly, use of the term \u201cmight\u201d lowers the burden of proof below that of probabilities. thus the court not need not be satisfied that the fair-minded lay observer would have such an apprehension, nor need any apprehension in the mind of the observer involve a state of satisfaction on the probabilities. apprehended bias of the trial judge was found to exist. in the third matter of huda, apprehended bias was not found by the full court of the family court, however procedural unfairness was found based on the trial judge\u2019s interventions, the number of interventions, the length of the interventions, the circumstances of the intervention which led to procedural unfairness but not bias. a more recent, and respectfully pithy, summary was given in newett & newett (no. 6)[2022] fedcfamc1a 70 at [132], actual bias requires demonstration that the primary judge was: ... so committed to a conclusion already formed as to be incapable of alteration, whatever evidence or arguments may be presented\u201d (minister for immigration and multicultural affairs v jia legeng (2001) 205 clr 507 at [72]). such a finding is a grave matter, which should not be made lightly and requires cogent evidence (reid v commercial club (albury) ltd [2014] nswca 98 at [68]). a more throughgoing examination than the above was also outlined by the high court at [11]- [13] of charisteas & charisteas [2021] hca 29, (2021) 273 clr 289, of particular assistance in this matter are the observations made in johnson v johnson [2000] hca 48, (2000) 201 clr 488, galea v galea (1990) 19 nswlr 263 at 278-279 and garrett & freeman (no 3) [2007] nswlec 139 to the effect that the focus of the test is whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that a judge might not bring an impartial mind to the resolution of questions the judge is required to decide. further, and importantly, those authorities provide that it is not in doubt that judicial officers are not obliged to remain \u2018sphinx like\u2019 during the course of proceedings before them. the law permits a trial judge to express tentative or preliminary views without taking such expressions to indicate prejudgment, and trial judges \u201care not expected to wait until the end of the case before they start thinking about the issues, or to sit mute while evidence is advanced and arguments are presented\u201d. the authorities have further recognised that there can be robust exchanges between the bench and litigant, which do not constitute a reasonable apprehension of bias. in vfab v the minister for immigration and indigenous affairs [2003] fca 872, (2003) 131 fcr 102 at paragraph 81 kenny j said: - \u201coccasional displays of impatience and irritation, whether justified or not, will not amount to a disqualifying bias... momentary outbursts and misunderstandings in the often stressful work of adjudication must be tolerated, so long as they pass and do not affect the functions of the adjudicator\u201d numerous authorities had given further support for these sentiments. this court is a busy trial court. from time to time, judicial officers will find it necessary to warn parties of what is the likely outcome if they pursue a particular course of action, indeed such indications are to the benefit of the self-represented litigant. in antoun v r [2006] hca 2, (2006) 224 alr 51 at paragraph 27, kirby j had this to say in respect of that practice: \u201cfor centuries in courts of our tradition, judges have been telling parties and their lawyers, sometimes in quite robust terms, that they consider that a particular submission or course of action is hopeless, a waste of time or doomed to fail. i would not want to say anything that needlessly mollycoddled candid judicial speech...\u201d the task of the father it is for the father to satisfy these tests. the test of actual bias is the judge\u2019s state of mind, which can only be evidenced from the transcript. the father has chosen not to provide the transcript of the interim hearing or of the decision. the application must therefore fail. the test concerning apprehended bias similarly fails. the actual complaints the complaints of the father are a confusing and repetitive morass. they appear to fall into the following broad categories: complaints that \u2018due process\u2019 was not followed, complaints that the court \u2018bullied\u2019 the father, complaints that the court did not consider matters not in evidence and which were inadmissible, complaints that there is a \u2018prejudicial narrative\u2019, and an interim determination was made that was not in the father\u2019s favour. all of the above fail. concerning due process: the father was offered due process. indeed, his counsel was permitted to make identical applications during the trial where the first had already failed, and the trial was ultimately prevented from concluding on the father's application. the difficulty is that the father has focussed on his own view of due process and has done so in the way a self-represented litigant may do, which is understandable but not the proper focus. it is a pity that the father finds the descriptor of him as an experience litigant offensive, but it is a neutral and common description. suggesting there is apprehended bias where he is implored to seek legal assistance, having made more than ten unsuccessful applications in proceedings and resulting in more than seven costs orders against him which he now seeks to overturn (an interesting position of someone espousing res judicata) is simply wrongheaded. the complaints about equity demonstrate the father does not understand equity, particularly where he has been accorded more than sufficient procedural fairness. indeed it is in this sense the complaint of the father is most inapt- he complains about lack of punishment for others' perceived wrongdoing where time and again he has breached his undertaking to the [region u] magistrates court and has breached orders of this court and is yet to suffer a penalty. much of the father's complaint appears to stem from a wilful lack of knowledge of the proper operation of the act and of law alongside a fundamental misunderstanding of the role of the icl. indeed, much of the father's repeated complaint appears to focus on the icl not doing what he personally wanted her to do and tries to cloak that in some kind of issue for the court. the court cannot control the icl in the manner the father seems to think it can, and it is difficult to see how it could do so when the father made no recusal application despite being represented by counsel and being given an opportunity. the father proceeds on a wrongheaded assumption that findings have been made and seems to ignore the fact that the cyps assessment was hardly based on the input of the icl but after careful analysis of interviews and evidence. the father has the records of the supervision session conducted as part of that assessment. whilst the father may be aggrieved by the finding concerning his abuse and his other shortcomings, the fair-minded lay observer is not so burdened by the father's hurt feelings and need to avoid responsibility, a trait highlighted within the appraisal. a particularly egregious submission by the father comes from an alleged admission of an affidavit that was not, in fact, admitted. like many of the submissions made by the father, this is simply untrue. concerning bullying: the father's complaints about bullying are not supportable on any view of the conduct of this matter. the converse has been the father's repeated and baseless applications which demonstrate the pursuit of his own personal views at all costs and against all evidence. an apt summary would be that anyone who has disagreed with the father is not only wrong but liable to the most vicious of personal and professional attacks. a proper adversarial process in which matters are sought to be clarified concerning his position on recusal is hardly bullying. the position is simply trying to accord the father and everyone else procedural fairness. fortunately, the reasonable bystander is not the father and is not so burdened and is taken to have, at least in a very general way, some knowledge of the fact that an adjudicator may properly adopt reasonable efforts to confine proceedings within appropriate limits and to ensure that time is not wasted. the allegation of the father concerning bullying sits most uncomfortably with his stated intention to 'vehemently' appeal and write a complaint to a chief judge that does not exist and pursue an application to the administrative appeals tribunal, which has no jurisdiction at all so that would simply be an application of the father that was doomed to failure. concerning matters not in evidence: the father seeks to rely on an assortment of submissions to government enquiries and statements in review. these matters were not in evidence. they have not been put into evidence. they could not be admitted into evidence properly as extrinsic materials. the court cannot simply take notice of random things the father thinks it should, nor is bias somehow to be asserted to be found because various things that were not put before the court the father somehow thinks the court should understand. the position is untenable. the father makes a bizarre allegation concerning some secret person who will advance some claim of apprehended bias. it is a strange and disturbing submission, similar to his new attack on the paternal grandfather whose svengali-like powers he now alleges are used to control the bench. complaints of a \u2018prejudicial narrative\u2019: no one could have any understanding from the father\u2019s application what this phrase is meant to mean, the father seems to think the court should interrogate the mother\u2019s case. it undoubtedly will if it is ever permitted to make a decision that is not delayed by a breach of orders by the father. conversely, the father seems to think that none of his patent deficiencies in empathy or insight and his acts of family violence should be accounted for, but that does not seem to be a basis for apprehended bias, it is unclear how a complaint of this nature could ever find apprehended bias, especially where the authorities make it clear the judge is not to remain \u2018sphinx like\u2019. complaints concerning an interim determination: the father being unhappy does not found apprehended bias. had the father listened and attempted to understand the decision, he would have reflected that the decision preferred the evidence of the cyps assessment, referenced it carefully, and was at pains not to make findings against the father. there was no other option for the court if it was to follow [100] of ss & ah [2010] famcafc 13, and in each instance, the father\u2019s complaints are a self-justifying and concerning repeat of what he has already asserted unsuccessfully. whilst doubtless, the father believes his case is straightforward, the independent fair-minded observer is not burdened by the father\u2019s wrongheaded convictions but would take a balanced view of the evidence and, in particular, the careful expert evidence which was against the father\u2019s case. conclusion none of these complaints found any form of basis for recusal. the application is entirely bereft of merit and is an abuse of process. it is flawed from beginning to conclusion. notably, many of the father\u2019s orders sought to progress the matter could never have been made if his application was successful, and the idea that the mother should be \u2018declared an unreliable witness and a vexatious litigant\u2019 demonstrates a determination to give the mother no \u2018due process\u2019 at all and to fail to reflect that if the history was examined alongside the numerous costs orders the vexatious litigant would appear to be the father. the situation is unfortunate, but there is no basis for recusal. if anything, the father\u2019s quite unbalanced affidavit would give the court pause for concern about the father\u2019s mental health. the director-general\u2019s submissions n]: for over 20 years i have worked in a space where i have focused on children, and worked with an agency that is guided by the best interests of children. but when i read this application i cannot help but think of a young child that is perhaps throwing a tantrum and not getting what he wants and going to another parent. it is astounding that an allegation has been made that this court has allowed, or has any control over, an independent children\u2019s representative and some allegation that the icl, being [ms bb], could possibly pressure the director general to affect not one but two appraisals with regards to safety of children. to suggest that the director general\u2019s appraisals and the conclusions that are drawn were tainted or fundamentally flawed due to any form of communication by an independent child representative is deeply flawed and incredibly concerning, and, to be frank, your honour, offensive. section 8 of the children and young people act is the guiding section that the director general looks to, which is, effectively, the paramountcy principle. that paramountcy principle indicates that at all times the director general must prioritise and place at paramount the best interests of children and young people in the work that we do. to suggest that we have completed appraisals and stepped aside from that paramountcy principle is firmly rejected, is incorrect. i have no doubt that [mr farrington] is distressed by any proceedings in relation to his children. i don\u2019t envy him in is position at all. i have no doubt that [mr farrington] is distressed or frustrated by the conclusion of the second appraisal, being that he is not willing and able to care for and protect his children from abuse and neglect. those feelings are not a valid reason to make a recusal application. it is not required of any court to step into the mind of each person at the bar table or each parent and to account for their feelings. in this court, just like the director general, the best interests of children are paramount. ... simply put, to make an application for recusal on the basis that the director general\u2019s appraisals have been influenced in any way, shape or form is incorrect, and the application must fail. we thank our friend for the aide-memoire and we rely on its contents. the icl\u2019s submissions there has been much in the way of assertion. there has been much in the way of submission. there has been little in the way of evidence to support those claims. at paragraph 132 the father seeks to clarify his position. subparagraph (a): i am expressing my concern. so it\u2019s a subjective conclusion without the basis, without the support of evidence. there is no evidence, in my submission, to support an application that your honour should need to recuse yourself and, if i can conclude by referring to paragraph 14 of the father\u2019s second set of submissions, which, again, turns on a belief, a subjective view, there simply is no evidence that the court has already formed views about his mental health, character, trustworthiness and reliability at 2019 and there simply is no evidence that the court hasn\u2019t and won\u2019t consider any and all new evidence in submissions that may be made if this trial is allowed to continue and conclude. outline of principle ... the approach of this court has now travelled beyond the apparent approbation of judicial silence expressed in r v watson, ex parte armstrong. in the united states of america, such silence has been held, on occasion, to constitute a denial of due process. it deprives the party who will ultimately be affected by judicial conclusions of the \u201copportunity, before judgment, to be heard to correct and to persuade.\u201d just as the judge should, to a proper extent, listen, so the judge should, to a proper extent, express any tentative views. ... the problem in the present case was that the views, as expressed, and re-expressed were not tentative, or not apparently so. they were stated peremptorily, repeated emphatically and given force by later remarks and actions, including the unrequested decision as to bail. it is true that, in the oft-repeated and oft-applied words of mason j in re jrl, ex parte cjl, this court has \u201cloudly and clearly\u201d expressed a corrective against any view that a judge should too readily accept recusal because a party has demanded it. in the administration of justice in australia, the parties do not (at least normally) have an entitlement to choose among the judicial officers who will conduct the trial. this principle has been reasserted and applied in many cases. whatever may have been the tradition in earlier times, opinions favouring silence on the part of an adjudicator during a hearing (which is the surest means of avoiding most allegations of prejudgment) are now seen as carrying risks of an even greater injustice. unless the adjudicator exposes the trend of his or her thinking, a party may be effectively denied justice because that party does not adduce evidence or present argument that could have settled the adjudicator's undisclosed concerns. a frank dialogue will commonly be conducive to the avoidance of oversight and the repair of misapprehensions. uninformed members of the public are doubtless sometimes surprised by the robust exchanges which take place in court, especially between a judge and experienced lawyers. but judges and other adjudicators and lawyers know that such dialogue can have great value. changes that have come about in the administration of justice, including the increase in the number of trials by single judges, have also required, to some extent, an adjustment to the rules of reticence in judicial observations that may still be appropriate where trials, criminal or civil, are conducted before a jury. one of the reasons for such changes has been the desire to increase the efficient management of the trial process. yet it is in that context that the expressions of preliminary and tentative views may sometimes appear to an outsider to indicate prejudgment. although some adjudicators may be hard to shift from tentative opinions, lawyers know that, in most judicial decision-making, the process is a continuous one. preliminary inclinations do change. the attributes of the fictitious bystander to whom courts defer have therefore been variously stated. such a person is not a lawyer. yet neither is he or she a person wholly uninformed and uninstructed about the law in general or the issue to be decided. being reasonable and fair-minded, the bystander, before making a decision important to the parties and the community, would ordinarily be taken to have sought to be informed on at least the most basic considerations relevant to arriving at a conclusion founded on a fair understanding of all the relevant circumstances. the bystander would be taken to know commonplace things, such as the fact that adjudicators sometimes say, or do, things that they might later wish they had not, without necessarily disqualifying themselves from continuing to exercise their powers. the bystander must also now be taken to have, at least in a very general way, some knowledge of the fact that an adjudicator may properly adopt reasonable efforts to confine proceedings within appropriate limits and to ensure that time is not wasted. the fictitious bystander will also be aware of the strong professional pressures on adjudicators (reinforced by the facilities of appeal and review) to uphold traditions of integrity and impartiality. acting reasonably, the fictitious bystander would not reach a hasty conclusion based on the appearance evoked by an isolated episode of temper or remarks to the parties or their representatives, which was taken out of context. finally, a reasonable member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or suspicious. sometimes judicial interventions and observations can exceed what is a proper and reasonable expression of tentative views. whether that has happened is a matter of judgment taking into account all of the circumstances of the case. however, one thing that is clear is that the expression of tentative views during the course of argument as to matters on which the parties are permitted to make full submissions does not manifest partiality or bias. taken cumulatively, his honour\u2019s interventions and reasons for judgment do not give rise to an apprehension of bias. critical, strong and candid they may have been, but excessively so they were not. to some extent they may be taken to be expressions of exasperation, unfortunately so perhaps, but as a matter of degree, still falling short of apparent bias. ] ... whether a fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might not bring an impartial and unprejudiced mind to the resolution of the question the judge is required to decide. [32] as the plurality in johnson v johnson explained, \u201c[t]he hypothetical reasonable observer of the judge's conduct is postulated in order to emphasise that the test is objective, is founded in the need for public confidence in the judiciary, and is not based purely upon the assessment by some judges of the capacity or performance of their colleagues.\u201d [33] because the test is objective it is important to keep an inquiry about apprehension of bias distinct from any inquiry about actual bias. an inquiry about actual bias in the form of prejudgment would require assessment of the state of mind of the judge in question. no doubt that would have to be done, at least for the most part, on the basis of what the judge had said and done. but to allow an inquiry about whether the judge had in fact prejudged some issue to enter into a debate about what a fair-minded lay observer might apprehend is to introduce considerations that are irrelevant to the issue that is to be decided when a party submits that there is or was a reasonable apprehension of bias. ] in ebner v official trustee in bankruptcy, the plurality pointed out that application of the apprehension of bias principle requires two steps. first, it requires the identification of what it is said might lead the judge to decide a case other than on its legal and factual merits. and second, there must be an articulation of the logical connection between that matter and the feared deviation from the course of deciding the case on its merits. the plurality in ebner went on to say that \u201c[t]he bare assertion that a judge (or juror) has an 'interest' in litigation, or an interest in a party to it, will be of no assistance until the nature of the interest, and the asserted connection with the possibility of departure from impartial decision making, is articulated.\u201d so too, in this case, the bare assertion that the judge appeared to be biased through prejudgment would be of no assistance without articulation of the connection between the events giving rise to the apprehension of bias through prejudgment and the possibility of departure from impartial decision making. ... [67] ... an allegation of apprehended bias requires an objective assessment of the connection between the facts and circumstances said to give rise to the apprehension and the asserted conclusion that the judge might not bring an impartial mind to bear upon the issues that are to be decided. an allegation of apprehended bias does not direct attention to, or permit consideration of, whether the judge had in fact prejudged an issue. to ask whether the reasons for judgment delivered after trial of the action somehow confirm, enhance or diminish the existence of a reasonable apprehension of bias runs at least a serious risk of inverting the proper order of inquiry (by first assuming the existence of a reasonable apprehension). inquiring whether there has been \u201cthe crystallisation of that apprehension in a demonstration of actual prejudgment\u201d impermissibly confuses the different inquiries that the two different allegations (actual bias and apprehended bias) require to be made. and, no less fundamentally, an inquiry of either kind moves perilously close to the fallacious argument that because one side lost the litigation the judge was biased, or the equally fallacious argument that making some appealable error, whether by not dealing with all of the losing side's arguments or otherwise, demonstrates prejudgment. ] here, however, it was said that \u201cthe fact that one party appeared before the judge on seven separate days in closed court raised a different and additional concern.\u201d that concern was identified as the possibility \u201cin such circumstances that the judge's mind will become familiar with the character of the plaintiff's case to an extent that, consciously or subconsciously, there will be a tendency to place the further evidence within the pre-existing mental structure\u201d (emphasis added). but the existence of a \u201cconcern\u201d described as the possibility of placing the evidence led at trial into a \u201cpre-existing mental structure\u201d does not demonstrate that the fair-minded lay observer might reasonably apprehend that the judge might have prejudged an issue to be decided at trial. in order to establish such a reasonable apprehension it is necessary to analyse more closely the connection that is asserted between the conduct and disposition of interlocutory applications and the possibility of prejudgment. [70] the fact that einstein j made several ex parte interlocutory orders and on each occasion directed that those applications, the material in support, the reasons for making the orders and the orders themselves not be disclosed to one side of the litigation did not found a reasonable apprehension of prejudgment of the issues that were to be fought at trial. it may well be that the directions not to disclose material should not have been left in force for as long as they were. perhaps they should not have been made at all. but if their making or the failure to limit their duration was wrong, that did not found a reasonable apprehension of bias. consideration and disposition as you may be aware, judge neville is currently subject to a recusal application by me, however, somewhat paradoxically, owing to his continuity of knowledge of this case, he may be the one best suited to preside in this instance, if he is willing. the rules and case-law certainly allow for it. associate: dated: 19 october 2023 dated: 19 october 2023 [1] for earlier hearings, the father was legally represented.[2] at the outset of the recusal hearing on 16th august 2023, for abundant caution, i went through the 189 paragraphs of the father\u2019s affidavit, summarily, with occasional comment. see t 5 \u2013 15 of the transcript from this date.[3] t 16, 17, 18, 25 & 26.[4] t 50 & 51.[5] t 50, 51 & 52.[6] t 56.[7] t 57. see the father\u2019s further comments about his \u201cholistic view\u201d of his experience: at t 57 & 58. he made further remarkable comments about certain lawyers (notably icls), apparently, having some secret access to me and my chambers, some sort of \u201copen door policy.\u201d unsurprisingly, i refuted such outrageous contentions. t 59.

the court accepts the allegations of physical abuse of the children and concern about [ms domara]\u2019s propensity for violence, then it would be considered appropriate that [mr melton] have sole parental responsibility for the children.[11] there is no magic in a family report. a judge is not bound to accept it and there should never be a suggestion that the counsellor is usurping the role of the court or that the judge is abdicating his responsibilities...\u201d conceded that provided structures were in place to assist in decision making, equal shared parent responsibility could be ordered in this case. her primary concern was to ensure that there was no detriment to the children if the parties could not communicate, (2) agreed to a question from the mother\u2019s counsel that there was a risk in the mother being displaced from the children\u2019s lives if an order was made for sole parental responsibility, (3) considered that an equal shared care arrangement with children of a young age could be problematic, particularly if communication between the parties is poor. she agreed that handovers at school would assist in reducing the direct interaction between the parties and further would allow the mother to engage in the school community, and (4) conceded that the child x had not described any recent episodes of being smacked by her mother stating that this had

the opportunity observe the demeanour of the witnesses under cross-examination. (2) in this case, the evidence supports a clear finding that the father attempted to influence the outcome of the family report by discussing with y the allegation that she had been \u201cslapped\u201d as a baby by the mother and that she should \u201ctell\u201d the family consultant. the father conceded at trial that he had never observed the mother engage in this behaviour. the mother denied that it ever occurred. (3) the cctv footage of the physical altercation between the parties at the mother\u2019s unit complex in late 2021 (exhibit f2) was distressing to watch but clear as to what had occurred. whilst the mother had initiated the physical exchange by attempting to retrieve her mobile telephone from the father, his response was disproportionate to the mother\u2019s actions. the father\u2019s reaction is all the more egregious when considering the difference in size between the parties and the fact that the father is trained as a community worker. (4) it is difficult to reconcile the weight attached by the family consultant to the disputed allegations about the mother in the face of clear video evidence of family violence perpetrated by the father. (5) the court is unable to place any weight on the perceived wishes of either child given the court\u2019s concerns about the children being exposed to the father\u2019s negative view of the mother and the reports made by the children of their mother\u2019s conduct, which the family consultant conceded could not possibly come from their own memory. further, the mother also conceded in her evidence to discussing future living arrangements with the children.[14] in this case, the evidence supports a clear finding that the father attempted to influence the outcome of the family report by discussing with y the allegation that she had been \u201cslapped\u201d as a baby by the mother and that she should \u201ctell\u201d the family consultant. the father conceded at trial that he had never observed the mother engage in this behaviour. the mother denied that it ever occurred.

[8] storage arrangements for the valuable item: 53. i asked [mr fergus]\u201cto take the valuable items up to the safe at your dad\u2019s?\u201d [mr fergus] did not reply but simply smiled. knowing [mr fergus] so well, i interpreted his smile as a \u2018yes\u2019. i always wanted the valuable items with me. leadup to these property settlement proceedings: conduct of these proceedings: the company sold the valuable item. i haven\u2019t got the money to pay it back. the company sold the valuable items to me. i haven\u2019t got the money to pay the company back\u201d. emphasis) the valuable items go missing: me: i think you have been broken into. [mr fergus]: why? me: the door is wide open and there is stuff everywhere. i am too scared to go inside. [mr fergus]: just call the police. subsequent events: acct set up non-secured loan over valuable items purchase [2020] $418,715 direct fm bus 25 yrs if mortgage taken out repayments will place this client in unnecessary hardship marriage breakdown business slowed due to mental health break valuable items were stolen was purchased in name of director not company. should invoice be changed? 28 days for private ruling apply through tap per lady on phone (#...) ato receipt # ... hi [mr cc], attached is our response to your ethical letter regarding [e pty ltd] and [mr fergus]. ... i have not included a workpaper for division 7a or director\u2019s loans as this amount was paid back in 2022 and there was no further action required. this can be seen in the quickbooks file. there is a fixed asset amount for valuable item which originally was recorded against a loan account but i believe it was purchased by the company. the valuable item has since been stolen and needs to be written off as a loss. ... as there is no paperwork provided we cannot establish that the ownership of this asset is that of the company ([e pty ltd] ), therefore we cannot claim a tax deduction for the write off despite the previous accountant ([ms v]), noting so, email below for file note. [mr fergus] has advised that this \u201cvaluable item\u201d asset has gone missing and that it was not insured. treatment is to remove this as an asset to the company as we cannot establish ownership, and that asset is held with [mr fergus] on a personal nature, noting division 7a tax implications advised to [mr fergus] and that interest will be required in the next 12 months with minimum repayments also to be met. fraud? the truth is that, when the law requires the proof of any fact, the tribunal must feel an actual persuasion of its occurrence or existence before it can be found. it cannot be found as a result of a mere mechanical comparison of probabilities independently of any belief in its reality. no doubt an opinion that a state of facts exists may be held according to identified gradations of certainty, and this has led to attempts to define exactly the certainty required by law for various purposes... except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. but reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. the seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. in such matters \u201creasonable satisfaction\u201d should not be produced by inexact proofs, indefinite testimony, or indirect inferences. waste? as a statement of general principle, i am firmly of the view that financial losses incurred by the parties or either of them in the course of a marriage whether such losses result from a joint or several liability, should be shared by them (although not necessarily equally) except in the following circumstances: where one of the parties had embarked upon a course of conduct designed to reduce or minimise the effective value or worth of matrimonial assets, or (b) where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. where one of the parties has acted recklessly, negligently or wantonly with matrimonial assets, the overall effect of which has reduced or minimised their value. item 15 \u2013 loan from husband\u2019s father ($70,000): e bank statement annexure \u2018g\u2019 was tendered as exhibit 15. the narration for the $35,000 advance is \u201cloan [mr c]\u201d, and narration for the $20,000 and $15,000 transactions are \u201c[mr fergus] loan [mr c] \u201d.] item 16 \u2013 loan from ms h contributions of the parties initial contributions: contributions during the marriage: post-separation contributions: other matters arising pursuant to section 79 including future factors the just & equitable requirement i am satisfied that the unstated assumptions underpinning the parties\u2019 relationships were that during the relationship they were each free to deal with their assets as they chose to do so. they gave effect to that assumption during the relationship. the parties did not intermingle their financial affairs and did not conduct a joint personal bank account. they held and dealt with their real property, being their single biggest asset, free of consultation or consideration of what the other party may have thought was appropriate to do. the respondent had the benefit of occupation of the applicant\u2019s home rent free whilst making her home available for use to her son. her children lived in the applicant\u2019s home for periods of time. there is no presumption that following the breakdown of a relationship lasting 15 years that an order should be made adjusting the parties\u2019 legal and equitable interests in the property. there must be a principled basis for doing so, arising out of how the parties conducted their relationship. i am not satisfied that one has been established. i am not satisfied that it is just and equitable to make an order. the wife in moretto appealed unsuccessfully (cosola & moretto [2023] fedcfamc1a 61). to take on the words from stanford, there is no \u201cprincipled reason\u201d for the court to now interfere with how these parties chose to live their married life together, whether in respect of superannuation, or non-superannuation. the \u201cunstated\u201d or \u201cimplicit assumptions\u201d between these two parties was they would keep their finances separate \u2013 this is no more obvious than the fact that the wife has managed to accumulate savings, in her own name, in the amount of about $225,000. conclusion & orders associate: dated: 20 october 2023 dated: 20 october 2023 [1] in his proposed orders, the husband sought a declaration in slightly different terms, namely that he held a 25% beneficial interest, with his father holding the other 75%. the difference does not matter on my analysis of the case.[2] mr c\u2019s sister bought the block, mr c built a house on it, his sister paid for the build and when the block was later sold mr c and his sister divided the profits equally.

effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d being served by orders which do not give one parent \u201coptimal\u201d arrangements or outcomes. a discretionary judgment concerning parenting orders necessarily involves, because of the focus upon the future, significant elements of value judgments, assumptions, necessarily uncertain predictions and intuition. the objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by: (a) ensuring that children have the benefit of both of their parents having a meaningful involvement in their lives, to the maximum extent consistent with the best interests of the child, and (b) protecting children from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence, and (c) ensuring that children receive adequate and proper parenting to help them achieve their full potential, and (d) ensuring

considerations meaningful relationship meaningful relationships with both parents are critical to the children's development of positive attachment relationships. attachment allows children to develop the secure base necessary to explore their world, relate to others, and regulate their emotions adaptively. elevations in risk appeared to primarily relate to her capacity to continue supporting a relationship between the children and their father and avoid exposing them to adult issues and/or conflict. risks to the children the father\u2019s alcohol use the father\u2019s road rage believed that her father had difficulty regulating his anger at times. she indicated that he has a history of becoming upset while driving, and she has been fearful that he will ram another vehicle or get into a physical fight with another driver. she described her father as having a loud and deep voice, that she finds frightening when directed at her. she denied that he had ever physically hurt her. the father exposing the children to conflict analysis of risk additional considerations the wishes of the children relationships with each parent impact on the children of any change reasonable practicability ability to meet the children\u2019s needs an extended block of time also allows them to develop deeper relationships with each parent without feeling like they must constantly adjust to different living situations. family violence and intervention orders freedom of movement assessing competing proposals advantages of moving to region b disadvantages of moving to region b advantages of living in suburb c disadvantages of living in suburb c what orders are in the best interests of the children? while moving to [region b] may have its advantages in terms of lifestyle and/or more affordable housing, it is likely that this would be offset by the children having an integrated experience across time with their mother and father. further, it would not be practical for them to have midweek time with their father. both or one parent is going to have to do a significant amount of driving, and the children will miss out on parties and social events, particularly as they enter high school. it would be in the children's best interests to reside closer to school and each parent. it is likely that if the children remained residing in the suburbs of melbourne that this would be more achievable. thus, while relocation is a matter for the court, based on the needs of the children, it would not be recommended in this instance. long summer holiday time the children\u2019s birthdays

the power under s 79 and 80(1)(h) of the act to make an interim property order the \u201coverarching consideration\u201d is the interests of justice. it is not necessary to establish compelling circumstances. all that is required is that in the circumstances it is appropriate to exercise the power. in exercising the wide and unfettered discretion conferred by the power to make such an order, regard should be had to the fact that the usual order pursuant to s 79 is a once and for all order made after a final hearing. in relation to the second matter, as the jurisdiction under s 79 of the act is being exercised the provision of that section must be considered and applied but with limitations given that it is not the final hearing. there is also no requirement of compelling circumstances in relation to the substantive step. it seems likely to the court that...the applicant...will be likely to receive by way of property settlement a sum sufficient to cover the advance, that would seem to be sufficient to enable the order sought to be made. the interim order must be capable of variation or reversal without resort to s 79a of the act or appeal. whether the power under ss 79 and 80(1)(h) of the act should be exercised, (b) if so, then an assessment of the factors contained in s 79 of the act is to occur, and (c) an assessment as to whether any interim amount in this matter is able to be \u2018clawed back\u2019 at a final hearing stage. if so, then an assessment of the factors contained in s 79 of the act is to occur, and (c) an assessment as to whether any interim amount in this matter is able to be \u2018clawed back\u2019 at a final hearing stage. an assessment as to whether any interim amount in this matter is able to be \u2018clawed back\u2019 at a

are even more so given the asserted incomes of the parties, (3) the moratorium on the cessation of mortgage repayments ceases in late 2023 and there is therefore some significant urgency to effecting sale of some property to alleviate the parties\u2019 financial hardship. further, even if u bank agreed to extend the moratorium on mortgage repayments for a further period, whilst this might provide immediate financial relief, it ultimately only continues to increase the parties\u2019 liabilities and further diminish the property pool which will be available for distribution at final hearing, (4) the husband\u2019s proposal is time consuming and will result in an increased risk of u bank foreclosing. this in turn carries the risk of a reduction in the prices able to be obtained for the properties if they are sold by way of mortgagee auctions, thereby diminishing rather than preserving the property pool, (5) the sale of the suburb c property is well progressed and there is advice that the offer is strong, (6) the husband has previously agreed to both the sale of the suburb c property and the suburb l property and in the manner in which the wife now seeks the court order, (7) the husband asserts that the value of the suburb c property exceeds the offer but would not agree to the expediated valuation of that property. indeed, the base for the husband\u2019s opposition to the wife\u2019s proposal seems to shift and on the material currently before the court may, perhaps, be seen to be driven by factors other than a desire to maximise and preserve the property pool, (8) the husband\u2019s proposal will result in the retention of the suburb c property, the suburb e property and the suburb j property. the town q property will also be retained (noting that there is no suggestion by either party that the town q property be sold and also noting that this property is unencumbered). however, under the husband\u2019s proposal the suburb e property and the suburb j property will remain encumbered, with the parties having little (if any) capacity to meet the ongoing mortgage and other liabilities associated with those properties. indeed, counsel for the husband conceded at the hearing that this is the effect of the husband\u2019s proposal, (9) the suburb c property is unencumbered and therefore under the wife\u2019s proposal the entire net proceeds of the sale will be available to be applied to the parties liabilities. under the wife\u2019s proposal, on the material currently before the court, it appears that sale of the suburb c property and the suburb l property would likely allow the mortgages on the suburb e property, the suburb g property and the suburb j property to be discharged and for those properties to be retained by the parties unencumbered. it is of note that the suburb e property is the most valuable real property asset in the pool and is retained unencumbered under the wife\u2019s proposal. further, the wife and children reside at the suburb e property, which is the former matrimonial home, and the husband resides at the suburb j property. the town q property is to be retained and is also unencumbered. accordingly, under the wife\u2019s proposal all the properties to be retained by the parties would likely be unencumbered. this is of considerable significance given the parties\u2019 asserted limited incomes and therefore limited capacity to service any mortgage. additionally, as the suburb g property is leased, it would also provide rental income for the use of the parties, i consider the wife\u2019s

[169] moreover, the resolution of parenting proceedings in this court usually requires consideration of not only the credibility of the parties as witnesses or litigants but appreciation of the characters and personalities of them as people whose future relationship, or the context of that relationship with their child, the court has the responsibility to decide. ] we agree with those observations. it follows from them that in parenting proceedings an adverse credit finding against a parent should not only be necessary to determine the real issues joined between the parties but should be soundly based, with due allowance for the limitations referred to. family law act provisions 4ab definition of family violence etc. for the purposes of this act, family violence means violent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person\u2019s family (the family member), or causes the family member to be fearful.

summary, in dealing with any parenting application by a person interested in the care, welfare or development of a child, a court will determine that application applying the relevant provisions of part vii to determine whether making (or not making) a parenting order would be in the child's best interests. ... at the conclusion of the hearing counsel for the mother submitted that greater caution was required of a court determining a parenting application involving a person other than parents and grandparents. she submitted the legislation encouraged a more cautious approach when the application included a member of the group she described as \u201cothers\u201d. whilst we readily acknowledge the importance of the relationship between a child and his or her parents, we cannot give blanket endorsement to this submission. as is clearly demonstrated in the case law, each parenting case turns uniquely on its own facts (see for example mulvany & lane). ... ... in summary we would answer the questions posed at paragraph 52 as follows: \u201c(i) a two step approach is appropriate in dealing with an application for parenting orders brought by a person other than a parent, a child, or a grandparent. in other words is the applicant a person concerned with the care, welfare or development of the child (step 1) and if so, what order should be made in the best interests of the child. this consideration may lead to an order for parental responsibility, an order a child live with, spend time and or communicate with the person, or that no such order be made (step 2), (ii) s 65c does not prescribe a hierarchy of applicants. the application falls to be determined under s 60ca guided by the objects and principles in s 60b(1) and s 60b(2) and based on consideration of relevant matters under s 60cc(2) and s 60cc(3), ... ... the flexibility afforded by s 60cc(3)(m), and the ability to deal with aspects of the application under s 60cc(3)(f) involving a party who was not a parent was explained by moore j in potts and bims & ors [2007] famca 394 at paragraph 8 (see also mulvany & lane at paragraphs 76 and 77 per may & thackray jj). ... ] if a court is satisfied that an approach to the upbringing of a child by a parent or parents in whatever way is contrary to that child\u2019s best interests, then the court should interfere by putting in place appropriate orders. in the absence of substantive issues as to the child\u2019s best interests, it is not the role of a court to peer over the shoulders of functional parents and second guess the decisions they make regarding the upbringing of their children. a court should only intervene in such decision-making in a cautious, careful and thoughtful manner and consider whether a better approach is to make no order at all. role and application of section 60b ms smallwood: your honour, you were asked to approach this matter through the perspective of the parents of [y] and [x]. it has been urged upon you that the parents should have the right to bring up their children, the parents should not... have to give up their time for [ms avonlea] to visit the children. [that] [t]hey should not be told what to do with respect to their parenting roles. all of those submissions and implications fly in the face of the purpose of the act, and if you look at section 60b of the objects... and principles underlying the parenting aspects of the act, 60b(ii)(b) says: ... the principles underlying these objects all that except when it is or would be contrary to the children's best interests, (b) that the children have a right to spend time on a regular basis and communicate on a regular basis with both their parents- and my emphasis[2] \u2013 and other people significant to their care welfare and development, such as grandparents and other relatives. ... it has been said that where the enacting part of a statute is clear and unambiguous it cannot be cut down by the preamble. but this does not mean that a court cannot obtain assistance from the preamble in ascertaining the meaning of an operative provision. the particular section must be seen in its context, the statute must be read as a whole and recourse to the preamble may throw light on the statutory purpose and object. there is, however, one difficulty in seeking to restrict the generality of the operative provision by reference to a suggested restriction expressed in the preamble: it is that parliament may intend to enact a provision which extends beyond the actual problem sought to be remedied. recognition of this difficulty led viscount simonds in attorney-general v. prince ernest augustus of hanover to say \u201cthat the context of the preamble is not to influence the meaning otherwise ascribable to the enacting part unless there is a compelling reason for it\u201d. see also pp. 460\u2013461, 462\u2013463. ... (footnote omitted) the wacando principles have been widely applied to the use and scope of objects clauses. it follows that objects clauses can be used as an aid to the construction of words of legislation (russo v aiello (2003) 215 clr 643). however, intention is to be gleaned from the whole act and, in addition to objects clauses, regard must be had to other sections (municipal officers assoc of australia v lancaster (1981) 37 alr 559). applying wacando, in s v australian crime commission [2005] fca 1310, (2005) 144 fcr 431 at [22] mansfield j said \u201c[s]uch a [objects] clause cannot cut down the plain and unambiguous meaning of a provision if that meaning in its textual and contextual surroundings is clear\u201d. and, in minister for urban affairs & planning v rosemount estates pty ltd (1996) 91 lgera 31 at page 78, cole ja said that \u201c... whilst regard may be had to an objects clause to resolve uncertainty or unambiguity, the objects clause does not control clear statutory language, or command a particular outcome of exercise of discretionary power\u201d. wacando was decided before b & b: family law reform act 1995 but it seems, was not brought to the attention of the full court. we think it is highly unlikely that had the full court in b & b: family law reform act 1995 been invited to consider wacando that this aspect of the case would have been decided the same way. with wacando and the cases which follow it in mind, we must respectfully disagree with b & b: family law reform act 1995 to the extent that that decision held that s 60b does more than provide context, indicate the legislative purpose of the part and operate as an aid to construction of the act. thus, we do not agree that in deciding a parenting case it was necessary to discuss the significance and weight of relevant s 60b factors or that where the outcome of s 60cc deliberations did not enable the court to determine a parenting order, s 60b may be decisive. section 60b has been significantly amended including by the family law amendment (shared parental responsibility) act (2006) (cth) which inserted at the commencement of s 60b the words \u201cthe objects of this part are to ensure that the best interests of children are met by...\u201d these words do no more than reinforce the relationship between s 60b and s 60cc and put beyond doubt that in relation to how a court determines what is in a particular child\u2019s best interests, the facultative provisions are ss 60ca and 60cc and (where it applies) s 65aa. these words do not operate so as to elevate the role of s 60b beyond that envisaged by wacando. the same must be said about the court\u2019s ability to take into account \u201cany other fact or circumstance\u201d that the court thinks is relevant (s 60cc(3)(m)). thus, in its current form, s 60b does no more than provide context, indicate the legislative intention or purpose of the part and otherwise operate as an aid to construction of the part and the act. it follows that we do not agree that the current s 60b can be used to change the ordinary and clear meaning of s 60cc or that where the s 60cc deliberations do not enable the court to determine whether or not a parenting order is in a child\u2019s best interests, s 60b may be decisive. ... it follows that the primary judge could not attach greater weight to the factors referred to in s 60b than she did to the outcome of her s 60cc deliberations. as would be apparent from our summary of the primary judge\u2019s reasons, her honour\u2019s findings made pursuant to s 60cc as to the father\u2019s application to change where the child lives were predominately neutral or weighed heavily against change. they certainly did not culminate in findings that supported a change in where the child lives. against this background, her honour could not permissibly use the provisions in s 60b to order the child lives with the father because, contrary to the application of s 60cc, that outcome would \u201c...better meet the objects and principles in s 60b\u201d [118]. in other words, an order that the child lives with the father had to be driven by the application of s 60cc and not her honour\u2019s mistaken analysis of the role and scope of s 60b. it follows that we are in full agreement with their honours in aldridge v keaton at [49]: ... that no provision was included in the act suggesting greater or lesser weight should be given to any particular applicant. nor do we cavil with the well settled jurisprudence which establishes that in a parenting case undertaken between a parent and another person interested in the welfare of a child, the fact of parenthood requires careful consideration (aldridge v keaton). however, s 60b cannot be used to establish a hierarchy as to outcome in which parents sit at the apex. in our view, it is abundantly clear that the comparative significance for a particular child of the fact of parenthood (which may in an individual case be decisive) is to be considered and weighed along with the other matters identified in s 60cc (and if relevant s 65daa). but not on the basis that the factors referred to in s 60b can be used in favour of a parent to deliver an outcome inconsistent with the proper application of s 60cc. emphasis in bold and italics] ... in this instance, the magistrate\u2019s reasons reveal the appellant\u2019s application was dismissed essentially because the respondents jointly opposed the children spending any time with the appellant. the magistrate considered the respondents were entitled to make that decision as an incident of their parental responsibility for the children and strongly implied the legitimacy of their decision need not be scrutinised, much less countermanded. deciding the dispute in that way improperly elevated the importance of the respondents\u2019 parental authority over, and their responsibility for, the children in a way which was inconsistent with the law, as explained by the full court in maldera v orbel, valentine & lacerra, and aldridge & keaton. the appellant undoubtedly had standing under the act to bring the proceedings (ss 65c(ba) and 69c(2)(c)) and so her application ought have been considered on merit, not dismissed just because the respondents opposed it. ... it seems apparent from the evidence before the magistrate that other factors affecting the children\u2019s best interests were pertinent and ought to have been considered. for example: the parties\u2019 attitudes and their relative capacities to adequately provide for the children\u2019s emotional needs in the midst of their personal conflict (ss 60cc(3)(f) and 60cc(3)(i)), the children are each happy, healthy and making sound academic progress in the respondents\u2019 care despite the appellant\u2019s limited involvement in their lives (s 60cc(3)(m)), and whether the appellant\u2019s forced re-introduction to and continuing engagement with the children is liable to have any deleterious emotional affect upon them (s 60cc(3)(d)). tation omitted] the parties\u2019 cases and evidence ms avonlea\u2019s case and evidence ... the children have a strong and loving relationship with the applicant. this was conceded by the respondents to the family report writer, who notes \u201cit is also evident that [x] and [y] have a positive connection with [ms avonlea]\u201d.4 the applicant provided not insignificant care to the children from a very young age, often in the absence of the respondents. ... section 60(f)(ii) \u2013 the capacity of any other person (including any grandparent or other relative of the child) to provide for the needs of the child, including emotional and intellectual needs. the applicant has previously provided significant care to the children without issue. the supervised report supports the applicant\u2019s assertion that she is attuned to the children\u2019s needs when in her care. by way of example, the supervised report notes that the applicant \u201cwas observed to be focused on the children for the duration of the contact and responsive to their needs.\u201d [footnote omitted] ... \u2022 as noted above, the applicant strongly denies any allegations of family violence, or that she poses any risk of harm to the children. \u2022 these allegations are not supported by the dhhs report and supervised report and are not addressed in the family report of [dr e]. section 60cc(3)(m) \u2013 any other fact or circumstance that the court thinks is relevant. the applicant holds concerns that the respondents will not facilitate any relationship between the children and her in circumstances where no orders for time are made. the respondents have consistently demonstrated a refusal to facilitate the children spending time with the applicant, including supervised time. the applicant has repeatedly expressed her discomfort at the first respondent supervising her time with the children and has sought for alternative arrangements to be put in place. the respondents have consistently refused that any time take place without the first respondent being present. no alternatives have been proposed by the respondents. the respondents have additionally sought to minimise the applicant\u2019s role in the children\u2019s care, by referring to her as a \u2018babysitter\u2019 and a \u2018half-sibling\u2019. the respondents do not acknowledge or demonstrate any appreciation for the significance of the applicant\u2019s role in the children\u2019s lives, or the value of their relationship with her. the applicant contends that the recommendations in the family report have been made on the assumption that the respondents will facilitate time with the children. the applicant asserts that this assumption is incorrect, as demonstrated by the consistent unwillingness of the respondents to co-operate with the applicant\u2019s requests for time. the orders sought by the applicant require the children to spend minimal time in her care. no overnight or time during the school week is sought. the orders proposed will have no impact upon the children\u2019s living arrangements, or their relationships with the respondents, and can flexibly be arranged around the children\u2019s other co-curricular obligations. ms smallwood: so the objects of the act is not a cascading, if you like, formula for children\u2019s welfare that you start with the top, with the parents and then gradually it goes down and, indeed, the point was, in my submission, most unfortunately, made to you, she\u2019s only a half-sister. that submission says it all, really, in terms of, certainly, mr burns\u2019 client, if he was instructed to put that to you, which i\u2019m sure he was. she is not considered to be important in these children\u2019s lives from the viewpoint of their parents and she will not be accommodated if they can possibly avoid it. when i asked [mr daxton] in the witness box who the members of his family were, and i named them all, apart from [ms avonlea], he was keen to tell the court, \u201cand [ms avonlea]\u201d. well, [ms avonlea] is certainly not considered in all of the submissions you\u2019ve heard with respect to the impact on the family unit. that never, ever includes [ms avonlea]. she has been completely ostracised from that family unit, and let\u2019s have a look at why. we\u2019ve heard, basically, what i would describe as an absolute character assassination from two members of counsel, who, of course, are doing their job, but it was an absolute character assassination with my client sitting behind. it would take an enormous amount of courage to sit there and listen to that, but my client did so. she\u2019s extremely upset, of course. who wouldn\u2019t be, listening to themselves described as, let\u2019s face it, a monster. ... ms smallwood: a monster was the level of it, and what particularly monstrous thing she did, the most appalling thing in the world. she doesn\u2019t take drugs, she doesn\u2019t physically hurt anybody, she \u2013 what she did was engage in a dialogue with her, as she generously calls [b], her brother, who, in fact, of course, anyone else in the room would say was not related to her in any way because there\u2019s no genetic connection, but she calls him her brother, just like she calls [y] and [x] her siblings. her brother and sister. she\u2019s alone in that regard, and i submit that tells a story in itself, but what she did was engage with [b] over a period of time with texts in which she was critical of his parents. she\u2019s critical, particularly, of her own father, who is not [b]\u2019s father. he is his stepfather, and she was critical of him, because she saw characteristics of his disciplinary activity with [b] as being reflective of her own experience, and we know about the [m] signs. we know that [mr daxton] engages in very direct, some would say psychologically abusive, forms of bringing a 14-year-old to heel. to put \u2013 he said he hadn\u2019t counted them, but to put signs around the house, it was bizarre and most unpleasant for [b] and reflective of what was going on in that house. nothing to do with my client. where my client comes into play is that [b] talked about it with her and she told him what she thought and that, apparently, makes her into a monster. she told him that she had had unpleasant experiences with her father, and there\u2019s nothing to suggest her evidence about that is not true. [dr e], of course, her take on everybody in the family was my client has got personality problems and, therefore, everybody else has to be protected from her. now, if the family was still together and [ms avonlea] was living in the house, what would the problem be. the problem would be simply conversations occurring between teenagers and older people in the house. others could have their input, and that\u2019s family life. certainly not akin to the character assassination of that monster marauding, waiting. planning, according to mr burns. planning the attack. it\u2019s highly insulting and, in my submission, is completely fanciful. she was simply a sibling, as she perceived it \u2013 she perceives it, and as [b] willingly perceived it. we know that they were close. and she shared \u2013 she says no overshared, of course, but, sure, the content of the texts was highly critical of particularly her father, but that doesn\u2019t make her a bad person and it does not make her a risk and it does not make her somebody who should be banned from all contact with their siblings in case she somehow besmirched the happy family in which they live, which we know is not a happy family, and we know, i suggest, that that\u2019s not just because of [ms avonlea], but they would have you believe that. [ms avonlea] has been targeted as the cause for all problems, keeping in mind, your honour, that the problems that this family has that were constantly mentioned in the proceeding and in the addresses have never been articulated. i don\u2019t know what the problems were and i\u2019ve sat through the trial. it\u2019s all just smoke and mirrors, words, handy phrases, but never do you get down to what particular problem did [ms avonlea] cause, because, in fact, her conversations with [b] \u2013 and i\u2019m not suggesting that they were pleasant to read. i mean, clearly, there is lots of negativity in there. i don\u2019t \u2013 can\u2019t and don\u2019t step away from that, but i do put this submission on behalf of my client that they do not create the profile of a monster who is waiting to destroy a family and circles until she can do so, which is pretty much what my two friends said. the sibling relationships are, of course, very important. they are lifelong. some might even say more important than parental relationships, because they last for longer, because everybody stays alive longer, but they are incredibly important. we see them recognised all the time in this court and we see them as recognised within the family law act. we know from the evidence, apparently, everybody was in agreement when they told [dr e] that the children had a loving, caring and positive relationship with [ms avonlea]. sounds like the usual sibling relationship has been in place. however, discord arises in the family, discord over the disciplinary actions adopted by [mr daxton] towards [b]. basically, that\u2019s pretty much how it started, with the signs. the [m] signs. because, of course, they, to [ms avonlea], on her view of the world, signalled what was going to happen to [b] in terms of his relationship with her father would be very reflective of her similar experience. the discord within the family has caused my \u2013 a falling out between [ms gillies] and my client. most unfortunate, because, of course, [ms gillies] and my client were close, and it\u2019s not a matter of \u2013 as has been put to you \u2013 [ms gillies] took [ms avonlea] into her family. once again, that says a mouthful. [ms avonlea] was part of that family. nobody took her into it. she was part of it and she has been excised from it and, in my submission, to the detriment of [x] and [y]. ... ms smallwood: ... exclude herself? she continually \u2013 and the affidavits show, she continually texted her father asking for some kind of counselling to take place for reconciliation. they could not agree on the form that should take. that doesn\u2019t mean she excluded herself from the family. that means that they were at loggerheads about how that could occur, but it certainly does not mean she excluded herself from the family, keeping in mind this whole case is about [ms gillies] and [mr daxton] being in control of the family, that they should be unassailed, that it is a family unit and my client is circling, trying to break it up. that\u2019s how the case is put. so to suggest that she has excised herself from the family, when, basically, the wagons are circling with respect to the family as far as [mr daxton] and [ms gillies] are concerned is, in my submission, completely unsustainable. she has a conversation with [ms gillies] over the phone, in which she says, well, when [ms gillies] is telling her about problems with respect to interplay in the family and disciplinary actions and so forth, [ms avonlea] says, \u201cit sounds like dad\u2019s doing the same thing\u201d. that was untenable. absolutely could not be tolerated. things went on for a while, but, as [ms gillies] said, she was strained. his honour: well, is it dad\u2019s doing the same thing, was that untenable, or was [ms gillies]\u2019 position of, \u201cwe\u2019re going to have to disagree about that\u201d, untenable to [ms avonlea]? that\u2019s - - - ms smallwood: well - - - his honour: that\u2019s one of the factual disputes, isn\u2019t it? ms smallwood: it is, and you would have to believe \u2013 that\u2019s a credit issue to a large degree, and [ms gillies] gave evidence that after that phone call there was a degree of coolness, separation, withdrawal \u2013 i can\u2019t remember the exact words she used, your honour, but that my client was less engaged with her, i think, would be a fair way of recalling what she said. i know that\u2019s not her words. his honour: i\u2019m not sure it\u2019s \u2013 i will look carefully at whether it\u2019s a credit issue or whether it\u2019s an issue of the parties\u2019 perceptions. they disagreed, but it doesn\u2019t mean that one or both are lying or exaggerating. ms smallwood: it doesn\u2019t, but my client\u2019s evidence is that [ms gillies] screamed at her. his honour: yes. and [ms gillies] says she screamed at her on - - - ms smallwood: yes. his honour: - - - [mid-2023] and [ms avonlea] says [ms gillies] screamed at her and neither parties affidavit of evidence-in-chief acknowledges the other one screaming. ... ms smallwood: and for the purpose of your decision, why does it even matter. why does it matter. why does all of this matter. what matters to your honour only and solely is the welfare of [x] and [y]. you\u2019re told, \u201cif my client gets time with the children, that will be upsetting for [mr daxton] and [ms gillies] and it will affect the family unit\u201d, once again, excluding my client, although, of course, she has excluded herself according to them. it will upset the family unit. that\u2019s not a matter that your honour is asked to determine as to whether it upsets somebody else or not. your honour is fair and square required to focus upon the welfare of [x] and [y]. we know [ms gillies] is patently emotionally dysregulated, and that was \u2013 that phrase was accepted by [dr e] as her presentation when she went to see her. whilst you\u2019re told constantly that, well, it\u2019s [ms avonlea]\u2019s fault that that happened. what [ms avonlea] did. what exactly did [ms avonlea] do, as we get back to it, the [b] incident was all [ms avonlea] did. okay. i accept that it is extreme, in texting between the two siblings, but it\u2019s not as if [ms avonlea] was doing anything else. she was, in her evidence, supporting [b] when he was having difficulties at home. now, he was having difficulties at home. that wasn\u2019t [ms avonlea]\u2019s fault. he was having difficulties at home, but that has now all been piled on [ms avonlea]. he was only having difficulties at home because she was supporting him. she was telling him, \u201cdon\u2019t listen to your father\u201d, effectively, because, \u201ci know what he\u2019s like\u201d. her evidence is that [b] was saying he felt like killing himself. she did the right thing. she encouraged him to go to the school counsellor, which he did, for which she is criticised and she went \u2013 he went to the school counsellor, she didn\u2019t, and the school counsellor and he worked out a safety plan, and guess who the safety plan was directed at protecting him from? [mr daxton]. so it\u2019s not what it seems on the surface, perfect family, terrific, wolf circling trying to destroy, which is what my friends would have you believe. there was trouble in paradise within that family, that\u2019s for sure. we know that from the [m] signs and we know that from what [b] told the counsellor at the school and the safety plan which was devised, which had my client as a contact for a safe place, as well as others, and, of course, pointedly, not his parents. my client was chipped on that, 45 \u201cdon\u2019t you think they should have been the persons on the safety plan?\u201d in my submission, absolutely absurd. why would they be? they were the people that [b] was describing as feeling unsafe with. so the good part of the story is, if we can believe, that [b] now is doing well. good. but we now see, also, when he goes to [dr e] that he\u2019s looking forward to making contact with [ms avonlea] again. he wants to see her again, because he has a good relationship with her and wants to see her again. we don\u2019t know how that will go, in terms of whether he will be permitted or not, but that\u2019s not important for your honour to consider. what your honour needs to consider is his comments to [dr e]. he says now, \u201cthings are going better that she\u2019s out of my ear and so forth and so on\u201d. okay. once again, can\u2019t step away from those comments. that\u2019s what he said, but it is not of a level of evil and psychotic behaviour which is being urged upon you, of which there is not one smidgeon of evidence, apart from the fact that my client attends a psychologist. well, she can take a number on that. every single person in this case, apart from [x] and [y], attends a psychologist. \u2018 his honour: witnesses. witnesses and parties. ms smallwood: yes. okay. it took me a while to get that, your honour, but i get it. yes. witnesses and parties. yes. so, in my submission, there\u2019s this swirling implication all this terrible stuff has been caused by [ms avonlea]. what, exactly? they didn\u2019t even know about her exchanges with [b] until 2022 and there had been trouble going on for a year prior to that, but that\u2019s shafted on [ms avonlea] now. \u201cif she hadn\u2019t been doing that, [b] would have been more easily able to control [b]\u201d. [b], who is the subject of litigation in this court and has been, according to his mother in the witness box, for many, many, many years, and we now know from [ms gillies] evidence in the witness box, as she said, 15 years of family abuse she has suffered. well, [b] is 15. i assume that means from the day he was born. there have been orders made in this court. yes. now, that\u2019s of interest. orders were made in this court for [b] to see his father, and [ms gillies]\u2019 complaint was they constituted emotional abuse, he was psychologically and emotionally abused, and, \u201ci have put up with this for 15 years\u201d, and, \u201ci\u2019m basically at the end of my tether because of it\u201d. well, the court, clearly, formed the view that [b] should see his father and made orders to that effect, but [ms gillies] certainly didn\u2019t accept them, and she has been engaged, we gather \u2013 we don\u2019t know the exact details, but from what she said yesterday she has been engaged in a constant fight to try and stop the application of those orders, and that is why she does not want orders to be made in this case, because, as she said, she would have to comply with them. yes. that\u2019s the purpose of orders. orders are made because people \u2013 people come to this court because they can\u2019t figure it out themselves. there\u2019s absolutely no point, with the greatest respect to [dr e], saying, \u201cwell, don\u2019t make any orders, because they should be able to figure it out themselves. there are other things they can do. they can go to therapy\u201d. this court exists because people can\u2019t sort things out for themselves and orders are made in order to ensure children receive the best possible chance at life with welfare, happiness and the like. and that\u2019s what my client is here to endeavour to establish that [x] and [y] have the opportunity to have a fruitful, loving, caring and positive relationship with her for the rest of their lives, and both parents are here saying, \u201cno, don\u2019t make an order. it\u2019s her fault. she could come to the house if she wants to whilst her father is there\u201d. they know that there is absolute \u2013 animosity is probably the wrong word to use, because it\u2019s a bit too active, but absolute antithesis of seeing the world in a harmonious fashion between [ms avonlea] and her father and it is not a new thing. it has been going on since 2008 when [ms avonlea] first saw a psychologist. her father went along, but her father was quick to point out to your honour it was nothing to do with him. it was because she was having trouble adjusting to his separation from her mother. when [mr daxton] gave evidence there was nothing, never once did he ever acknowledge that anything about himself could have contributed in any way to his poor relationship with his own daughter. it was all, \u201c[ms avonlea] is \u2013 has mental health issues. so wipe her off, in case she infects the other children\u201d, but, strangely enough, everybody in that household is struggling with mental health issues. that is the one constant in that particular family structure, and that is not because of my client. also [ms gillies] conflated, i would suggest to your honour, unfortunately, her experience with [b]\u2019s father, [mr d], with her experience in these proceedings. they are not the same thing. she has, as she said, 15 years of family violence, 15 years of coercive control, of psychological and emotional abuse. they have been visited \u2013 that concept has been visited upon [ms avonlea] and she sees [ms avonlea] through the prism of her, what she describes as, lived experience, and that is not [ms avonlea]\u2019s fault. she admitted she was hypervigilant, but only because \u2013 when it came to the safety of the children, i would submit, she has a distorted view of the danger [ms avonlea] places, and that distorted view is as a result of her own psychological difficulties, for which \u2013 were patently evident, i would submit, in the court. she couldn\u2019t even bear to sit in the room whilst my client gave evidence and in the witness box her demeanour, her expressions, the manner in which she approached the giving of evidence, she is a person who is emotionally dysregulated and appears to require assistance. she herself says she can\u2019t work. her psychiatric state \u2013 psychological state, i should say, is such to prevent her from working. she clearly needs assistance, and that is not my client\u2019 fault, but that is the reason why she sees my client, in my submission, with such fear or resentment or as some sort of threat. there is no evidence, i would suggest to you, as to how, if your honour makes the orders, they would deleteriously affect [ms gillies]\u2019 parenting or [mr daxton]\u2019s parenting of [x] and [y]. once again, that\u2019s a phrase that has just been thrown around liberally as a concept. that\u2019s exactly what it is. it\u2019s a concept. there is not a shred of evidence to that effect. not one. not one shred. if that was the case, if \u2013 let\u2019s just stand and pretend for a moment that this is a conflict between parents, which we see all the time in these courts, it would be unthinkable that a parent came along and, on the basis that, \u201cno, there can\u2019t be any contact because i will be psychologically devastated if there is\u201d, without producing expert evidence to that effect. of course they would produce expert evidence or they wouldn\u2019t win, but here there\u2019s a kind of claytons sense of what\u2019s to be determined, and i will be urging your honour to not be lulled into a sense of, if you like, less rigorous an application of the principles. there is no evidence whatsoever of any potential impact to [ms gillies]\u2019 psychological functioning or of [mr daxton] in terms of it affecting their parenting. 5 only their say so, and if they can say that, then they can do something about it and get treatment to address that particular vulnerability which they have, not my client. we have also the generalised statements coming thick and fast about the effect on the family, the effect on the family. last \u2013 in the future, in the past. what, exactly? there has been turmoil in the courtroom, that\u2019s for sure, but we have no evidence of what actually was deleterious in the family at all. it\u2019s just a \u2013 what it boils down to is my client exchanged those text dialogues with [b] over a long period of time. they were discovered a year after they had taken place and everything was retrospectively visited upon them. \u201cthat\u2019s why we\u2019ve been having trouble with [b], but we don\u2019t know what the trouble was, because we never descended to those details. that\u2019s why things haven\u2019t been great\u201d, but no details were descended to. from [b]\u2019s point of view, he gets [m] signs put up because he forgot to put a glass of milk in the dishwasher. that\u2019s what he says. and we know [mr daxton] says he didn\u2019t do anything wrong, so to visit the turmoil on my client retrospectively because she has engaged in conversation with [b] about how he was feeling and how desperate he was feeling and the fact that she directed him to health, rather than ignored him, she is now described as a monster, but, once again, without any real details as to exactly what this terrible, terrible result was, because we come here today with the evidence being everything is fine in the family and that\u2019s what we should be preserving. we shouldn\u2019t let [ms avonlea] wreck that. so what, exactly, was the damage? of course, [mr daxton] didn\u2019t like reading what he read and, of course, [ms gillies] found it upsetting, as well. yes. of course. my client realises now that wasn\u2019t such a great thing to do and that she \u2013 she says she wouldn\u2019t do it again and, i would submit, there\u2019s nothing for your honour to suggest that she\u2019s lying about that, and i would say the demeanour of my witness in the \u2013 my client in the witness box, your honour, she is a young woman of intelligence. she is a young woman of \u2013 with goals. she is a young woman engaged in both work to support herself and study to further her future interests. she is not the person which we heard spoken of earlier at all. [dr e] does these tests in \u2013 well, she has got this, \u201cthis is what her personality is like\u201d. okay. well, that\u2019s not a crime. everybody has got a different personality. it\u2019s not as if her personality shows she\u2019s a serial killer or she\u2019s likely to suicide or she\u2019s likely to harm others. no. 40 she\u2019s just likely to be a bit bumpy to get along with, and that is not a reason to exclude [y] and [x]. bumpy to get along with, if you don\u2019t agree with her or if she has a different view. well, in my submission, it\u2019s a radical step to take to ban somebody because their 45 personality might be a bit scratchy from having a relationship with their siblings, because the scratchiness becomes irritating, particularly for [mr daxton], her own father. life is easier for him without her and that\u2019s what will happen if and when your honour doesn\u2019t make orders in this regard, as she seeks. ... ms smallwood: the extremity of the reaction to my client\u2019s engagement with [b], in my submission, that in itself is a problem and it\u2019s not [ms avonlea]\u2019s problem. it\u2019s the problem of those that have engaged in the extremity of that action. when asked the events leading up to [ms gillies] blocking my client on her phone, we had heard about how there was consistent phone calls and she had to block \u2013 when it came down to it, one hour on one occasion and she blocked her and that has remained so. so everybody in this particular scenario, in my submission, overreacts, and that is something that they all need to look at if they want to get along harmoniously, but that\u2019s a matter for them. all your honour has to concentrate on is the welfare of [x] and [y] and the loss and, i would say, the certainly loss if no orders are made of their relationship with their sibling, [ms avonlea], because it is a fantasy, in my submission, to suggest that time will be facilitated in the future unless it is required by order, and we have [ms gillies]\u2019 evidence on that herself, \u201cit\u2019s an order. i have to comply with it\u201d. that\u2019s right, because otherwise there won\u2019t be time. and for [mr daxton] to say \u2013 [dr e] considered it to be genuine, but i would submit it is not a genuine wish for harmony for him to say, \u201ci want to be there\u201d. that\u2019s simply as a watchdog. it is not an harmonious situation. it is not a natural situation for little children to spend with their siblings. it\u2019s a matter of trust. i get that. i completely understand that the case is that they don\u2019t trust [ms avonlea] any more, but, really, there has been, as i say, that one dialogue with [b] behind their back. that\u2019s why they don\u2019t trust her, because they didn\u2019t know it was going on. ... ms smallwood: and it\u2019s not as if there\u2019s a happy little family, brady bunch all living together, melded family and there is this threat. it is not that simple at all and my client has been, if you like, profiled as the cause of all problems. nothing could be further from the truth. she is part of a series of problems in that family and she has been, like everybody else in that family, presumably, to a degree, a victim of problems within the family, but, in my submission, it is completely incorrect to profile her as the problem personified when she\u2019s not. she did something that she now regrets. now we\u2019re here, of course, she regrets it, but which \u2013 engaging in dialogue with [b], which was denigratory of her father and [ms gillies], insofar as their parenting went. as she said, \u201ci didn\u2019t denigrate them. i denigrated their parenting\u201d, but that might be semantics, but nevertheless it is true and, in that situation, this has erupted to a degree where she is now portrayed as a threat. a psychological danger to all within the family structure apart from herself. so she must be excised and no orders made and i would submit to your honour that that deprives [x] and [y] of their right pursuant to the purpose of the act, their right to have a relationship with their sibling which couldn\u2019t \u2013 can be of a lifelong quality and, if you look at my client in the witness box, that relationship, in my submission, would be extremely fruitful and extremely beneficial to them. that\u2019s all i have to say, your honour. ... incident of [mid-]2023 as far as i am aware, the conflict between dad, [ms gillies] and myself arose following the below incident. prior to this event, the children would regularly spend time in my unsupervised care, and we enjoyed a normal relationship. [in mid-]2022, i received a message from [b] that said words to the effect of \"[mr daxton]\u2019s gone psycho\". i was concerned by this message and wanted to check that [b] was ok, as i knew that he had a difficult relationship with dad. when i spoke to [b], he informed me that a number of paper signs with the word '[m]\u2019 has been placed around dad and [ms gillies]\u2019 home. as i had already organised to care for the children [in mid-]2022, i decided that it would be more appropriate to speak to dad and [ms gillies] about this issue on that date, so that we could discuss the matter in person. when i arrived at dad and [ms gillies]\u2019 home [in mid-]2022, they were both present. they left the home approximately 10 minutes after i arrived. ... after arriving, i discovered approximately 25 paper signs around the house. these all read '[m]'. a further 15 or so signs had been printed but were left in a pile on the floor. when i spoke to [b] about the signs, he told me that they were put up around the house after he forgot to put a glass in the dishwasher. [b] told me that he found the signs distressing. when he discussed the signs with me, i observed [b] to be very upset about them. ... dad and [ms gillies] returned home at approximately 11 :30 pm. i understand that they had been at a dinner, and i observed them to be slightly intoxicated by the time that they returned. i asked dad and [ms gillies] about the signs, and attempted to raise my concerns given my conversation with [b]. in response, [ms gillies] became very defensive, and started yelling at me words to the effect of \"you don't have to like it, this is our choice\" and \"this is how we've chosen to parent\". i attempted to explain how [b] had expressed to me that he found the signs intimidating, and that it was hurtful for him to see them when he woke up. in response, [ms gillies] continued to yell at me, and repeated words to the effect of ''you have to accept and respect\" the decision. i recall saying words to the effect of \"it's disgusting that you're letting my dad treat [b] this way\". although i did not agree with the comments made by [ms gillies], i acknowledge that my response was not appropriate in the circumstances. after this, [ms gillies] refused to participate in any further discussions with me. after [ms gillies] left the room, i had a brief conversation with dad, where he indicated that i had only heard [b]\u2019s position and had not considered other factors. i reiterated that i thought the signs were hurtful, and would cause more harm to [b] than good. we didn't agree on this point, and so i decided to leave. i left the house ... without any further incident at approximately 12:30 pm. after this event, dad has insisted that he supervise any interactions i have with the children, notwithstanding the extensive amount of time i previously spent caring for the children alone. when i first attempted to bring up this conversation with dad, he sent me a message stating \"i forgive you\". i recall finding this response very disappointing, as it suggested to me that dad did not accept any responsibility for his role in the conflict. following this date, dad and [ms gillies] have limited my ability to spend any unsupervised time with the children. i did not spend any face-to-face time with the children until supervised time was ordered following the interim defended hearing in june 2023. ... ... prior to the [m] sign incident prior to the incident above, i had a very close relationship with the children. i have been intimately involved in their care and development since they were born and have consequently developed strong bonds with them. ... ... i would often care for the children when dad and [ms gillies] were not available. dad and [ms gillies] frequently encouraged me to spend time with the children without their supervision. ... i recall dad and [ms gillies] often expressing their appreciation for the time that i spent with the children, acknowledging the closeness of the relationship that we shared. ... ... following the interim defended hearing in this matter, i have noticed that the children have become more ambivalent to engage in facetime calls with me. ... often, these calls were only ended when dad told the children that they had to have a bath or get ready for bed. i do not recall the children otherwise being happy or willing to end the facetime calls with me. following the interim defended hearing, however, this has noticeably changed. i have observed that during our facetime calls, the children have become more reluctant to talk openly with me. they have also appeared distracted and have indicated that they want to end the calls early. ... ... i am concerned that the children are being encouraged not to participate in these facetime sessions. as this is one of the only ways that i can communicate with the children, i am worried that our relationship will be compromised as a result of this influence. ... prior to these proceedings, i regularly communicated with [b]. i consider [b] to be my brother. we were very close and would often discuss normal sibling matters in person or via electronic platforms. [b] would usually message me about matters that he was uncomfortable speaking about with [ms gillies] and dad. [b] confided in me, and we shared a significant level of trust between us.[4] ... [b] would often send messages that were personal, and that he did not want me to share. i respected his request in this regard and did not share these messages with dad and [ms gillies]. however, if [b] sent messages that concerned me, i would encourage him to express his feelings, or to reach out to his counsellor. i was aware that [b] had a difficult relationship with his father, and wanted to ensure he felt protected when talking about these kind of issues. ... later on the same date [late] 2022], i received a message from [b] which stated: \"im sorry i need a break from you right now, i won't be responding for a while. it's not that i don't love you. but i need a break [sic].\" ... this incident made me acutely aware that [b] was being involved by dad and [ms gillies] in our dispute. in order to protect [b] from being further involved, i have respected his request that i no longer contact him. subsequent to the message sent by [b] above, i have not had any further contact with him, save for a few minor messages, for instance, wishing him happy birthday. my relationship with dad has been strained for a number of years. following my parents' separation, my dad and i have experienced various levels of conflict. in my experience, dad can be a highly combative and controlling individual, who struggles to deal with people who do not accept or share his opinions. i often find him to be a very intimidating person, especially when he is angry or frustrated. in order to address this conflict, i have attended upon a psychologist for a number of years for ongoing support. dad is aware of this, however, has not been supportive of my attendance, particularly if my appointments conflicted with other plans that he had made. i recall that on one occasion in 2018, dad sought for me to cancel my psychologist appointments so that he could go to the beach. notwithstanding the above, i have found that following the children's birth, dad and i have been able to maintain a co-operative relationship. we would often communicate via text message, with dad sharing anecdotes about the children, and checking in with regards to my day to day life. by way of example, i celebrated with dad and [ms gillies] as a family at their wedding in 2022. we would occasionally holiday together, and share other events as a family unit including the children and [b]. as i had a strong relationship with the children, and were actively involved in their life, dad and i were able to make arrangements and spend time together without issue. i am acutely aware of the harm that disputing parents can have on a child, having experienced it in the way my dad's relationship with my mum deteriorated following their separation. given this awareness, i have always attempted to take the 'high road' and remain civil with dad to protect the children. by contrast, prior to these proceedings, i had a positive relationship with [ms gillies]. i considered us to be close friends , and valued her opinion in the same way i would an older sister. i felt comfortable confiding in [ms gillies] with regards to my worries, and appreciated the advice that she would give me. in particular, we would often exchange messages about the children, which i enjoyed. ... ... although it will take time, i acknowledge there is potential that the relationship between me, dad and [ms gillies] can be repaired. i have previously suggested that we attend family therapy and am open to taking this step sometime in the future for the benefit of the children. ... in circumstances where dad and [ms gillies] have made it increasingly difficult to spend time with the children, i do not accept the recommendations of the family report. in my experience, the conduct of dad and [ms gillies] when attempting to organise my time with the children has indicated that they do not place any value on the children's relationship with me and will not facilitate any time between me and the children in the absence of court orders. ... given the history of our matter, and dad and [ms gillies]\u2019 persistent refusal to recognise the value of my relationship with the children, i am deeply concerned that if no orders are made my relationship with the children will be irretrievably damaged. i am their older sister, and have a relationship that is different to that of their parents. i have been intimately involved in their care since they were very young and have shared many special memories with them during that time. ... the supervisor\u2019s evidence although initially a little bit uncertain, the children were observed to quickly engage in mutual play with one another and [ms avonlea], such as using the bouncing pit and climbing wall area... wow the majority of the contact was spent in play, the writer also observed quieter portions wherein [ms avonlea] and the children were observed to be able to converse [with] one another and [about] normal topics (such as what the children had been doing at school). activities in general (after the initial meeting of [ms avonlea] and the children) were noted as seeming overall to be mutually engaged and generally positive in nature, with all seeming to enjoy their time. ... despite some initial uncertainty/unease (mainly from the children), both were observed to quickly settle and relax, presenting as enjoying their time while on the contact. avonlea] was noted being able to parent/care for the children without clear issue. examples/exceptions below:- [ms avonlea] was noted as highly organised for the contact. this included varied food for the children such as fruit bowls and berries. some junk food was present, however [ms avonlea] was observed to only allow the children to have a limited amount (but being able to pick from a large selection \u2013 the children chose [muesli bars]). [ms avonlea] also brought filled water bottles for the children. the children also brought their own water bottles. [ms avonlea] was noted as generally able to direct/provide direction for the children without clear issue, such as keeping them on time for the [tour], and directing them where they needed to be/go. [ms avonlea] was also observed to remind the children to eat/drink if they needed to. [y] was noted as quite receptive to these instructions and to listen well. [x] generally listened, although he was noted as having trouble concentrating at times. [x] was also observed to seem to need strong/consistent stimulation, and if this did not occur (such as when waiting in line for the [tour] to begin), he could at times begin to annoy [y] or self-stimulate (such as tyring to climb a statue). when this occurred, [ms avonlea] seemed calm, correcting the behaviour such as saying \u201cdon\u2019t hit please\u201d (when he began to slap [y]\u2019s map). [x] usually did as asked, although needing a few prompts at times. [ms avonlea] was noted as seeming positive towards the children for the duration of the contact and generally pleased to be with them. [ms avonlea] for instance was observed to call the children pet names such as \u201choney\u201d in what seemed an affectionate manner. [ms avonlea] was observed to be strongly focused on the children for the duration of the contact and to keep a good eye on them, generally aware of where they were at al times. [ms avonlea] did not need prompt to behave in this manner. [ms avonlea] was noted as quickly noticing that [x] had a scratch on his neck, asking him how he got this. [x] said he received this playing with [y] (or words to this effect). ... both children were initially a little bit quiet, but otherwise settled. both children quickly settled during the first few minutes, being observed to chat with [ms avonlea] while in line to get their tickets. while in line, both children were observed to lean on [ms avonlea] without prompt. ... [ms avonlea] and the children were observed to be focused on one another and not the writer. both children were observed to direct their queries and engagement(s) towards [ms avonlea] (barring some infrequent interaction with the writer). both children and [ms avonlea] behaved in this manner with no need for prompt. ... [ms avonlea] was observed to be physically affectionate with/towards both children, such as rubbing each on the neck and head. [ms avonlea] and the children presented as at ease with this contact. [x] was observed to be desiring of physical contact with [ms avonlea], such as sitting on her lap without prompt at the caf\u00e9. ... although both children seemed a bit quiet during the initial minutes of the contact (mainly [x]), they were both observed to relax quite quickly and become talkative/animated once settled. both children were observed to seek out assistance and engagement with/from [ms avonlea], and not the writer. for instance, [y] calling out to [ms avonlea], saying \u201c[ms avonlea], come over here!\u201d as an invitation for [ms avonlea] to climb with her (which [ms avonlea] did). both children showed no clear issue with either close physical proximity or physical contact with/from [ms avonlea]. for instance, [x] was observed to ask for [ms avonlea] to push him while on the swing. he was also observed to sit on [ms avonlea]\u2019s lap without prompt when taking a break from playing. another example is both children leaning on [ms avonlea] while they looked at a video on her phone together. ... the writer has noted/seen no issues of significant concern relating to [ms avonlea], whether safety or otherwise. mr daxton\u2019s case and evidence mr combes: thank you, your honour. as your honour has pointed out, there\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a difficult decision, in that the children are going to lose, or the family unit are going to lose. what i would say in relation to the past is the behaviour of [ms avonlea] can only be put as appalling in relation to her treatment of [b], but it goes further than just the treatment of [b], because it had an effect on, clearly, the whole family. it\u2019s almost as if she set out to isolate the family from family and friends. ... ... mr combes: ... the difficulty with this case, i \u2013 as far as that behaviour is concerned, your honour, is that there is not one jot of evidence that anything has changed other than [ms avonlea] saying she regrets or she wouldn\u2019t do it again. there is nothing to suggest that she has actually had a change of mind and, certainly, it was open to her on the basis that she has been seeing a psychologist since, i think, 2018 to get some evidence from him or her as to her current psychological state. she wasn\u2019t asked about whether or not she showed the family report to her psychologist, so we don\u2019t have any evidence of that, but one would assume that she certainly should have. ... mr combes: ... the problem as far as her position is concerned is that her evidence was that she only did it to help [b], that she had no intention of doing harm, and that in itself creates a problem, because, clearly, she has no insight whatsoever into what she was doing, and that raises, then, the problem that if she has time with the younger children there is nothing to suggest that if there are problems in the home, she wouldn\u2019t behave in exactly the same way. [dr e] mentioned that she didn\u2019t have any major mental symptoms, but she goes into some detail as to her psychological problems and, as i indicated to your honour, there is nothing to suggest that they have been in any way ameliorated, and it was open to her [[ms avonlea]] to do that. ... his honour: can i just say, mr combes, i\u2019m not going to infer that because someone sees a psychologist they have problems, in inverted commas. mr combes: no, of course, but i think the \u2013 [dr e] indicated that there were psychological problems. the one and only question, your honour, is whether or not there\u2019s more harm in the children not seeing their sister or there\u2019s more harm in not seeing her \u2013 or having time with their sister and the effects that that will have on her family and that is the sole question that, really, has to be answered, and your honour has an abundance of evidence that the effect of the 12, 18 months has had a massive effect on this family. and not just on [b] or not just on [ms gillies] or my client, but on the younger children, too, and it has slowed down, because the parents were having difficulties as a result of her actions, the children were having difficulties. they were showing signs of some distress, and the difficulty, as far as [ms avonlea] is concerned, your honour, is that other than her word that she has changed or that she wouldn\u2019t do it again, there is nothing to suggest that it can\u2019t happen again. and, in fact, if one reads the report of the \u2013 [dr e], it\u2019s likely to happen again. the other very salient matter, your honour, is the fact that if there were orders, they in themselves are going to have an effect on the family, and your honour has seen the distress of both the husband and the wife in these proceedings and you\u2019ve heard about the distress that they\u2019ve suffered over the last 12 or 18 months and, once again, that\u2019s going to affect the welfare of these children. so it\u2019s my submission, your honour, that the better of two evils is for there to be no time spent between the children and [ms avonlea]. it\u2019s, obviously, agreed that there\u2019s no supervised time, and i would submit that any facetime is also inappropriate. your honour, there is just too much of a danger that [ms avonlea] will at some point adopt the same methods with the two younger children. we heard that [b] was a vulnerable child and she used that to the full extent, exemplified by the questions your honour put to the \u2013 [dr e] in relation to her anger at him for not contacting her. she said many times that she has learnt her lesson. there\u2019s no evidence that she has. so, your honour, the only course i would submit that\u2019s appropriate to safeguard this whole family is for her to not have any contact whatsoever with the children. your honour has heard from my client and - - - his honour: are you saying if the application is dismissed, the consequence is there won\u2019t be any time? mr combes: no, because it\u2019s a matter for \u2013 and i\u2019m just coming to that. it\u2019s a matter for [ms avonlea]. my client has accepted all along that he would attend therapeutic counselling without condition. the only reason that i would submit that it hasn\u2019t taken place is that [ms avonlea] imposes conditions on it that are just unrealistic. it seems that, in fact, she\u2019s not saying, \u201ci want therapeutic counselling to fix the relationship between myself and my father\u201d. she\u2019s saying, \u201ci want some sort of mediation\u201d, and in relation to that matter, your honour, i would say that it\u2019s not appropriate to order therapeutic counselling. these people have got to make their minds up to attend and attempt to remedy their relationship. i was going to go through the ills and misdemeanours of [ms avonlea] and \u2013 but your honour is well aware of them. i can only say that my client and his wife have gone through hell over the last 18 months as a result of [ms avonlea]. your honour heard evidence from [ms gillies] yesterday that she overcame, with the support of her husband, the trials that she went through with [b]\u2019s father, and it was the problems that were caused by [ms avonlea] that has brought her to the edge of sanity, and your honour would be well aware that the emotional stability of the parents is going to affect the safety and welfare of the children, and there is overwhelming evidence that if any orders are made, that stability will be put at risk. ms gillies\u2019s case and evidence ... i currently do not feel safe or comfortable talking to or being present in close proximity to [ms avonlea]. i have considered as to whether i would be able to supervise any time between [ms avonlea] and the children, however, i have anxiety just thinking about it, let alone being able to sustain being in [ms avonlea]\u2019s presence for a period of time. it is not suitable for my mental health and wellbeing to be in the proximity of [ms avonlea]. i don\u2019t know that i will ever be able to trust [ms avonlea] again after everything she has done. ... [mr daxton] and i have exercised our parental judgment and acted protectively of our children by not allowing [ms avonlea] to have unsupervised time with [x] and [y] due to our shared concerns for [ms avonlea]\u2019s mental health, her escalating emotionally and psychologically abusive behaviour towards us and our family unit, including evidence of online communication and coercive controlling behaviour involving [b], and written evidence of [ms avonlea]\u2019s intent to alienate and encourage our children to turn against us and to live with her (particularly [y]). we are concerned that if [ms avonlea] is provided unsupervised access to [x] and [y], [ms avonlea] will expose her negative views of [mr daxton] and i to the children, as she has done with [b], and try to justify her choices to the children. as already evidenced through [ms avonlea]\u2019s boundaryless and destructive behaviour to our family unit, we fear [ms avonlea] is incapable of quarantining her feelings from the children. we have observed that [ms avonlea] has quite poor mental health, high levels of anxiety, low levels of selfesteem and difficulties in relationships. we believe these proceedings are driven by [ms avonlea]\u2019s issues and unresolved relationship difficulties with her father with no consideration for her sibling\u2019s wellbeing. i am acutely aware of the impact of ongoing proceedings on the children. i am deeply concerned if there is unsupervised contact between [ms avonlea] and the children it will likely have a significant and detrimental impact on my parenting capacity and my relationship with [mr daxton]. i am exhausted and struggling to cope due to my history of family violence and repeat trauma by ongoing proceedings and these proceedings have already had an impact on my emotional ability to be available to our children and my husband. i have been on stress leave from work since [mid]-2023 and now medicated with anti-depressants and sleeping tablets due to the repeat trauma and concurrent court proceedings for all three of my children: and ramifications of this dispute on me personally and my family unit. as already demonstrated, we will continue to facilitate this relationship between [ms avonlea] and the children in a safe way, without the need for orders. realistically, [ms avonlea] needs to be willing to engage with [mr daxton] in family therapy to try to heal and repair their relationship. mr burns: thank you, your honour. my client took [ms avonlea] into her family, and her evidence is clear from [ms avonlea]\u2019s own evidence she became a confidante, she treated her as a daughter and in the middle of other complications she was having with the former partner and that breakdown, [ms avonlea] totally betrayed her. i would submit that the reason \u2013 the underlying reason of [ms avonlea]\u2019s behaviour was to get anybody she could to assist her in her fight against her father. it wasn\u2019t just a brief spat. there was a contained and controlled program over some considerable time that was calculated, it was with malice against her father. everything she did was premeditated. no concern at all for any collateral damage that she might have caused to other people around and, i submit, that to date in ... her own evidence, there\u2019s very little to suggest that she really does have a concern for that. she says she won\u2019t do the things again, ... she says she regrets it, but i haven\u2019t heard in her evidence, unless i was sleeping or deaf at the time, any suggestion of apology, any suggestion that she understands the harm she has caused to both my client and the father. she has removed my client from the position of loving and trust to someone who has totally \u2013 who was totally betrayed and cannot understand how [ms avonlea] could have done what she did. how [ms avonlea] could try to use her and her son as a wedge to separate her from her husband \u2013 now husband. i submit that [ms avonlea]\u2019s behaviour ... with [b] was pure grooming. it was a program, not necessarily designed, but a program ... with an outcome ... desired to punish her father. for what? her own evidence in the witness box was, \u201che didn\u2019t talk to me\u201d. very little evidence about any harm that was done to her by her father to support her reaction in this way. it\u2019s not as if she was a child. this sort of behaviour one might expect with a petulant 13-year-old. we\u2019ve got an 18-year-old person[5] here who has taken it on herself to become a parent, or behaved like a parent, on behalf of two children \u2013 three children in this case, that her opinion is better than the parents\u2019 opinion on how these children should be treated. no regard at all for the children\u2019s parent belief on how they should manage their children. \u201cmy way is the best way\u201d, was [ms avonlea]\u2019s view, and i submit it still is. so as far as my client goes, and you\u2019ve seen her in the witness box, you\u2019ve seen her outside the witness box, she feels she has been completely betrayed, and that sense of betrayal cannot be overcome overnight, but as long as [ms avonlea] is involved with her children, that fear is going to be there for some time, and you\u2019ve heard the report writer say the danger of that sort of emotional distress could have on the \u2013 not only just on the children, but the whole family unit. there\u2019s evidence already that the distress caused by these events led to the father moving out for a while. that doesn\u2019t \u2013 there\u2019s not one word from [ms avonlea] about any concern that she had for that happening: not her problem. she may have caused the problem, but, \u201ci\u2019m not there to apologise to them. i regret what i did, but i haven\u2019t really thought much about what i did to these people...\u201d. and i echo what my learned friend for the father says, that [ms avonlea] has failed to demonstrate to an acceptable degree, that she has learned. it\u2019s my submission what you heard from her is nothing more than lip service. the thing she had to say, because she knew if she said what she thought, then this case will not go in her favour at all. the family report is unequivocal. the recommendation is that the parents should be allowed to parent their own children. [ms avonlea] is not a parent. she is not a child. she\u2019s not my client\u2019s child, but she does have this relationship, and she says she\u2019s entitled to a much better relationship with the two younger children. but she \u2013 and i\u2019m not trying to minimise this, but she\u2019s a half-sibling. she should be able to see some time, ... my client would not stop [ms avonlea] coming to spend time with the children with [their] father there. it\u2019s [ms avonlea] saying, \u201cno, i\u2019m not going, because of dad\u201d. it\u2019s [ms avonlea] who\u2019s, basically, rather than try it out, has put the parents through the trauma of having to come to court, go to the witness box, spend a fortune in trying to defend their need to parent their own children against [ms avonlea]\u2019s view, \u201ci have a right to see these children, but i\u2019m not going to take the opportunity to see them, because ... i don\u2019t like my father\u201d. now, the report writer makes it quite clear she does not see that the father will be a risk to [ms avonlea], ... if he was there as a supervisor, for want [of a better] word. the report writer has indicated per your honour\u2019s questions that her current profile, her personality \u2013 [ms avonlea]\u2019s \u2013 well, i should say, current personality profile is reflected on her behaviour at the time that this breakdown occurred. it [is] reflected [in] her behaviour with [b] and reflected [in] her attitudes with the father. ... it\u2019s my submission, your honour, her personality now is risky. it\u2019s my submission, your honour, that there should be no orders made, the application should be dismissed. there\u2019s more than enough material to suggest that any reparation \u2013 any repairs of relationship that needs to be done can be done within the parties themselves and there\u2019s absolutely no need for any order that actually restricts the parents\u2019 time and the parents\u2019 choice and how the children spend their time in the interim. finally, ... it\u2019s my submission [ms avonlea]\u2019s argument, the reason she\u2019s not seeing her father, she\u2019s fearful: she\u2019s not fearful, is my submission. in fact, it\u2019s just a matter of control. she wants to be able to control the situation. when it comes to the situation between her and her father, so be it, but when it comes to the situation between her and the two children \u2013 the two other children, that\u2019s a different thing altogether. i have nothing more to add, your honour, thank you. evidence of ms gillies\u2019 psychologist & employer gillies] presented with symptoms consistent with high levels of stress and anxiety due to very complex family dynamics, with her ex-husband, her son (14) and her step-daughter [ms avonlea]. she stated that she had to deal with an abusive ex-husband and having to attend to court many times due to his manipulations of her son. now she and her current partner are having to deal with his ex-wife and their daughter (21). the daughter has been very abusive towards them. ... [ms gillies] continues to feel anxious due to her step daughter and now she and her partner have to go to court due to [[ms avonlea]]. this has caused her a lot of anxiety and distress. i have therefore suggested to [ms gillies] that it is important for her to continue with therapy and to return to you for a review. for many months, i observed that her mental health was being progressively impacted by these legal issues as they dragged on. [in mid-]2023, [ms gillies], our departmental manager and i met at 9am at [k venue] to discuss [work] issues. no amount of makeup could hide the stress around her eyes, the lack of sleep and her brittle smile. after discussing a minor oversight on [ms gillies]\u2019 part, she was in tears, which was highly uncharacteristic of [ms gillies]. i could see that she was no longer coping with the extraordinary stress of the court proceedings. concerned that she was experiencing a major mental health episode, i sent [ms gillies] home immediately and strongly recommended she see a doctor for a medical certificate for sick leave to address the mental health impact of the situation. not wanting to \u2018let me down\u2019, [ms gillies] felt that she would only need a few days leave, i knew that she would take a lot longer to recover. to date, [ms gillies] has been on personal leave for 6 weeks for which she has a medical certificate. [ms gillies] has my utmost support in her recovery, so she is able to successfully resume her full duties at [k venue] and hopefully with finalisation of these proceedings. ... since around mid-2021, i observed [ms avonlea] to become increasingly vocal and intrusive about her ideations and beliefs. for example, i recall her having a go at her dad because she felt we didn\u2019t have enough kitchen cupboard space like at her mother\u2019s house or buying the cheaper/inferior version of products compared to her mum. the biggest issue was her telling me to side with her against [mr daxton] in [late] 2021 and then with the dispute in [mid- 2022. i have been required to discuss my concerns with [mr daxton] and we agreed at various times that we would be required to remind [ms avonlea] to respect, or at least accept our personal boundaries and parenting of our children. this behaviour became more noticeable to me during the covid lockdowns in 2021 when [ms avonlea] was engaged in paid babysitting of the children over a 10-month period. in or around [late] 2021, when i was in the process of obtaining an intervention order for [b] protecting him from [[b]\u2019s father], my relationship with [ms avonlea] started to fracture following [ms avonlea]\u2019s criticism of me and [mr daxton] and our parenting of [b]. [ms avonlea] told me that i needed to \u201cstand up\u201d to [mr daxton] because i was \u201csubmissive\u201d and [b] \u201cwasn\u2019t his child\u201d. i was of the view that [ms avonlea] was wanting me to support [ms avonlea] in her argument with [mr daxton] drawing parallels with [ms avonlea]\u2019s own relationship struggles with [mr daxton] as [b]\u2019s lived experiences with his father. i disagreed with [ms avonlea]\u2019s position about [mr daxton] and found her accusations concerning and out of line. as we were not able to reach common ground, we \u2018agreed to disagree' with the understanding that [ms avonlea] would need to accept our parenting style which seemingly did not align with her views. from this date, [ms avonlea] continued to be involved in our family life but her behaviour towards both [mr daxton] and me had shifted. ... ... in about [late] 2022 i discovered the messages [ms avonlea] had been sending to [b] on the social media platform, [l] dating back as early as [late] 2021 (\u201cthe [l] messages\u201d) in which she was manipulating [b] and negatively influencing [b] against me and [mr daxton]. ... ... in a message dated [late] 2021, after finding a lost toy, [ms gillies] wrote \"only you can appreciate the trauma of this lol\". ... in a message dated [early] 2022, [ms gillies] wrote about [y] \"how cute is that. your own little moment together. she is very lucky to have you x\". [ms avonlea] created an elaborate and disturbing fake case study (\u201cthe fake case study\u201d) about fictitious characters that were based on her allegations that [b] was being emotionally harmed by [mr daxton] and i allowing it to occur. within days of the dispute, [ms avonlea] sent the fake case study to my sister also a psychologist [[ms n]] and [mr daxton]\u2019s sister [[ms j]] seeking their opinion which she pretended was an assignment for university. ... (b) in addition to [ms avonlea] making demands to spend time with [x] and [y] unsupervised, [mr daxton] was receiving abusive and threatening messages from [ms avonlea]\u2019s mother ( [mr daxton]\u2019s ex-wife), [[ms j]]. i read the messages [[ms j]] sent to [mr daxton] which contained threats of litigation and publicly defaming [mr daxton] if we didn\u2019t \u2018handover\u2019 our children to [ms avonlea] and provide her with supervised access to our children. she also was insinuating that she would fund the litigation, (c) [ms avonlea] told me in a phone conversation that she did not want a relationship with us and that she would continue saying anything she wanted to [b] and that she wouldn\u2019t be stopped. she was fixated on us handing over our children to her and didn\u2019t appear interested in repairing her relationship with me and [mr daxton] (set out in greater detail later in my affidavit), in addition to [ms avonlea] making demands to spend time with [x] and [y] unsupervised, [mr daxton] was receiving abusive and threatening messages from [ms avonlea]\u2019s mother ( [mr daxton]\u2019s ex-wife), [[ms j]]. i read the messages [[ms j]] sent to [mr daxton] which contained threats of litigation and publicly defaming [mr daxton] if we didn\u2019t \u2018handover\u2019 our children to [ms avonlea] and provide her with supervised access to our children. she also was insinuating that she would fund the litigation, (c) [ms avonlea] told me in a phone conversation that she did not want a relationship with us and that she would continue saying anything she wanted to [b] and that she wouldn\u2019t be stopped. she was fixated on us handing over our children to her and didn\u2019t appear interested in repairing her relationship with me and [mr daxton] (set out in greater detail later in my affidavit), [ms avonlea] told me in a phone conversation that she did not want a relationship with us and that she would continue saying anything she wanted to [b] and that she wouldn\u2019t be stopped. she was fixated on us handing over our children to her and didn\u2019t appear interested in repairing her relationship with me and [mr daxton] (set out in greater detail later in my affidavit), ... [in mid-]2022, i engaged a parenting coach [[ms p]] to assist with parenting issues of [b] involving [ms avonlea]. [[ms p]] reinforced the importance of unity between the adults in a child\u2019s life and the detrimental impact of [ms avonlea]\u2019s behaviour to actively undermine and discredit our parental authority, and she encouraged me discuss my concerns with [ms avonlea]. [in mid-]2022, i had a lengthy phone conversation with [ms avonlea] in an attempt to repair the relationship, however i was even more alarmed after our conversation when [ms avonlea] said she no longer wanted a relationship with [mr daxton] or me. further, [ms avonlea] told me that she was \u201cupset, frustrated and disappointed\u201d in me because i \u201cdefended\u201d her father during our disagreement back in [late] 2021 and that she felt \u201cbetrayed\u201d by me because she thought \u201cwe had something outside of my dad\u201d and her relationship with me had \u201cchanged forever\u201d and she could no longer confide in me. ... it was during this conversation [ms avonlea] said that she would be involving [b] and she deemed him mature and old enough to make his own informed decisions. i recall that [ms avonlea] said i couldn\u2019t stop her involving [b] in her dissatisfaction with our parenting and she \u201cwasn\u2019t interested\u201d to hear my point of view or \u201cexcuses\u201d and she was passionate about her \u201cfight for [b]\u201d stating that [mr daxton] \u201cdoesn\u2019t want the best for [b]\u201d and that \u201c[x] feels he is better\u201d. i recall that she followed on to talk about her own difficulties with her childhood, describing it as \u201cnot peaceful\u201d with a \u201clot of issues\u201d between [mr daxton] and [ms j] and drawing parallels with the dispute involving [b]. [ms avonlea]\u2019s final words to me were \u201ci will not be silenced\u201d, \u201ci will never stop\u201d and \u201ci do not want a relationship with you or my dad\u201d. this was extremely upsetting and concerning to me as i was hopeful that our family\u2019s relationship with [ms avonlea] could be repaired. [in mid-]2022, i wrote a letter to [ms avonlea] following our conversation, summarising what [ms avonlea] and i had discussed [in mid-]2022 and confirming that both [mr daxton] and i would be prepared to engage family therapy with her. after discussing the letter with [mr daxton] and my sister [ms n] i decided not to send the letter as i did not think the letter would assist and would only inflame the situation. annexed and marked \u201c-6\u201d is a copy of the letter i wanted to send to [ms avonlea]. [in mid-]2022 [ms avonlea] privately messaged [b] on [l messages] \u201cif you ever want to leave you tell me, ok\u201d for which [b] responded with \u201ci dont feel i need to leave\u201d followed by [in mid-]2022 by [ms avonlea] \u201chas mum or [mr daxton] said anything today?\u201d ... i rely upon the [l] messages as evidence demonstrating the psychological harm inflicted by [ms avonlea] towards [b], and the need to protect our younger two children ([x] and [y]) from being subjected to this abuse by their half-sister. for example, [ms avonlea] wrote to my son words to the effect \u201cyour mum and [mr daxton] are disgusting parents ...and you will not be the last in the family to go through this\u201d ([mid]-2022), \u201c[y] is just angel. but she\u2019ll turn on mum and [mr daxton]. she\u2019s too similar to me . she\u2019s fiery. yep cause he\u2019s [mr daxton]\u2019s son. [mr daxton]\u2019s always wanted a son. i honestly will end up with you and [y] living with me i can see it now. because she\u2019ll piss [mr daxton] off when she hits puberty she is a mini me. like 100% i\u2019ve taught her well...you will but she\u2019ll prob live with us too.. and i can handle [y]. [y] aint got nothing on me.\u201d ([late] 2022). ... also during this period of time, [b] was also questioning my and [mr daxton]\u2019s love for him and he would say to me that he was conflicted, wondering if [ms avonlea]\u2019s love was stronger and if he should also separate himself from the family unit and live with her. we are now aware that at this time [ms avonlea] was actively telling [b] that he, and the children, could live with her, coaching [b] what to do and say when we attempted to discipline [b]. at one point, [b] left home for two nights to stay with [ms avonlea] after an argument about our rules and without my permission. [emphasis added] expert evidence: the family report given there was no dispute between [ms avonlea] and [mr daxton] and [ms gillies] regarding the nature of interactions between [ms avonlea] and [x] and [y], or between [x], [y], [mr daxton] and [ms gillies] (which were overall, described as positive by all parties), i chose not to conduct the observational interviews. further, the issues raised pertaining to [ms avonlea] and [x] and [ms gillies]\u2019 interactions via on-line/electronic mediums would not be elicited in a face-to-face observational interview and hence this would not be instructive in the formation of a view about this family\u2019s presenting difficulties. ... [ms avonlea] described a history of mental health difficulties, namely anxiety and panic attacks dating back to her childhood, in addition to anorexia nervosa and orthorexia nervosa (an eating disorder characterised by an excessive preoccupation with healthy food). ... she explained that she struggled to adjust to her father and [ms gillies] moving in together at that time, highlighting that she does not cope well with change. she added that she also felt abandoned by her father because she perceived that he began to spend less time with her. other triggers to her panic attacks included her father yelling at her and \u201cgrabbing\u201d her on one occasion, as previously mentioned in this report. she stated that her panic attacks now occur irregularly, the last one taking place during covid19 in 2020. ... during the current assessment, when i asked [ms avonlea] about recent events referred to in her affidavits involving [mr daxton], [b] and [ms gillies] that led to a breakdown in her relationships with them, [ms avonlea] expressed a view that [b] confided in her regarding conflict he was having at home with [mr daxton]. she alleged that she had also witnessed [mr daxton] yelling at [b], \u201ccontrolling\u201d him and ignoring him and was concerned that her father was treating [b] in the same way that she perceived he treated her. she asserted that all of her actions and communications with [b] during this time period were driven by a desire to support and protect him. when asked why she asked [b]to delete some of their on-line communications, [ms avonlea] explained she did not want [b] to \u201cget into trouble\u201d. during the current interview, [ms avonlea] displayed insight regarding [mr daxton]\u2019s concerns related to her spending time with [x] and [y] on her own, that being that she might \u201cconvince the kids he is not a good parent\u201d. she reflected awareness that her commenting on her father\u2019s parenting decisions and expressing her disagreement with these in the manner she did, as well as her venting to [b] about her own frustrations regarding her relationship with her father, has impacted [b] negatively. she acknowledged that it would have been confusing for [b] and likely impeded his decision-making. [ms avonlea] conceded that at the time she felt that she had someone (i.e., [b]) that understood what she \u201cwent through\u201d, here, seemingly referring to her conflictual relationship with her father. she perceived that in the future she would keep her thoughts to herself and would not provide feedback if she disagreed with her father and [ms gillies]\u2019 parenting decisions. [ms avonlea] was also able to identify that if [b], [x] or [y] ever raised concerns about their relationships with their parents with her in the future, she would direct them to speak to their school or a counsellor. ... [ms avonlea] expressed ambivalence about repairing her relationship with her father. when asked what would need to occur for to be able to rebuild this relationship, [ms avonlea] replied that it would be the passage of time and her having contact with her siblings. ... the millon clinical multiaxial inventory-fourth edition (mcmi-iv) was administered to [ms avonlea]. ... [ms avonlea]\u2019s mcmi-iv clinical profile was reflective of her experiencing significant mental health difficulties, namely the presence of personality difficulties (commensurate with her history and presentation at interview). [ms avonlea]\u2019s results profile was reflective of an individual who is energetic, ambitious and exudes optimism, however, this at times results in her disregarding healthy limits and boundaries in her interactions with others, leaving her and others vulnerable to experiencing distress and exhaustion. personality patterns identified from [ms avonlea]\u2019s mcmi-iv profile include her having a passion for challenging endeavors and engaging in goal directed behaviours. she is also frequently able to coax others into doing things they would otherwise not do, and often, is successful in exciting their own wish fulfilment in the process. [ms avonlea]\u2019s mcmi-iv profile is also suggestive of her self-awareness and reality testing against insurmountable challenges tending to be poor. this way of approaching her life and interacting with others can lead to relationship conflict. [ms avonlea] also has a tendency to view herself as meticulous, efficient, disciplined and industrious and has some perfectionistic qualities with regard to her appearance, and success in various domains of her life. also salient is her highly structured and organised life. [ms avonlea]\u2019s response style was also suggestive of her experiencing significant depressive symptoms triggered by interpersonal and vocational setbacks and her feeling a sense of powerlessness. individuals with these characteristics are prone to experiencing intense humiliation and to fight against this by externalizing blame for their predicament onto others, as well as experiencing shame and guilt that they protect themselves from. [ms avonlea]\u2019s mcmi-iv results profile is also suggestive of her experiencing significant anxiety symptoms, including physical symptoms. ... [ms avonlea] presents as a young woman who has suffered mental health difficulties stemming back to her adolescent years which appear to be occurring in the context of parental separation when she was a child, adjusting to both parents forming new relationships, as well as social difficulties at school and difficulties within both parental relationships at various stages in her life. [ms avonlea] reports that she has struggled with anxiety and depression, panic attacks and eating disorders in her adolescence. her personality is marked by features that include a fear of abandonment from those close to her and a sensitivity to rejection from others, as well as a passion and optimism for life. she also appears to be forthright in her views, struggles interpersonally and displays a proneness to overstepping boundaries in her interpersonal relationships. further to this, [ms avonlea] possesses a narrative that she has been largely rejected by her father and feels hurt by him, and continues to experience unresolved distress, alongside what appears to be anger and resentment, towards him. in my view, whilst it seems that [b] reached out to [ms avonlea] for support during conflict with his mother and step-father, amidst other issues he was grappling with, through the course of her involvement with [b], and perhaps genuine concern for him and a wish to support him, some of this anger and hurt she feels towards her father appears to have been projected onto, and influenced, her actions involving [b]. [emphasis added] ms smallwood: yes. and you were given instructions by their parents that everything is fine with them in terms of their interpersonal relationship with their parents? [dr e]: their parents had observed that over the course of the last 12 months, they were displaying some, i guess, clinginess or reassurance \u2013 seeking reassurance that their parents loved them, so i think they were unsettled for a period of time, but both parents indicated that they, i guess, were coming out of that and settling and doing well in their school environments and socially and with their activities after school. ms smallwood: and did either of their parents or both of them indicate to you why \u2013 any reason why they \u2013 that they attached to this alleged unsettled state of the children \u2013 younger children for the last year? [dr e]: i think a combination of factors. i think the whole family unit being unsettled in terms of both parents\u2019 mental health not being great during that time, conflict within the household with [b], and conflict with [ms avonlea], in terms of the interactions with b and how that has unfolded, i think took its toll on the whole family unit in different ways, and i think also other factors in terms of [ms gillies] dealing with [b]\u2019s father and court processes there and difficult processes there. i think a lot of factors sort of intervening in terms of impacting on their mental health and \u2013 which is not, i guess, predicted in terms of how that impacts then on the children. ... [dr e]: that [ms avonlea] having no contact with [x] and [y] would impact their relationship. yes. ms smallwood: it would be a loss to [y] and [x]? [dr e]: yes, in terms of a relationship - - - ms smallwood: thank you? [dr e]: - - - with their sister. ms smallwood: exactly. and so whilst you say \u2013 so that would be a bad thing. correct \u2013 for [x] and [y]? [dr e]: a loss of the relationship to their sister, yes. ms smallwood: yes. and contrary to their welfare, wouldn\u2019t it be? [dr e]: if that was a positive \u2013 yes, if that continued to be a positive relationship - - - ms smallwood: exactly. exactly? [dr e]: - - - ..... but, yes, as it stands. ... [ms gillies] indicated that she separated from [b]\u2019s father when he was 12 months old. she also alleged that she was victim of domestic violence within this relationship. she confirmed that [b] has a current family violence intervention order in place against his father due to him expressing feeling unsafe in his father\u2019s care, and her perception that his father has a history of being manipulative and controlling towards her and [b]. [ms gillies] indicated that [b]\u2019s father sees [b] monthly for three hours in a public place, with this arrangement being stipulated in parenting orders made 1-2 years ago. [ms gillies] reported that [b] is vulnerable to being manipulated and taken advantage of by others and thus she is protective of him. [ms gillies] reported that her next significant intimate relationship following her separation from [b]\u2019s father is with [mr daxton]. she described their relationship in positive terms, referring to him as her \u201crock\u201d, him being very supportive of her, and a kind and caring partner. [ms gillies] also indicated that from what she has observed, [mr daxton] was a good father to [ms avonlea]. [ms gillies] spoke about her three children in a caring and warm manner and appeared focused on providing them with nurturance and safety. she also displayed sensitivity and responsiveness to their current needs, such as, for example, [x]\u2019s learning needs and his self-confidence, and [y]\u2019s need for predictability and reassurance. it appears from her descriptions (and voiced by the children and [mr daxton] when i met with each of them) that [x] and [y] are settled and progressing well at school, are engaged in many activities and have good friendship networks. it also appears that both [ms gillies] and [mr daxton] are actively involved in [x] and [y]\u2019s lives and are supporting their development and associated needs. [ms gillies] also indicated that [b] is progressing well this year, has a new job and a girlfriend, and has received positive feedback from his teacher during a recent parent-teacher interview. ... when discussing her relationship with [ms avonlea], [ms gillies]\u2019 narrative was marked by her feeling distressed and hurt by [ms avonlea]\u2019s actions, as well as her feeling betrayed by [ms avonlea]. ... [ms gillies]\u2019 also expressed concern regarding [ms avonlea] causing friction between her half-siblings by highlighting to [b] that [mr daxton] is not his father and accusing [mr daxton] of favouring [x]. [ms gillies] also disclosed that [ms avonlea] encouraged [b] to leave the family home and contacted his [sports club] to cancel his lesson without [mr daxton] and [ms gillies]\u2019 permission, as well asking [b] for details of his independent children\u2019s lawyer, visiting his school and advocating or a safety plan to be written for [b] to protect him from [mr daxton]. during her interview, [ms gillies] spoke about the detrimental impact [ms avonlea]\u2019s actions have had on her family unit, including her relationship with [mr daxton], which at one stage last year deteriorated to such an extent that they considered whether it could \u201csurvive\u201d. [ms gillies] reflected that she had previously provided significant support to [ms avonlea], and had welcomed her into her and her family of origin\u2019s lives, and was incredulous regarding [ms avonlea]\u2019s treatment of her. [ms gillies] also spoke of the decline to both her and [mr daxton]\u2019s mental health in 2022, in addition to [b]\u2019s mental health. further, whilst they have attempted to shield [x] and [y] from these events, [ms gillies] reported that she has noticed [y] has been, and continues to, display \u201cclingy\u201d behaviour, as well as evidencing an excessive need to tell them she loves them and seek their reassurance that they love her. [ms gillies] added that [x] has also engaged in a pattern of checking where his father is and seeking assurances that he is coming home. [x]\u2019s behaviour has been triggered by [mr daxton] leaving the family home to seek respite at their investment property last year, sometimes for a few days at a time. [ms gillies] also indicated that [y] struggles to adjust to changes in her environment, and thus consistency and routine are important for her well-being and sense of safety. proposals [ms gillies] echoed the proposals [mr daxton] made during the current assessment, as well as the reasons driving these. she did not perceive that [ms avonlea]\u2019s desire to impose legal orders relating to their children was necessary, nor is it aligned with [ms avonlea]\u2019s claims of wanting to repair her relationship with [ms gillies]. [ms gillies] also expressed concern that these orders might be misused by [ms avonlea] and potentially cause all involved further distress. [emphasis added] ... ... [y] also described her relationship with [ms avonlea] in positive terms. she did not describe experiencing any worries, and impressed as having a positive self-esteem. as i was finishing the session i asked if there was anything else that she wanted to tell me. [y] identified that she would like to continue seeing [ms avonlea] with [x], however, she would like this to be her choice. she explained that she did not want to miss out on seeing her friends or going to a party if this conflicted with time [ms avonlea] wanted to spend with her. she also stated that she did not want to stay overnight at [ms avonlea]\u2019s place because she \u201cgets scared\u201d being away from home, with this amplified due to [ms avonlea] living some distance from her home. [y] also volunteered that she preferred to meet with [ms avonlea] with her brother, [x], in her parent\u2019s presence, as well as sometimes spending time with [ms avonlea] for \u201ca little bit\u201d when she wants to. significant events and the l communications late 2021: the start of big trouble late 2021: the start of the l communications avonlea]: is everything okay there? do you feel ok being there? [b]: yeah why are you asking this all of a sudden [ms avonlea]: because i worry...how you are treated isn\u2019t normal ...i\u2019m just saying if [mr daxton] ever cause any issues or hurts you please tell me [b]: nah it\u2019s fine [mr daxton]: cause my mum will take you in instantly if you need be...my dad caused problems before... ...how you are treated by [mr daxton] and what [mr daxton] says to mum is not right [ms avonlea]: has mum been getting worse with you? like more angry and stuff?

[b]: yes [ms avonlea]: yes what? [b]: mmmm = yes ... [b]: because if i mess up he doesn\u2019t listen to what happened [ms avonlea]: yeh, like with [x] and stuff? [b]: ? [ms avonlea]: like if you and [x] arguing or other stuff? [b]: yeah [x] doesn\u2019t get the much in trouble but i would even if i didn\u2019t do anything ...

[mr daxton] you say move forward, what it is that [ms avonlea] wants and what do i need to do? i have apologised on more than one occasion. [ms avonlea] has always been allowed to see the kids at the park with me there or come over and play with them here. what more am i supposed to do? tread carefully engaging with me when i have kept your fucking of me without permission quiet. i keep your secret to this day... do not do this to our daughter because you can\u2019t take a deep breath and accept she\u2019s a firecracker... do not hold the kids from her ... ... do not drag my daughter into anything unnecessary ... just don\u2019t. won\u2019t be pleasant and i will never let it rest. you will find i have the stamina to go the distance and it will be the ugliest situation of your life if you hurt [ms avonlea] any more. the end of the l communications avonlea]: [late] 2022 do you want to come to mine cause they won\u2019t let you see [x]? [b]: [late] 2022 yeah and cause i hate the rules here is ms avonlea fearful of mr daxton? hi dad, after out last conversation, i feel very stressed and uncomfortable spending time in your home. i don\u2019t feel safe or welcome. i\u2019m hurt by where we are at. i\u2019m very sad that [ms gillies] screamed at me in what was my home, and neither of you can recognise that that is hurtful. i acknowledge that i raised my voice that night, however, i was only met with aggression, anger and attack so as so, i too got on the attack. she is only my stepmother....she doesn\u2019t get to speak to me like that and it\u2019s all ok. ... mr combes: okay. you must have disliked him quite a bit? [ms avonlea]: i wouldn\u2019t say i disliked him. i was incredibly hurt by him ... as a young child mr combes: yes. why were you hurt by him or what were the reasons for you being hurt by him? [ms avonlea]: my dad was very absent for a lot of my childhood. mr combes: yes. was that with work or - - - his honour: hang on. just let the witness answer the question, please. mr combes: i\u2019m sorry. yes, your honour. the witness: he was absent for a lot of \u2013 many things in my life, even after \u2013 before and after my parents split. you know, there was \u2013 it always felt like the things he would do with me were to tick a box. for instance, going to the football 5 together, i\u2019m naturally quite a chatty person and he wouldn\u2019t talk to me the whole time we were there. he would basically tell me to be quiet and just to watch the game, and we never really had conversations whilst we were there or didn\u2019t spend time actually connecting. conclusion as to the l communications section 60cc factors meaningful relationship with both of the children\u2019s parents the need to protect children from physical or psychological harm i am deeply concerned if there is unsupervised contact between [ms avonlea] and the children it will likely have a significant and detrimental impact on my parenting capacity and my relationship with [mr daxton]. i am exhausted and struggling to cope due to my history of family violence and repeat trauma by ongoing proceedings and these proceedings have already had an impact on my emotional ability to be available to our children and my husband. i have been on stress leave from work since [mid-] 2023 and now medicated with anti-depressants and sleeping tablets due to the repeat trauma and concurrent court proceedings for all three of my children: and ramifications of this dispute on me personally and my family unit. ... prior to late 2021, [b] and i have had a close relationship and i have treated him as my son to the best of my abilities and attempted to have his best interests at the forefront, as i do for [x] and [y], of all decisions regarding our family. i observed a decline in [b]\u2019s behaviour towards [ms gillies] and i from around late 2021 and particularly after the dispute in [mid]-2022. for example, [b] started avoiding me, he\u2019d spend more time in his bedroom and started arguing with me or arguing with [ms gillies] in front of me. ... i am aware that there was a decline in [b]\u2019s school grades and had become withdrawn and disengaged and had lost his \u201cspark\u201d with signs of depression and suicidal thoughts following a review conducted by the school\u2019s mental health assessment. i recall that [b] commenced questioning my and [ms gillies\u2019] love for him, and he would tell me and [ms gillies] that he was conflicted as to whether [ms avonlea]\u2019s love was stronger and if he should also separate himself from the family unit and live with her. as a consequence of the ongoing communication between [b] and [ms avonlea], i observed that [b] started to lose his emotional connection with us, and his sense of self. he became dismissive and evasive towards me. i was (as was [ms gillies]) worried for [b] and for his mental health. [b] also started saying that we favoured [x] over him, and we noticed that [b] started deliberately ignoring [x] or leaving him out of games with [y], which we are now aware was due to [ms avonlea]\u2019s influence. [x] started noticing and saying words to the effect, \"[b] hates me\" and then he retreated from [b] saying, \"i hate [b] \". ... i have seen a dramatic improvement in [b]\u2019s wellbeing and happiness since november 2022 when [b] stopped communicating with [ms avonlea]. ... my relationship with [ms avonlea] has now declined to a position where i feel emotionally psychologically abused by her in an attempt to ostracise me and [ms gillies] from our close family, [b], each other and ultimately undermine my relationship with them. the ongoing disputes has not only taken an enormous toll on my relationship with [ms gillies], but also on my and [ms gillies\u2019] emotional and psychological wellbeing. additional considerations any views expressed by the child nature of relationship with each of the child\u2019s parents and other persons courts are often reluctant to separate siblings based upon the presumption that children benefit from growing up with brothers and sisters and should remain together. further, to separate them would mean that they would grow up as strangers and \"create a household divided against itself\". a marital break-up is a traumatic event to all members involved and is experienced by siblings individually and also together as a unit. ... for this reason, split custody seems undesirable because it not only breaks the continuity of a relationship with an adult but also breaks the continuity of a relationship with a sibling. capacity of parents & ms avonlea to provide for children\u2019s emotional and intellectual needs maturity, background and culture of the children family violence involving a member of the child\u2019s family final or interim orders any other fact or circumstance conclusion costs associate: dated: 26 october 2023 dated: 26 october 2023 appendix examples of the l communication from annexure 1 of ms gillies\u2019 trial affidavit : [mid]-2022 [mr daxton] has gone pyscho [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 why?? ... you ok?

[ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 i\u2019ve asked various different adults over the weekend ... some i\u2019ve told it\u2019s about you and others i\u2019ve posed as a uni scenario and changed it to get advice so they wouldn\u2019t know it\u2019s about you ... one of those is [ms n], [ms gillies\u2019] sister] ... so ... this is not ok [b]: [mid]-2022 it came up in conversation last night, that i said \"im trying will that not be good enough\" and she said \"no, try harder\" i said \"i am trying\" and mum said \"well trying harder\" ... and she also said that whoever you speak to no one can change my mind [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 that is disgusting behaviour ... and i called your mum out on it and she stormed off and didn\u2019t give me any explanation just yelled at me... so ... if i never speak to your mum again this is partly why. she treated me awfully on friday night. awfully. ... she was beyond disrespectful to me and was very nasty ... i want you to know that when i say what i say to you it doesn\u2019t come from a place of trying to get back at your mum and [mr daxton]. it\u2019s comes from a place of genuine concern for you because i\u2019ve been through something similar and i know the type of person my dad was to my mum ... i want you to know that everything i say to you is considered and well thought out and i seek advice from numerous sources and isn\u2019t just me being a rude kid. it is the advice from numerous adults. one being a school teacher in a catholic school, one being a psychologist, and one being an objective point of view. ... after today i will have spoken to 6 different adults about this. ... 6 ... so know that whatever your mum and [mr daxton] say is not gospel and is not correct ... every single person i have spoken to is worried about you and tell me that this is not normal nor is it ok ... and you will not be the last in the family to go through this. [y] will be next. [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah ... i will probs just message the teacher through microsoft teams through text [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 i am on your side forever. your mum and [mr daxton] are disgusting parents. this is not good parenting. it does not respect you as a human and does not take into account your feelings. this is not ok. ... [b]: [mid]-2022 could you give some examples of whats happened because i have forgotten most of them [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 yes. that is a symptom of domestic abuse by the way ... i have the same problem ... and they make you feel like what you think is wrong. like if you feel the behaviour isn\u2019t right they will make you think it isn\u2019t significant and so you compartmentalise and forget it ... list of things... brother treats you as less than him already and he is 7... yelled at for every small thing you do when [x] doesn\u2019t have that ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 you are not alone no matter what ... there is an army around you to support you x ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 delete all messages on [l messaging] if ya can pls ... or change your privacy settings and lock everything with a new password no one knows ... and turn all your notifications off for all devices when you get them back ...that way they can never see them ... and put in my mobile number ... not yours ... cause they have access to yours ... i\u2019m moving across to my mums plan so they won\u2019t be able to get mine ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 and you ask her if she thinks what you're going through is normal and ok ... and you just tell her the things mum and [mr daxton] have said and done [b]: [mid]-2022 idk.. [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 or if you want to organise a time with her if you'd prefer i was there or you can say can i have my sister on speaker phone or something ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 has anything happened? ... [b]: [mid]-2022 nope [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 i guess that\u2019s good ... how are you feeling? [b]: [mid]-2022 idk ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 how are you feelings towards mum and [mr daxton]? ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 i\u2019ve been saying for about 8-10 years now that something is wrong and they way you are treated isn\u2019t right [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah ... i have to do the dishes ... brb ... mrs has asked whats the problem what exactly do i say? [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 you say what you think you should tell her or what you want to tell her and ask for help ... things a long the lines of i\u2019m having issues with my mum and step dad... [ellipses in original] [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 and go from there ...

[b]: [mid]-2022 yeah sure i\u2019ll try ... [b]: [mid]-2022 i think if u start talking to them again ... mum and [mr daxton] ... u will be able to see them [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 they haven\u2019t reached out to me ... i don\u2019t have anything to say to them ... they\u2019ve been awful to me ... i\u2019m heartbroken [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah just say i thought u would like to know have covid ... or something like that [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 they actually don\u2019t deserve to know ... they don\u2019t care about me buddy ... i don\u2019t think you realise that ... they actually don\u2019t care about me ... my own dad doesn\u2019t care about me at all ... and your mum couldn\u2019t care less about me ... i\u2019m nothing to them ... nothing ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 and soon enough [y] and [x] will probably forget who i am and you guys will be happy harmonious united family without me ... and that\u2019s sad for me ... because i have none of you ... i don\u2019t have your mums family ... i don\u2019t have [mr daxton]\u2019s family ... and i don\u2019t have my own siblings ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 but that\u2019s how mum and [mr daxton] are spinning it to themselves and to everyone else ... i\u2019m basically just waiting for [y] and [x] to get their own phones so i can talk to them [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 because i have no communication with them unless it\u2019s through you [b]: [mid]-2022 i\u2019m year 4/they will [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 and mum and [mr daxton] are using my love for them as their upper hand ... because they think i will reach out first so i can talk to them ... that\u2019s why i\u2019m asking you ... because i\u2019m not going to bullied and manipulated anymore ... i\u2019m sick of being hurt. i am depressed, anxious and exhausted because of them. i never ever talked shit about them to you yet that\u2019s what they\u2019ve believed. i\u2019m not going to be quiet about it anymore. [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah it sucks [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 i\u2019m sick of this harmonious unity family shit. if that was the case i wouldn\u2019t be at my own home with no contact with any of them ... it\u2019s actually not ok and it\u2019s quite ridiculous [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah it is [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 they are not the victim in any of this. i have done nothing to them. not a single thing except question they\u2019re abusive behaviour. i asked a question. and now i am here. by myself. ... so whatever way they spin it is wrong ... they are not the victims at all ... never have been [b]: [mid]-2022 yea [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 my dad has never been a victim. he perpetrates. he abuses and he manipulates and he charms and he gets away with it ... it is the reason i will not make contact [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 i will not talk to a rapist who refuses to behave like an adult and talk to his own daughter ... i am broken. ... i am hurt [b]: [mid]-2022 please don\u2019t be hurt [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 and i cannot forgive their behaviour. your mum has offended and hurt me at the deepest level because she has said and told you things about me that are not true whatsoever. she has tried to manipulate you and that is not ok. [b]: [mid]-2022 i know it\u2019s hard ... yeah i will always have to ask if it\u2019s true ... which ik it\u2019s not [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 wdym ask if what\u2019s true? [b]: [mid]-2022 when mum is saying stuff that\u2019s not true [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 oh right ... anything they say about is nearly 100% not true ... me* ... as you can quite literally see i have gained nothing from speaking up, trying to protect my siblings. nothing. ... so whatever she says is bullshit and i\u2019d call her out on it if i could ... because this is hurtful, teenage behaviour from her ... she has hurt me just as much as my dad has because i trusted her more ... and i didn\u2019t expect it from her ... so i will not let her have her pretty picture anymore that she has done nothing wrong [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 because if that\u2019s what you think she is and then she says shit about me it makes it easier to believe and i\u2019m just not a bad person at all. i am not. [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 this has destroyed me entirely [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah i bet it has [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 my sister is literally my best friend and i haven\u2019t been able to speak to her in almost a month. it kills me. she is like my other half. i can\u2019t even explain what it feels like to have that ripped away ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 because im being ostracised for no reason [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 your mum is making me out to be a bad person ... and i wont have it ... so i will fix it myself ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 at the moment, the things your mum and [mr daxton] are saying to me are awful and are gaslighting and abusive. i would make sure you analyse what they say to you before completely believing it is true. i have just gotten a text from your mum that has absolutely hurt me to the core. i\u2019m not trying to destroy or ruin your relationship with your mum at all but i think that [mr daxton] has completely tainted her and destroyed the good parts of her that i appreciated. [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah ... do i wanna know the messga ... also mum said ask her before u can meet the kids like how u ask me to call with the kids [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 it won\u2019t make much sense to you because it doesn\u2019t seem like much but she has dismissed who i am entirely as a person ... she has just gaslighted the fuck out of me ... for fuck sake [b]: [mid]-2022 thats gay [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 i have nothing left bro. you know i love you and the kids more than anything. i wouldn\u2019t do anything to hurt you guys at all or hurt your relationship with them [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah ik that ... and we love you too [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 this is truly killing me and i can\u2019t just watch abuse ... because right now me standing my ground and calling out is ensuring they aren\u2019t doing it again to you atm ... i\u2019m being deadset honest ... they\u2019ll be careful for as long as i am doing this because they know you\u2019ll come to me and [mr daxton] knows i can tear it apart in seconds ... your mum has no idea but i could genuinely turn shit upside down ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 have your mum or [mr daxton] said anything recently? ... or have you overheard anything? [b]: [mid]-2022 nope ... i\u2019m not at school [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 everything all good?? [b]: [mid]-2022 cause sick ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 if this doesn\u2019t get resolved soon i\u2019ll be going to court ... i have a legal right to see them ... not you but them i do [b]: [mid]-2022 oh damn [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 they\u2019re fucking w the wrong person ... and being horrible ... they\u2019re being really really awful ... and the whole family refuses to say anything ... i have genuinely just lost 3 families forever [b]: [mid]-2022 do the [gillies] family not want to talk to u? [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 nope. [ms n] refused to talk to me [b]: [mid]-2022 oh shit [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 mum and [mr daxton] have changed the narrative so that i\u2019ve done the wrong thing ... i hope you believe i haven\u2019t [b]: [mid]-2022 ik u havnt [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 ok ... everyone is just trying to turn a blind eye ... it\u2019s really fucking hurtful [b]: [mid]-2022 yeah i bet it. is ... im not sure how to fix it tbh [ms avonlea]: [mid]-/2022 i haven\u2019t ever done anything inappropriate to you or the kids so the only reason they\u2019re withholding them is because i have a differing opinion ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 and [mr daxton] fucked himself over by messaging my mum ... so he will be pissed probs [b]: [mid]-2022 what exactly did he say [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 hi [t], just letting you know that i am very concerned with [ms avonlea]\u2019s behaviour at the moment and in particular for her well being. [mr daxton] : [mid]-2022 oh damn [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 he stuffed up ... he big time fucked up ... tell me when you\u2019ve read them and imma delete them from chat [b]: [mid]-2022 damn yeah ... ok ... done [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 he effectively just threatened my mum ... his ex wife [b]: [mid]-2022 that\u2019s not good [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 he fucked up ... it\u2019s a long story ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 how do you feel about you relationships with each of them? [b]: [mid]-2022 got more distant with mum [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 in what way? [b]: [mid]-2022 just she has been more angry ... she didn\u2019t used to be ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 are you upset that your relationship with mum isn\u2019t as good? ... does it upset you that mums let [mr daxton] treat you this way and now she\u2019s doing the same? ... i\u2019m not going to say anything. just trying to understand. this is just between you and me ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 mum and [mr daxton] will probs be telling [ms r] everything [b]: [mid]- 2022 doubt [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 i don\u2019t ... they\u2019ll also blame any future problems you have w them on me [b]: [mid]- 2022 that\u2019s stupid [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 yes but they will do just be aware [b]: [mid]- 2022 ok [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 im not trying to poison you or cause problems just educate and let you know [b]: [mid]- 2022 ik that [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 and i know they will because they\u2019ve done it to me, mainly [mr daxton]... i know but they will manipulate it and spin it until you don\u2019t believe it [b]: [mid]- 2022 ok ... i will be prepared [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 you kind of just have to second guess everything they say unfortunately ... and you never ever have to agree with a decision they make. you are your own person. just remember that. you have a voice and you\u2019re allowed to use it ... [b]: [mid]- 2022 i probs don\u2019t have anything on one of these days [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 it\u2019s up to you. i\u2019ll be going to the farm probs this weekend and if you really wanted to come ... all up to you ... also fucking funny ... he said i won\u2019t be told how to parent my children in my house. these are my children ... and i said ... i\u2019ve never commented on how you parent your children ... this started because it wasn\u2019t your child ... [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 have mum or [mr daxton] said anything to you recently? or have you overheard anything? [b]: [mid]- 2022 no ... why [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 curious i guess ... i have no contact w anyone ... just feels shit tbh ... none of my families will talk to me on that side ... and i can\u2019t speak to [x] and [y]... it\u2019s not great ...

[ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 ---> i am serious [b]. you are being incredibly selfish recently and it is hurtful behaviour. incredibly hurtful. think back to the conversation we had at the farm. you are treading a very fine line ... did you just drop off the face of the earth [b]: [mid]- 2022 no ... alr i said to [s], [b]\u2019s friend] lets go out tmr [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 it\u2019s not about that ... it\u2019s the fact that you are hurting people [b]: [mid]- 2022 how? [ms avonlea]: [mid]- 2022 really badly ... you have been awful to me recently. ignoring me. blowing me off. not seeing me. not talking to me. not doing anything with me. it\u2019s rude ... and you are seriously hurting [s], [b]\u2019s friend] ... you have effectively abandoned him for his ex [b]: [mid]-2022 i havnt been blowing u off [ms avonlea]: [mid]-2022 it\u2019s not ok. you are choosing girls over those that truly care about you ... yes you do blow me off. get as pissed as you want but that\u2019s what you have done. i have asked numerous times to see you and if you wanted to come over or anything but you always say no and blow me off. ... it\u2019s hurtful. ... all you care about is having a girlfriend and not being a decent human. having a girlfriend and hanging out with girls is not a personality trait and is not nice. it\u2019s incredibly selfish, rude, hurtful and i am sick of just accepting a half arsed relationship from you. ... i have put my arse on the line and have defended you for almost two months now. and honestly, the reason home has been good for you recently is because of me. that is the honest truth. i don\u2019t expect you to get it but i am extremely upset. i am hurt. [b]: [mid]-2022 i am sorry, i know this wont cut it, but i am sorry. i have not realized how my actions have hurt you. i also thankyou for defending me and looking after me. as i said before, i know this wont cut it, but i am sorry. ... could i come over to your place on saturday?

applications between the same parties the same filing number cannot in our view, override the clear provisions of the family law act, that there are distinct proceedings depending on the nature of the relief claimed. the question of whether the application is in the same proceeding or in the same cause is crucial and is determined by reference to the structure and content of the definition of \u2018matrimonial cause\u2019 in the act, the relevant parts of the act and the ...rules... that apply and, ultimately whether the proceedings may be identified as distinct because the nature of the relief claimed in them respectively is determinative.[16] we consider that the determination of what constitutes proceedings is governed by identification of the separate causes of action on which one or more of the parties move and not by the administrative allocation of a file number to causes of action.[17] ...if breached orders are left unenforced, public confidence in the courts capacity to quell litigious disputes is undermined. the disobedience of orders inevitably involves, first, an innocent party incurring more cost and inconvenience to enforce the orders against the defaulting party, and second, the diversion of resources by the courts from other deserving disputes to entertain the enforcement applications...[23] conclusion associate: dated: 27 october 2023 dated: 27

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 2 december 2021 federal circuit and family court of australia(division 2) bahan & pinder [2021] fedcfamc2f 347 orders the court orders that: 1. pursuant to section 90rd(2) there is a declaration that the parties were in a de facto relationship between 2014 and 2019 and for a period of at least 4 years and 6 months. reasons for judgment judge taglieri 1 on 1 july 2020, ms bahan (\u201cthe applicant\u201d) filed an initiating application seeking final orders for adjustment of property interests with mr pinder (\u201cthe respondent\u201d). the application sought to invoke the court\u2019s jurisdiction pursuant to part viiiab of the family law act 1975 (\u201cthe act\u201d), which concerns financial matters relating to de facto relationships. 2 on 10 august 2020, the respondent filed a response to initiating application seeking a declaration that the applicant and respondent were never in a de facto relationship and, consequently, a dismissal of the initiating application. 3 prior to the matter first coming before me on 27 may 2021, the parties had agreed that the threshold issue, existence of a de facto relationship, be heard separately. i was asked to allocate a hearing date for the threshold issue and it was set down for a two day hearing commencing 22 september 2021. 4 the applicant is 31 years old. she is currently employed on a casual basis as an admin assistant and now lives in rented accommodation with her partner. 5 the respondent is 29 years old. he is currently employed as an tradesman and resides in a property which he owns at b street, town c (\u201cthe b street, town c property\u201d), which he purchased from the applicant\u2019s father in 2016. the opposing cases 6 the applicant\u2019s case is that she and the respondent were in a de facto relationship within the meaning of section 4aa of the act, and so the court has jurisdiction to make orders for adjustment of property interests as sought by her. her contention is that the parties were in a relationship from march 2012 to june 2019, a period of 7 years, during which: they continually co-habited at various residences for over 6 years, they maintained a sexual relationship, both the applicant and respondent were in paid employment, the respondent earned more and financially supported the applicant, \u201cthere was a degree of financial interdependence\u201d[1] in that they shared expenses such as groceries, the electricity bill on the b street, town c property, and expenses relating to their animals, the parties were committed to a shared life together, in that: they shared interest in animals and cared for them together, the applicant would refer work to the respondent, the applicant\u2019s father assisted the respondent purchase the property where the parties resided as a couple, and the respondent\u2019s relationship with the applicant was an integral part of this occurring, the parties jointly sought restraining orders against mr d following his assault by the respondent, and the applicant undertook domestic duties for the parties during the relationship while the respondent undertook fifo work to \u201cset them up financially\u201d.[2] the parties presented publically as a couple and would socialise together, including with each other\u2019s families and friends. 7 it is the respondent\u2019s case that he and the applicant were in a \u201ccasual, boyfriend/girlfriend relationship\u201d[3] apart from a period from august 2016 to october 2016, during which they lived together on a genuine domestic basis. he asks the court to make a declaration that no de facto relationship existed, on the basis that: the parties retained their own residences, save for the period august 2016 to october 2016, the parties had a \u201csporadic\u201d, non-exclusive sexual relationship, and each were in relationships with other people, the parties were financially independent, earning their own income and paying their own expenses, there was no mutual commitment to a shared life, either expressed or demonstrated, and the relationship, as presented to and perceived by other people, \u201cnever carried with it public aspects and reputations\u201d[4] of a relationship capable of meeting the level required pursuant to section 4aa of the act. relevant law 8 the parties\u2019 agreement to bifurcate the threshold issue and their opposing cases, engages the court in determining if it will exercise its powers pursuant to section 90rd of the act and if so, what declaration it will make. this in turn requires consideration of section 4aa of the act, which provides for the meaning of \u201cde facto relationship\u201d, and relevant authorities. 9 section 4aa provides: working out if persons have a relationship as a couple (1) a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if: a person is in a de facto relationship with another person if: the persons are not legally married to each other, and (b) the persons are not related by family (see subsection (6)), and (c) having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis. paragraph (c) has effect subject to subsection (5). having regard to all the circumstances of their relationship, they have a relationship as a couple living together on a genuine domestic basis. those circumstances may include any or all of the following: the duration of the relationship, (b) the nature and extent of their common residence, (c) whether a sexual relationship exists, (d) the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, (e) the ownership, use and acquisition of their property, (f) the degree of mutual commitment to a shared life, (g) whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, (h) the care and support of children, (i) the reputation and public aspects of the relationship. (3) no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. (4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case. the degree of financial dependence or interdependence, and any arrangements for financial support, between them, whether the relationship is or was registered under a prescribed law of a state or territory as a prescribed kind of relationship, no particular finding in relation to any circumstance is to be regarded as necessary in deciding whether the persons have a de facto relationship. (4) a court determining whether a de facto relationship exists is entitled to have regard to such matters, and to attach such weight to any matter, as may seem appropriate to the court in the circumstances of the case. for the purposes of this act: (a) a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and (b) a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship. a de facto relationship can exist between 2 persons of different sexes and between 2 persons of the same sex, and (b) a de facto relationship can exist even if one of the persons is legally married to someone else or in another de facto relationship. 10 in jonah & white [2011] famca 221, murphy j gave guidance in assessing the facts of a case against the factors outlined in section 4aa of the act, stating: 11 the complexity of the assessment of relevant facts and factors in section 4aa was the subject of judicial guidance in crowley & pappas [2013] famca 783, where tree j said at [8]: those provisions, or their state counterparts, have been the subject of considerable judicial discussion, principally in an attempt to more precisely analyse what will comprise \u201ca couple\u201d. much of that analysis seems to have its genesis in the difficulty in satisfactorily distilling the essence of such a common, everyday concept. from those decisions the following propositions may be stated: (a) whether a de facto relationship exists or not is a question of fact, not a matter of discretion, (b) a de facto relationship does not need to be akin to a marriage although the nature of the association involved in a marriage relationship may be instructive, (c) the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time, whether a de facto relationship exists or not is a question of fact, not a matter of discretion, (b) a de facto relationship does not need to be akin to a marriage although the nature of the association involved in a marriage relationship may be instructive, (c) the parties determine the nature of their relationship and it may evolve and alter, even dramatically, over time, there need not be full time living together, (e) the relationship may be unhappy, but still subsisting, (f) sexual or other exclusivity is not necessary, (g) the gist of the inquiry is the degree to which parties have merged their lives into one. that connotes financial, emotional and physical interdependence. [footnotes omitted] the gist of the inquiry is the degree to which parties have merged their lives into one. that connotes financial, emotional and physical interdependence. 12 generally, the onus of establishing the fact that parties were in a de facto relationship will be on the party asserting that fact on the balance of probabilities.[5] 13 whether a de facto relationship existed and, if so, when it commenced and ended is a matter for determination on the facts, although the perceptions of the parties may be relevant to this.[6] the fact finding required is somewhat complicated when the parties have different perceptions and their perceptions may be motivated by a desire to achieve particular outcomes. recent examples of this difficulty are tomson & maclaren[7] and baden & packwood.[8] the applicant\u2019s evidence 14 the applicant\u2019s affidavit filed 9 may 2021 was read into evidence and she was cross-examined. the substance of her evidence was that she commenced her relationship with the respondent in 2012 and they began cohabiting as a couple in april 2013. she said they lived sometimes at her family home, being the b street, town c property, and at other times at the respondent\u2019s parents\u2019 home in suburb e. 15 the applicant said that in 2014 the respondent \u201cmoved into\u201d her father's property on a permanent basis and did not pay rent or contribute to utilities such as the electricity bill or food. 16 the applicant gave evidence that the respondent commenced fly in fly out (\u201cfifo\u201d) work in queensland in about 2014. under cross examination, she agreed that the work entailed 28 days away from tasmania and seven days back in tasmania. 17 the applicant\u2019s case is that from at least 2014 when the respondent moved into b street, town c property and until 2016, she and the respondent lived together on a bone fide domestic basis. she was not cross-examined in much detail as to the arrangements in this period, which are set out in her affidavit filed 9 may 2021 at paragraphs 6 to 9. this evidence was: 6. during the relationship i provided the greater amount of household and domestic duties, i also assisted with the upkeep of the property by feeding the animals and livestock and performing harrowing work. i would attend to on most occasions, general housework, cooking, cleaning, washing both my clothes & [the respondent\u2019s] and including his work wear. i would hang his clothes on the line to dry, vacuum, clean the dishes amongst other things. 7. from 2014 [the respondent] would fly interstate for work a lot as he was doing fifo work. once i obtained my driver\u2019s licence (i believe on or about 2016) i would almost always pick [the respondent] from the airport when he returned and drive him to the airport when he departed. for approximately the first year of [the respondent\u2019s] fifo work we would most of the time stay at his mother\u2019s house, the night before [the respondent] departed interstate for work as it was less of a drive to the airport than from b street, town c, where we lived. the times we stayed at his mother\u2019s house for this purpose i would see him off and [the respondent\u2019s] father or mother would drive me home to b street, town c. 8. from about 2015 [the respondent] would mainly stay at b street, town c when he was flying interstate from work. from the date i obtained my driver\u2019s licence i almost always drove [the respondent] to the airport or picked him up. 9. when we were living at b street, town c together, we shared a bedroom. [the respondent] would have his clothing and personal possessions in the bedroom as would i. 18 the applicant says that throughout the relationship right up until 2019, the parties had a sexual relationship, sharing a bedroom for the entire time, even when their relationship was tested due to infidelity. the applicant was not challenged about this evidence in cross-examination. 19 at paragraph 16 of the applicant\u2019s affidavit filed 9 may 2021, she explains how the property came to be sold to the respondent alone rather than jointly between them. she stated that the respondent had proposed that she not be registered as a co-owner of the b street, town c property so as to enable her to seek a government grant for a future purchase of property. she was not challenged in respect of that evidence. 20 there was detailed evidence given about how the applicant\u2019s father sold the property to the respondent at below market value and further gifted $20,000 of the value of the purchase price to enable the respondent to secure finance to purchase the property. 21 the applicant acknowledges that the parties \u201cbroke up\u201d in 2016 when she discovered that the respondent was secretly seeing and having sex with her best friend.[9] 22 the applicant said that she and the respondent mutually shared each other\u2019s vehicles throughout the entire period up until 2019 and that they shared the care of the animals on the b street, town c property. again, the applicant was not challenged in relation to any of this evidence. 23 regarding the financial arrangements of the parties during their relationship, the applicant agreed that she earned less than the respondent and she frankly admitted that she did not personally make substantial financial contribution to the property acquired during the relationship. however, she referred to the significant assistance given by her father, as stated at paragraph 27 of her affidavit. 24 the applicant agreed that the parties always had separate bank accounts, but maintained that they shared day-to-day expenses. this was not equal sharing as the respondent had a greater income and paid the mortgage and council rates. 25 the respondent paid for some of the applicant\u2019s personal expenses when she was not able to afford these and the applicant lived at the b street, town c property making very modest contribution to the outgoings related to the property right up until 2019. there was evidence of payments to and from the parties\u2019 bank accounts and this appears to have continued after the time that the respondent alleges that the parties separated. 26 the applicant said that the property at b street, town c was acquired because the parties both wanted a shared life. she conceded under cross-examination that she did not want children, while the respondent did. however, she added that the b street, town c property permitted them to own animals, which were a common interest. she implied by her evidence that their shared work on the farm was demonstrative of their meaningful and mutual commitment. 27 despite the evidence referred to a [26], the applicant admitted that she had a sexual encounter with mr d in 2014. the explanation for the encounter given by the applicant is that she was missing the respondent who was working fifo at the time, and she was unhappy. she stated that she had been entirely open and honest with the respondent about the encounter and the communications mr d sought to initiate with her afterwards. 28 it is clear from evidence before the court that the sexual encounter between the applicant and mr d was a source of the grievance for the respondent. there was evidence that in 2015 the respondent wounded mr d, faced criminal charges concerning that offence, and both parties sought restraint orders against mr d. 29 the applicant\u2019s affidavit contains evidence about the public nature of the relationship and their activities as a couple.[10] this evidence was not challenged in cross-examination although some parts of the affidavit material constituting hearsay and opinion was struck out and i have not had regard to it.[11] 30 at the commencement of the hearing, counsel for the applicant sought to tender into evidence a bundle of texts messages between the applicant and respondent. after hearing submissions i ruled that the text messages would be received in evidence.[12] i gave separate reasons for that ruling and offered the respondent and his counsel further time to consider these and prepare to respond to them before the hearing continued. the offer was declined. the authenticity of the messages exchanged was conceded by the respondent. 31 the text messages relate to the period 7 august 2018 to 14 june 2019 when the respondent was doing fifo work. they can only be described as prolific and very frequent communications between the parties, relating to normal issues arising in day-to-day life when persons share a joint domestic life as a couple. for example: referring to break down or malfunction of equipment on the property, feeding/caring for animals, what the parties would be doing during the day, the applicant's health and treatments and paying for this, the respondent\u2019s work and what he was doing, flight times and arranging his collection from the airport. the messages also included some expressions of love. 32 cross examination of the applicant was mainly directed to what the applicant had declared about the nature of the relationship to various public entities, centrelink, the australian taxation office, on facebook and when she presented for medical treatment to the f hospital in may 2017. 33 regarding her declarations to centrelink, the applicant stated she could not recall if she had stated that she was \u201csingle\u201d. it was put to her that she received benefits, but would not have been eligible if she had declared that she was in a de facto relationship with the respondent. the applicant maintained that she could not recall what declaration she had made and did not concede she would not have received benefits. 34 the applicant stated she did not know what her relationship status had been declared to be in her tax returns, and that the respondent prepared all of her returns. as to the f hospital notes referring to her as single in may 2017,[13] the applicant stated that she was very unwell psychiatrically and had reported what she felt at the time, having recently been told by the respondent that he loved somebody else, namely ms g. 35 the applicant stated that the relationship with the respondent was repaired after this time and the parties reconciled. it was put to the applicant that the relationship was over one year prior to the may 2017 hospital presentation and she disputed this. 36 when cross-examined about a text message which she sent to the respondent containing a facebook post and a comment \u201c3 years not together\u201d,[14] the applicant stated that it felt like they had not been together and that is what she meant. it was directly put to her that they had not been together and she denied this. she stated that they acted like a couple and slept together, and that it was not until she found out about the affair in 2019 that the relationship ended.[15] 37 during cross examination, the applicant agreed that she had access to the respondent's credit card up until 2016, but not after that time. when it was put to the applicant that the parties had not had much of a shared life after 2016, with the respondent away a lot and each having sexual relations with others, the applicant maintained that she only learnt about the respondent's other affairs later and that she had only slept with one person after they reconciled in 2016, being mr h. 38 it was put to the applicant that she wanted a shared life, but that the respondent would not commit to that. the applicant said that the respondent put forward to her that he wanted a shared a life with her but what he did with others behind closed doors was different. 39 it is evident from cross-examination of the applicant about how the respondent came to be the owner of the b street, town c property that she is extremely bitter, and that she feels angry and used. she openly admitted as much. 40 the applicant was asked why she had not called her brother mr j to give evidence in the case, given that he also lived at the b street, town c property for all of the time she claims to have been in a de facto relationship with the respondent. her answer was that \u201cthey want him to stay out of it\u201d. it was not clarified as to whether that included the respondent or merely the applicant and her brother. 41 in re-examination, the applicant gave evidence that after they broke up in 2016, the parties reconciled in january 2017. when i sought clarification about this, the applicant stated that the respondent had initiated this reconciliation. when asked what the respondent had done, she said that he had bought the dogs to help \u201cfix\u201d the relationship, that he made an effort to spend time with her, to go out together more, and they talked a lot about what had happened. i took this to mean what had happened regarding infidelity in their relationship. 42 the applicant was re-examined about whether the parties\u2019 relationship resumed after the may 2017 hospital admission. she said they had resumed the relationship \u201ca couple of weeks later\u201d. she was asked what occurred at this time that demonstrated the resumption of the relationship, but did not recall specifically. 43 the applicant called two other witnesses: ms k and ms l. their affidavits were read into evidence subject to parts struck out on the basis that they were either hearsay or conclusions. otherwise, their evidence did not alter from that contained in their affidavits and each conceded that they were close friends of the applicant when cross-examined. in the case of ms l, cross-examination revealed that she held strong views that the respondent had treated the applicant badly. the respondent\u2019s evidence 44 the respondent relied upon his trial affidavit and a tender bundle of documents filed on 7 may 2021. in substance his evidence was that the parties lived together as a couple on a genuine domestic basis only from august 2016 to october 2016, but were otherwise in a casual relationship. 45 the respondent said that from 1 march 2012 to 8 april 2016 he considered the applicant to be his \u201cgirlfriend\u201d. he agreed that they had a sexual relationship throughout this time. 46 as to the financial arrangements prior to 2016, the respondent gave evidence under cross examination that he earned the greater income, they maintained separate bank accounts, they did not purchase joint property, and did not incur joint liabilities except for a credit card which he provided to the applicant in her name and which he was responsible for paying off. further, that they each kept items which they purchased. 47 he said that during the period referred to at [45] he loaned money to the applicant, which one some occasions was repaid and not on others, and that they transferred money between their respective bank accounts. he accepted that he transferred the applicant money for personal expenses such as her phone bill and health insurance premiums. 48 the factors at [45] to [47] were again put to the respondent in terms of the period august 2016 to october 2016, being when he accepts that the parties were in a genuine domestic relationship, his evidence was about those factors were the same. 49 the respondent denied preparing all the applicant\u2019s tax returns, and said that he had assisted her with \u201cone or two of them\u201d. 50 questions were put to the respondent about where the parties lived between march 2012 and august 2016, to which he responded in summary that they shared a bedroom at their respective parents\u2019 houses for a total of one to two nights each week, and did not pay any money to either parents. he did not accept that one to two nights a week was inconsistent with his affidavit filed 10 august 2020 at paragraph [32] of his affidavit, the respondent stated: 32. when i resided at suburb e with my parents, i had a self-contained area in the downstairs part of the house which i also paid for my power consumption and cooked for myself. during the relationship period of 2012-2016 the applicant would stay with me at both of my parents\u2019 houses. this would be for a couple of nights in each week, sometimes more, sometimes not at all. 33. when the applicant did stay with me she did not financially contribute to any living expenses and if we did not eat with my parents then i would do the cooking for us. on the occasions i would stay with the applicant and her father at b street, town c i would cook dinner for them both and her brother mr j on regular occasions at my own expense. my stays at b street, town c were also only for one of two nights at a time in any given week. 51 the respondent gave evidence that he undertook fifo work in queensland and western australia between march 2012 and august 2016, consisting of 28 days away and either seven or eight days in tasmania. this accords with paragraph 23 of his affidavit filed 7 may 2020. 52 the respondent was questioned about text messages sent between the parties in 2018.[16] he accepted that the parties continued to communicate regularly while he was doing fifo and was away. he agreed that the contents of discussions included the respondent offering money to the applicant for her expenses, arrangements for the applicant to collect the respondent from the airport, going out for dinner together, and tasks being performed at the b street, town c property in his absence. 53 in his affidavit filed 7 may 2021, the respondent affirmed that: 104. following separation there were occasions when [the applicant] and i had sex. this occurred occasionally. on some occasions, sex was initiated by me and on others, by [the applicant]. several times after this occurred, we spoke about the fact that is was \u201cjust sex\u201d and that we both remained single, and we were not reconciling. 54 under cross-examination, the respondent stated that the conversation that they were not reconciling occurred on each occasion they had sex after october 2016. his evidence was that they remained single and were both free to pursue other relationships. 55 it was put to the respondent that when the applicant questioned the respondent about whether he has had sex with another person,[17] he did not say words to the effect of \u201ci\u2019m single. i can sleep with whomever i want\u201d. the respondent agreed he had not said that. 56 under cross examination the respondent maintained his claim that from october 2016 to june 2019 the parties were not presenting publically as a couple. 57 he was questioned about various references to the respondent as the applicant\u2019s \u2018partner\u2019 and \u2018boyfriend\u2019 in f hospital records concerning the applicant\u2019s admission on 7 april 2017.[18] he stated the term had not been term used in his presence. he then conceded that he was present at the hospital with the applicant, although his evidence initially was that he only drove there later to take her home. 58 during evidence in chief, the respondent said in reference to an entry on 17 january 2016 when the medical records noted that the applicant was \u201cdischarged home with partner\u201d he was in town m. 59 several documents from the criminal proceedings during 2015 which contain references to the applicant as the respondent\u2019s partner[19] were put to the respondent in cross-examination. the respondent stated that the documents were not written by him, and that he had identified the applicant to the authors as his girlfriend. he paused before answering when asked what he meant by the term \u2018girlfriend\u2019 and how this differed from \u2018partner\u2019. after a long pause, his evidence was that he interpreted the documents to be referring to the applicant as his girlfriend and he was \u201cjust not sure\u201d how to clarify the difference those terms. he stated that he recalled the use of the term \u2018partner\u2019 in passing sentence and did not dispute the reference. 60 the respondent was also taken to the statutory declaration[20] in support of the application for restraint order against mr d,[21] in which the applicant is referred to by him as his \u2018partner\u2019. his evidence was that the parties discussed seeking restraint orders and that he paid the lawyer who drafted the documents. from this it can be inferred that the respondent gave instructions as to the content of the documents and approved of them. 61 his evidence was that his firearms were transferred to his father before his licence was cancelled as a result of the wounding conviction and that they were not stored long-term at the b street, town c property but at his parents\u2019 house. 62 the respondent confirmed that he initially leased a portion of the b street, town c property from the applicant\u2019s father under a verbal agreement from may 2015, and then later purchased the whole property. this had been earlier refuted by the applicant when she was cross examined. 63 the respondent\u2019s evidence about his purchase of the b street, town c property in 2016 is:[22] i was interested in purchasing the property as i enjoyed the farming aspect. i was earning good money undertaking the fifo work and was looking to buy a property. [the applicant\u2019s father] said he would sell it to me as he was keen to leave the property. i organised for a valuation of the property to be undertaking in november 2015. the property was valued at $340,000 by company n... 64 in his affidavit filed 7 may 2021, the respondent listed various documents mailed to him at his mother\u2019s address as evidence that he lived there prior to his purchase of the b street, town c property.[23] he accepted under cross-examination that he had not provided a similar list or copies of examples of mail sent to him after the purchase to provide contrast. 65 the respondent gave evidence about a pre-purchase valuation of the b street, town c property in 2015, stating he had organised it and the report was sent to his email address. 66 the respondent accepted that the initial purchase price of the b street, town c property was $340,000 as the value shown in the valuation,[24] but he was unable to obtain finance at that price. the respondent said that applicant\u2019s father had a contact to purchase another property and needed the funds to complete that purchase, so he made a non-refundable gift of $20,000 to allow the respondent to obtain finance. 67 the respondent gave evidence that horses at the b street, town c property were owned by the applicant, but admitted that he purchased a horse float, which the applicant used until she left the property in 2019. he also owned a tractor and trailer which the applicant used daily to feed the horses between october 2016 and 2019. he added that she also used them to feed the respondent\u2019s cows, and conceded that she probably performed harrowing work as this would be expected after animals were moved on. 68 in regards to his relationship with ms g in may 2017, the respondent\u2019s evidence was that when the applicant asked where he was going, he told her that he was \u201cgoing out for dinner or for a date\u201d. he denied using a more ambiguous phrasing, but that he has no specific recollection as to whether he told the applicant whom he was meeting. he agreed that he was at dinner with ms g on 23 may 2017 and that he has a vague recollection of receiving text messages from the applicant asking as to his whereabouts. he recalls the applicant sending him photos of herself after self-harming and that she was subsequently admitted to hospital. 69 in regards to ms o, his evidence was that in june 2019 while he and the applicant were still living at the b street, town c property the applicant accused him of having sex with another woman, which the respondent denied. it was put to him that the applicant said words to the effect that \u201cyou\u2019ve cheated on me again\u201d, the respondent said he could not recall, but agreed he told the applicant to leave the b street, town c property, which she did soon after. 70 counsel for the applicant questioned the respondent about his messages with mr h during may 2017.[25] it was put to him that they were having a conversation about the applicant cheating on the respondent with mr h and there could only be \u201ccheating\" if the applicant and the respondent were in a relationship. the respondent denied this. 71 the respondent called two other witnesses: his mother ms p (\u201cthe respondent\u2019s mother\u201d) and his father mr q (\u201cthe respondent\u2019s father\u201d). both filed affidavits on 7 may 2021, which were read into evidence. 72 in her affidavit, the respondent\u2019s mother outlined the history of the applicant and respondent\u2019s relationship, as she was aware of it, and detailed the times at which the respondent lived at her home. her evidence was that she and the applicant exchanged text messages up to and throughout 2019, including arranging for the applicant to collect belongings from the respondent\u2019s parents\u2019 house in 2019. the evidence of the respondent\u2019s mother does not particularly assist the court in determining the existence or duration of a de facto relationship as it related to snapshots within a long period. 73 the contents of the respondent\u2019s father\u2019s affidavit is largely consistent with that of the respondent\u2019s mother. he was questioned about the respondent\u2019s purchase of cows in 2015, and a period in 2018 during which the respondent was recovering from a relapse of a medical condition. his evidence does not assist the court in determining the existence or duration of a de facto relationship either, as it is apparent that he and the respondent\u2019s mother did not have continuous contact about or personal knowledge of things that occurred in their son\u2019s day to day life. findings and determination 74 having carefully listened to and observed the parties during the hearing, there was a distinct difference in their evidence. the applicant was very open and unreserved in answering questions put to her, conceding matters even where they were contrary to her case. for example, the evidence she gave about her attitude to how the respondent had the come to own the b street, town c property. 75 by contrast, the respondent was at times quite hesitant in answering questions and his answers under cross-examination were guarded and appeared somewhat rehearsed. he was reluctant to make reasonable concessions about evidence unhelpful to his case. the most obvious example was, when questioned by me as to the apparent continuity of the features common to a de facto relationship after the period of time at which the respondent asserted there was separation in 2016, the respondent was unable to answer for a very lengthy period of time. he was unable to provide an answer as to why he regarded the de facto relationship existed in the period in 2016, but not after. 76 although allowance is made for the fact that witnesses giving evidence before a court are often nervous, stressed, and uncomfortable due to the unfamiliar process and surroundings, i am of the view that the respondent was not deliberately obfuscating, but could not reconcile the apparent illogicality drawn to his attention. 77 ultimately, based on my assessment of the parties\u2019 evidence, i have no hesitation in concluding that where the evidence of the applicant and respondent conflicts, i ought to prefer the evidence of the applicant. in arriving at this conclusion, i have carefully considered the often cited statements at [165] to [167] in carlson & fluvium [2012] famca 32. 78 in addition, there are a number of documents before the court in which respondent uses or adopts the description of the applicant as his partner. i believe as contemporaneous records of occurrences in time, they reflect what is on the evidence a relationship as a couple on a bone fide domestic basis and not that they were in a casual boyfriend/girlfriend relationship. 79 the respondent\u2019s evidence that he regarded the parties to be in a casual boyfriend/girlfriend relationship is a subjective perception and i give it very little weight as the objective hallmark features of a de facto relationship are established on the evidence. 80 preferring the reliability of the applicant's evidence where it conflicts with that of the respondent, i make the following findings of fact concerning the section 4aa(2) considerations: (a) the parties were in a relationship and shared all facets of day to day life together at the b street, town c property from late 2014 to june 2019, although this period was briefly interrupted by very short periods of separation on two occasions and then reconciliations, (b) during the period referred to above at (a), the parties resided commonly at the b street, town c property, which was owned by the applicant\u2019s father initially but then purchased by the respondent in 2016 in his name for the parties\u2019 joint use as a home. when the respondent was absent doing fifo work, he still maintained it as his home with the applicant and she undertook chores and housework for his benefit, (c) the parties had a sexual relationship throughout the period 2014 to 2019, although it was not a continuously exclusive sexual relationship, as each of them had sexual encounters with others, (d) the parties earned income and provided financially for themselves to a degree, but the respondent provided financial support to the applicant who was financially dependent on him, (e) during the period referred to above at (a), the parties expressed love for each other at various times throughout as would be commonly expected of a couple in a committed relationship as a couple, (f) the parties each referred to the other as their \u2018partner\u2019, and (g) they socialised as a couple and were regarded as such by the witnesses called by the applicant. it is notable that the respondent did not call friends or associates to rebut this evidence. the evidence of the respondent\u2019s parents is not especially helpful for the reasons referred to at [72] and [73] of these reasons. the parties were in a relationship and shared all facets of day to day life together at the b street, town c property from late 2014 to june 2019, although this period was briefly interrupted by very short periods of separation on two occasions and then reconciliations, (b) during the period referred to above at (a), the parties resided commonly at the b street, town c property, which was owned by the applicant\u2019s father initially but then purchased by the respondent in 2016 in his name for the parties\u2019 joint use as a home. when the respondent was absent doing fifo work, he still maintained it as his home with the applicant and she undertook chores and housework for his benefit, (c) the parties had a sexual relationship throughout the period 2014 to 2019, although it was not a continuously exclusive sexual relationship, as each of them had sexual encounters with others, (d) the parties earned income and provided financially for themselves to a degree, but the respondent provided financial support to the applicant who was financially dependent on him, (e) during the period referred to above at (a), the parties expressed love for each other at various times throughout as would be commonly expected of a couple in a committed relationship as a couple, (f) the parties each referred to the other as their \u2018partner\u2019, and (g) they socialised as a couple and were regarded as such by the witnesses called by the applicant. it is notable that the respondent did not call friends or associates to rebut this evidence. the evidence of the respondent\u2019s parents is not especially helpful for the reasons referred to at [72] and [73] of these reasons. 81 the respondent solely owns the b street, town c property, but i accept that the likely reason for that is consistent with the applicant\u2019s evidence. the respondent presented as a driven person with goals of owning a farming property and maximising financial security for the couple. this is consistent with the observations of those who provided references at the time of the wounding prosecution and the applicant referring work to his business. the parties also both used and occupied the property for their mutual interest in farming and caring for animals. 82 although the parties had tumultuous periods involving infidelity and short separations, they persisted together as a couple and cohabited on a bona fide domestic basis at the b street, town c property. this persistence in the face of infidelities that each felt and expressed, demonstrated a mutual commitment to a shared life. the applicant was very frank about the impact of the respondent\u2019s infidelities, but the respondent was not. despite this, his conduct at the time of being aware of them plainly conveys he was hurt or at least aggrieved, which would not be objectively expected if they were not in a committed partnership as a couple.[26] 83 when the respondent was absent from the property and from tasmania while he worked on a fifo basis, he clearly maintained a close connection and commitment to the applicant, as is evidenced by the extensive volume and nature of the communications they had.[27] they reflect much more than a mere matters of practical convenience between two persons sharing a property. 84 the evidence called by the applicant from her friends, although somewhat and not unexpectedly favouring the applicant, is consistent with other evidence before the court as to how the parties portrayed themselves publically, including records relating to the wounding proceedings, police prosecution, magistrates court restraint order documents and the f hospital. it is notable that the respondent did not call any witnesses to contradict evidence about the public aspect of the parties\u2019 relationship. instead, he chose to adopt an explanation that \u201cpartner\u201d simply meant \u201cgirlfriend\u201d. 85 counsel for the respondent made a submission that i should draw an adverse inference about the evidence that the applicant\u2019s brother would have given as to the nature of the relationship between the applicant and respondent at various times.[28] i am not prepared to do so. as noted, there was no clarification about who \u201cwe\u201d referred to in the evidence the applicant gave as noted at [40] above. as the respondent knew mr j well also, \u201cwe\u201d may have been a reference to the parties and the respondent has not called him either. 86 guided the by the provisions in subsections 4aa(3) and 4aa(4) and also the legal principles referred to at [10] \u2013 [13], the above findings lead me to the conclusion that the parties were in a de facto relationship for the period late 2014 to june 2019. the two brief separations (during which they remained living at b street, town c) do not prevent this conclusion.[29] the separations marginally reduce the overall duration of the de facto relationship by probably around four to six months, doing the best i can based on the evidence given by the applicant. 87 cross examination of the applicant about it being her desire not the respondent\u2019s to have a shared life was directed to demonstrating that the parties likely had different perceptions and the applicant was mistaken that they had such a life. but, this case is not one to be determined or particularly influenced on the basis of perceptions, noting the factual findings made and reasons for them. 88 ultimately, although it was put to the applicant that she wished to have a mutual shared life, but the respondent did not, despite what statements the respondent made for the purposes of these proceedings, the manner in which both parties conducted themselves and acted overwhelmingly conveyed that even in the face of infidelity and absence due to the respondent working on a fifo basis, both parties maintained their commitment to their relationship as a couple residing in a home together on a bone fide domestic basis until the respondent told the applicant to leave the b street, town c property in 2019. it was only at that time that the relationship as a couple ended. 89 for all the foregoing reasons, i am satisfied that the parties were in a de facto relationship within the meaning of section 4aa of the act for a period of approximately 4 years and 6 months. accordingly a declaration is made pursuant to section 90rd(2) of the act in such terms.

which may arise if the child concerned is exposed to any kind of abuse, neglect and family violence. assessment of risk the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term \u2018unacceptable risk\u2019. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable. it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children\u2019s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children\u2019s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent\u2019s ability to care for the children. relocation whilst the statutory framework does not deal differently or specifically with cases involving a proposed relocation from other parenting cases, such cases attract the description of \u201crelocation cases\u201d because they bring into sharp focus the central issue of balancing statutory imperatives concerning children\u2019s best interests in the context of the legitimate and competing interests of parents. the task is to achieve, by the application of the law, orders which are legitimate by reference to both \u201cbest interests\u201d considerations and the rights of parents, including a right to choose where the parent lives. in some cases, the determination of \u201cbest interests\u201d may well mean that one party\u2019s choice is effectively outweighed in the balance. alternatively, proper balancing may result in the child\u2019s \u201cbest interests\u201d being served by orders which do not give one parent \u201coptimal\u201d arrangements or outcomes.[40] conclusion associate: dated: 27 october 2023 dated: 27 october 2023 [1] family law act 1975 (cth) s

have been identified require a court have a principled reason for interfering with the existing legal and equitable interests of the parties to the marriage and whatever may have been their stated or unstated assumptions and agreements about property interest during the continuance of the marriage. [42] in many cases where an application is made for property settlement order, the just and equitable requirement is readily satisfied by observing that, as the result of a choice by made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife. no less importantly, the express implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship... and the assumption that any adjustment of those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4), mr cortes\u2019 letter with the promise to [ms almeer], if you deport money into my savings account with the [k bank] i promise that i will not touch this money. i promise that i am not in this relationship for the money. i am completely in love with you and i want to help and support you and [e].

[36] that principle has a counterpart in the application factors prescribed in section 75(2) or section 90sm(3) of the act. any adjustment to the parties contribution-based- entitlements should be determined inclusively after considering all relevant factors, not by aggregating incremental adjustment in respect of each relevant factor. [citations omitted] in our view, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred in proceedings pursuant to the provisions of s 79 that moneys howsoever received by a party during the course of the parties' cohabitation, are used by that party for the benefit of the family unit. such moneys, in those circumstances, thus constitute a financial contribution by the party who received the moneys. step three: section 90sf(3) factors ...in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue. on our adjusted figure for the value of the parties net assets ($1,503,863), adjustment of 10% in the wife\u2019s favour results in an increase in her entitlement of $150,386, and a corresponding reduction in the husband\u2019s entitlement, producing a differential movement between them of $300,772 ... 7] it is also important to recall what was said in phipson & phipson [2009] famcafc 28 when the full court was dealing with another appeal from the trial judge in the present proceedings: ] it is always important to keep in mind that an adjustment of x% for s 75(2) factors leads to a disparity in the value of property received by the parties representing 2 x x%. it is that disparity, measured in \u201cmoney terms\u201d, that requires consideration in determining whether the result is just and equitable: see campbell v kuskey [1998] famca 10, (1998) flc 92-795 at 84,928. 8] the 10% adjustment his honour made on account of s 75(2) factors has led to a disparity in favour of the wife equivalent in value to 20% of the assets. in money terms this represents $187,733 out of a total asset pool of $938,665. apart from the issues associated with the care, accommodation and maintenance of the children, the s 75(2) factors largely balanced out (save that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife would have more capital than the husband). the husband was going to have whatever responsibility remained for the care, accommodation and maintenance of j. both parties would have significant responsibility for the two younger children. it is true the wife will have the children with her about 20% more of the time than the husband, but this amounts to only a little more than 70 additional days a year. [109] in our view an assessment leading to a disparity of $187,733 in the capital/superannuation to be received by each party was outside the reasonable ambit of the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion, even taking into account the matters found by his honour relating to the non-payment of child support in the period after the husband gave up his employment. our conclusion is sufficient to enliven appellate intervention (house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513). the appeal will therefore be allowed. ... [113] taking these matters into account, and the failure of the husband to pay child support after giving up his employment, we consider there should be a 4% adjustment for s 75(2) factors, creating a disparity of 8% between the parties \u2013 or in money terms an amount of $75,093. 9] in our view, s 79(4)(e) requires those matters to be taken into account in arriving at orders that are just and equitable as between the parties. in arriving at an appropriate assessment for those factors, a dollar value of it should be uppermost in our minds [79] and, of course, the ultimate disparity in entitlements which it might produce. that dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests in property of the parties. discussion of section 90sf(3) factors age and state of health income, property, financial resources and capacity for employment care of children under 18 years commitments of each of the parties to support themselves or a child responsibilities of either party to support any other person entitlement to a means tested pension reasonable standard of living would maintenance assist education or training effect on creditors effect party contributed to the earning capacity and property of the other whether party cohabiting with another person any fact or circumstances required to take into account reflection on submissions realistic prospect of refinance chaos added to mr cortes\u2019 legal costs consequence/effect of proposed orders mr cortes\u2019 modest additional income after separation the extant interim orders all in orders sought ms almeer has the use of e\u2019s interest act not about compensation conclusion as to section 90sf(3) adjustment step four: conclusion and just and equitable orders costs 117 costs subject to subsection (2), subsections 45a(6) and 70nfb(1) and sections 117aa and 117ac, each party to proceedings under this act shall bear his or her own costs.

[27] there is an inherent tension between, on the one hand, separated parents being able to establish new homes wherever they like and, on the other, their restraint by injunction from living too far apart to avoid any impingement of their children\u2019s ability to retain meaningful relationships with both parents. the conflict is between the best interests of the children to know and have regular personal contact with each parent and the interests of the parents to enjoy a high measure of freedom of movement which is not lost by reason only of their parental responsibility for the children (see ams v aif (1999) 199 clr 160 (\u201cams v aif\u201d) at 196, 206, 207-208, 210). the tension at the intersection of those conflicting interests is even greater when an order is sought, not just to restrain one parent\u2019s move further away, but to compel the parent who has already moved away to return and establish a new residence closer to the other parent. [28] while the children\u2019s interests are paramount, their interests are not the sole determinant of parenting orders under part vii of the act (ams v aif at 207, 225, 230, u v u [2002] hca 36, (2002) 211 clr 238 (\u201cu v u\u201d) at 282). parents enjoy as much freedom to live where they please as is compatible with their obligations pertaining to the children (see ams v aif at 223-224, 231-232, sampson and hartnett (no.10) [2007] famca 1365, (2007) flc 93-350, zanda & zanda [2014] famcafc 173, (2014) flc 93-607 at [132]- [136]). only when the children\u2019s welfare would be adversely affected must a parent\u2019s right to freedom of mobility defer to the paramount consideration of the children\u2019s best interests (see u v u at 262). ] it may be accepted, as it was in this case, that the court has power to make a coercive order. importantly though, it is well established that the proper exercise of that power is \u201cat the extreme end of the discretionary range\u201d and there should exist \u201crare\u201d or \u201cextreme\u201d factors that warrant the court exercising its discretion to make a coercive order requiring a parent to relocate so as to continue to perform the role of primary caregiver of children. citations omitted. conclusion associate: dated: 2 november 2023 dated: 2 november 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "1195.txt", "size": 26228, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 26453, "document_id": "1195"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "1195_chunk_0"}}

[b\u2019s] care arrangements he will maintain a sense of primary residency in one household and this could provide an opportunity for [the mother] and [b] to re-establish spending more meaningful time together. however, [b] has clearly reported feeling frustrated and unsettled within this arrangement. should no changes be made [b] will likely feel unheard and as though his wishes are not being respected. this would increase the risk of [b] \u2018voting with his feet\u2019 and becoming increasingly defiant. if [b\u2019s] care arrangements change to a week about arrangement [b\u2019s] sense of primary residency and associated stability would be lost. it could also work to undermine [b\u2019s] relationship with [the mother] and strain this relationship further. this arrangement also runs the risk of a week about arrangement commencing but possibly deteriorating to [b] spending less and less time with his mother. conversely, the benefit of this arrangement would be that it aligns with what [b] currently wants, and with [b] feeling heard and understood he is more likely to be open to following the order and could possibly provide him with a sense of peace as well as having increased access to [the father] who [b] identified as a trusting and understanding person. nevertheless, there are clear challenges and vulnerabilities with both of these possible outcomes. both of these pathways do potentially lead to the same outcome of an emerging resist-refuse dynamic in which [b] may cease spending time with [the mother] in favour of living with [the father] aligned with his current care preference. father: i liked to know what mum said [b]: i can text you what she said she didn\u2019t say much father ok all she said is that \u201cyour dad wants this to go on for longer in court so we\u2019re going to trial\u201d something like that father: wow, what lies [b]: yep father: she has caused all of this. she could have just agreed to what you want. but she won\u2019t.

doubt, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, the court may make an order under subsection (2) as to costs or security for costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, to the effect that each party to the proceedings bears, in such proportion as the court considers just, the costs of the independent children's lawyer in respect of the proceedings. however, in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer for a child has been appointed, if: (a) a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer, a party to the proceedings has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings, or (b) the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer, the court considers that a party to the proceedings would suffer financial hardship if the party had to bear a proportion of the costs of the independent children's lawyer, the court must not make an order under subsection (2) against that party in relation to the costs of the independent children's lawyer. ) [omitted] in considering what order (if any) should be made under subsection (2) in proceedings in which an independent children's lawyer has been appointed, the court must disregard the fact that the independent children's lawyer is funded under a legal aid scheme or service established under a commonwealth, state or territory law or approved by the attorney-general.\u201d ... while i am satisfied there is merit in making an order against the mother that she pay one-half of the costs as sought by the icl, i am also satisfied that i am prevented by s.117(4) from doing so because she is \u201ca party to the proceedings [who] has received legal aid in respect of the proceedings\u201d. whether this was the policy intent of the parliament when it amended this provision in 2003 is a moot point and not one upon which this court proposes to comment further. that said, i am satisfied that had the costs order sought against the mother been legally possible, she would not suffer financial hardship ... in construing the subsection it should be observed that the operative circumstance is unqualified. it does not suggest that the party must currently be in receipt of legal aid, or in receipt of legal aid for a particular portion of the proceedings. it is expressed simply in the past tense. ... in relation to both the mother and the father in these proceedings, whether, considering the provisions of subs (2a), an order for the independent children\u2019s lawyer\u2019s costs to be paid by the father or the mother or both the father and the mother should be considered just[1] quantum of costs payable unless legal aid nsw waives a party\u2019s liability to pay a contribution towards the costs of the independent children\u2019s lawyer, [the icl] must apply to the court for cost orders. if [the icl] are of the view that an application for costs should not be made in the circumstances of the matter [the icl] should contact legal aid grants and seek approval not to proceed with an application for costs. ... seek an initial contribution towards their costs from the parties to proceedings (currently $1,650 each where there are two parties). when the initial contribution is sought, the parties are provided with the icl\u2019s costs estimate and are put on notice that the icl intends to seek a costs order at the conclusion of proceedings. submissions icl maternal

proceedings. 25 the parties jointly tendered a range of documents which were marked as exhibits: exhibit no: 26 in terms of the process that was adopted, the parties were legally represented, and cross-examination did not occur. 27 all parties provided written and oral submissions. each of those submissions has been properly considered in reaching the determination, but i am not required to specifically address or respond to them individually.[1] interim hearing process 28 as the full court has observed, the interim hearing process is a truncated one in which the court should not make findings based on contested facts, but rather look to agreed facts and issues not in dispute, while still following the legislative pathway.[2] 29 pursuant to section 69zl(1) of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d) these reasons for judgment have been delivered in a short form. parenting 30 i will first turn to the parenting issues and it is necessary to provide some overview of the agreed and contested facts. 31 the mother asserts she was the primary carer for the children during the relationship. the father contends that for some periods he was. 32 the father worked as a fifo worker in international locations during the relationship and was often absent for extended periods of time. 33 after separation, the father was retrenched and remained in australia between 2020 and 2021, and the parties have been following the parenting plan referred to earlier, which was entered into on 2 may 2020. 34 just of some note in relation to the parenting plan are the matters deposed in paragraph 28 to 32 of the father\u2019s affidavit. he says that the parenting arrangements were implemented in may 2020 and only reluctantly accepted by him. he says his access to the children was threatened unless the plan was signed. that allegation is contained in paragraph 29 of his affidavit. 35 he also argues that over the last 18 months there have been numerous discussions, mediations and negotiations focused on a variation of that parenting plan. he says that, notwithstanding the two mediations held by families m, it did not result in any material increase in time with his children. it is a source of great contention for him and i do not think that is an issue in dispute. the children 36 x is attending primary school n in suburb e and she is in year 1. 37 y is attending o day care at suburb p. 38 the mother has filed a substantial affidavit where she sets out some important and pertinent information regarding the children and their needs. 39 specifically, in relation to y, she says that he was born with a birth defect. he underwent reconstructive surgery in 2019, when he was only 13 months old, at hospital q at suburb r. 40 she says he has had multiple severe food allergies and is anaphylactic to dairy in all forms, egg, sesame in all forms, and has severe allergies to asparagus and barramundi. he has been under the care of a paediatric immunologist for this condition. as a result, y\u2019s diet is challenging, given the restrictive food groups that he eats. 41 she says that in 2020 he was incorrectly administered dairy milk at day care, which resulted in his educators administering his epipen. he was rushed by ambulance to the hospital where he suffered a severe secondary reaction approximately 90 minutes later. he has now, fortunately, recovered. 42 the mother deposes of difficulties she has working with the father on issues arising from y\u2019s medical needs. she says at [45] of her affidavit: i find it difficult to co-manage y\u2019s medical and dietary requirements with the husband, who minimises and ridicules my management of y\u2019s special needs. i also hold concerns that the husband is not capable of implementing medical advice following y\u2019s food challenges. 43 at [48], she deposes that in 2021 y became unwell and was vomiting all night. she alleges that he was later delivered to the father to spend time with him, and she contacted the father some time during that evening to find out what food he tolerated. the husband advised her of some food and ended with words, \u201cbasically, he\u2019s not sick.\u201d this caused her to be somewhat concerned about his appropriate response to allergies, and, indeed, on in 2021 y was again admitted to the er at the hospital s, following bouts of vomiting. 44 the mother also alleges that y can be quite unsettled and clingy at changeovers. he often cries, and the parties have exchanged an amount of messages in relation to the changeovers and the care of y. 45 in relation to x, the mother says that she is progressing well at school and is bright, sensitive, mature and intuitive. she also says she is somewhat impressionable. at the age of three, x developed chronic constipation and has been under the care of a paediatric gastroenterologist from the age of 15 months to 4.5 years. however, the mother says her condition was later described as being behavioural in nature. 46 she says that the condition did resolve itself until x commenced having overnight time with the father in 2020 and became constipated. as a result of that, some medicines are administered. the mother says that she took x to consult with dr u in 2020, after noticing changes in her behaviour, including the constipation, as well as nightwalking and her having difficulty sleeping. 47 the mother alleges that x can be emotional in the lead-up to time with her father and often is returned to her care saying that she is hungry or complaining about the food that she eats. she also says that upon return from the father\u2019s care, x\u2019s behaviour is often out of character, defiant, and she generally finds some difficulty settling her and meeting her emotional needs. 48 the father, it should be said, disagrees with the mother\u2019s observations about x and y. he says that he has observed no emotional issues or anxiety by x when staying with him overnight, and that she enjoys spending time with him. 49 he says he also thinks y is ready to be introduced to overnight time because he will be turning three in 2021. he says that he and y have a close bond, and he is aware and is able to provide for his special dietary requirements. indeed, he recently visited dr t, his specialist, to speak with him about those requirements. 50 he also says he has been caring for y on his own without issues for more than 14 months. the father enjoys spending time with the children, and at paragraph 47 he sets out some of the activities that they have enjoyed over the past 12 months. issues in dispute 51 the issues in dispute and that require judicial determination appear to be as follows: shared parental responsibility, (b) what time the children should spend with their father when he is employed on a fifo basis, (c) what time the children should spend with their father when he is not employed on a fifo basis, (d) whether overnight time between the father and y is appropriate, and (e) communication orders. parental responsibility 52 as the court is being asked to make orders as to parenting, the first question to be determined is whether the presumption in section 61da(1) of the act applies \u2013 that is, is it in the best interests of the children that the parents have equal shared parental responsibility, and whether that presumption is rebutted. 53 it can be rebutted if there are reasonable grounds to believe a parent has engaged in abuse of a child or family violence, or the proceedings are interim and the court considers that it would not be appropriate for the presumption to be applied. 54 if the presumption is found to apply, it may further be rebutted by evidence that equal shared parental responsibility is not in the best interests of the children. 55 the family consultant observed that the communication between the parents is challenging. at the time of the report, she observed that the parents agreed to share parental responsibility, and did not therefore comment on the issue further. 56 the mother now seeks an order for sole parental responsibility. 57 in high-conflict situations, equal shared parental responsibility, which requires parents to be able to engage in joint decision-making and compromise in a way which is in the children\u2019s best interests, is often not recommended. 58 i have taken notice of the poor communication displayed by both parents in the communications they have annexed and tendered, and it bears their poor communication skills out. it is perhaps further highlighted by the fact that the father asked me to appoint a parenting coordinator to resolve any impasse that may arise. 59 the mother relies on a notice of risk filed on 13 november 2020. at paragraphs 12 to 24 of her affidavit, she sets out incidents that, she says, demonstrate coercive and controlling behaviour by the father. her allegations extend to the control he had over the parties\u2019 finances. the father denies this description and categorisation of his conduct. the father makes some allegations against the mother as well. ultimately, each told the family consultant that they have not caused harm to each other or the children. 60 at this stage, however, and pending the opportunity to fully test the evidence and make findings of fact, i am not satisfied that the allegations made allow the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility to be rebutted. 61 flowing from that, i am still required to consider certain things, including whether the children should spend equal time or substantial and significant time with each parent. this essentially is a critical issue. 62 ultimately, i must consider what orders are in the children\u2019s best interests, and whether those arrangements are reasonably practicable. the future parenting arrangements for the children the father\u2019s submissions 63 in terms of the future parenting arrangements, the father says in relation to x that when he is working as a fifo worker, he seeks the commencement of a shared care arrangement for x. he proposes she comes into his care for the first seven days that he is out of quarantine, with her care alternating between the parties each seven-night period until he leaves sydney on his next work assignment. in addition, if he does not spend 14 nights each month with x, then he seeks make up time. 64 when not contracted in fifo employment, he proposes x spend five nights a fortnight with him and half of the school holidays in a seven-night block. 65 in terms of y, the father proposes that y spend a total of 14 days and four nights per month with him when contracted to fifo employment. 66 when he is not contracted in fifo employment, two nights per fortnight and daytime care on wednesday and saturday. the mother\u2019s submissions 67 the mother proposes that when the father is in sydney, and upon completing quarantine requirements, he spend time with x each alternate weekend from after school friday until 4pm sunday. she proposes that y join x on the same weekend, but not stay overnight. 68 in addition, she proposes that the children spend time with their father each wednesday from after school until 7pm. the independent evidence 69 the family consultant was not aware of the father\u2019s plans to resume fifo work. she made two relevant observations at [30] and [33] of the memorandum: 30. in relation to mr rademaker\u2019s proposal, his proposal allows for his relationship with the children to develop further. however, x may emotionally struggle with an equal time arrangement and it may be disruptive to her weekly routine. 33. the parents agree that y could start spending some overnight time with mr rademaker when y is three years of age. the law 70 the principles governing the determination of competing parenting applications is set out in part vii of the act. 71 when making a parenting order, the court must consider what is in the best interests of the children pursuant to section 60ca. 72 the children\u2019s best interests are determined by a consideration of the objects and principles of section 60b, and the primary and additional considerations in section 60cc. 73 section 60cc(2a) of the act provides that, in applying these considerations, the court must place greater weight on the need to protect the children from harm than on the benefit to the children of having a meaningful relationship with their parents. 74 section 60cc(3) sets out some additional considerations when deciding what orders are in children\u2019s best interests. i have referred to those that are relevant. 75 i should note that the act specifically does encourage parents to enter into parenting plans. parenting plans are intended to provide a simple and informal process for formalising agreements about parenting. 76 the mother argues there is a parenting agreement between the parties, and, in the current circumstances, its terms should not be departed from. the parties entered into the parenting agreement after lengthy negotiations which involved a number of professionals. i do, however, note the father\u2019s assertion that it never represented what he was seeking. the fact that the parties are before the court would reflect this. 77 nevertheless, the court is to have regard to the terms of the most recent parenting plan entered into between the parents, if doing so would be in the children\u2019s best interests. 78 ultimately, though, the court will make orders that it considers best promote the welfare of the children, even if such orders lead to what might be regarded as an injustice between the parties or a departure from the current parenting agreement. conclusion 79 the court must balance the benefit of the children having a meaningful relationship with the father with the primary consideration of protecting the children from harm, and that includes being subjected or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. 80 both parties accepted that they have no concerns about the physical safety of the children in each other\u2019s care. 81 equally, they concede that the children have a positive relationship with each other and that they have a close and loving relationship with the children. 82 the father has resumed work as a fifo worker. while he proposes enjoying an equal or at least substantial and significant time arrangement with x when he is not away, this, in my view, is neither reasonably practicable, nor in her best interests. 83 there is enough evidence before the court to indicate that x has struggled going between households. while the parties have been working with her and other professionals to support her through an increase in time, the father was able to provide no evidence that would satisfy me that the arrangement he proposed was in x\u2019s best interests. nor are they consistent with the views she is expressing to those around her. 84 whilst i accept the father is disappointed that he is not spending more time with the children and is frustrated by what he perceives are unnecessary roadblocks in his way, his decision to resume fifo work does not allow him to build up a consistent arrangement with the children. 85 on this decision, his counsel argued, he was not putting work first, but, as he had been unemployed for a significant period of time, he was taking a responsible decision so that he could earn an income to maintain the children. 86 i observe that the mother says she has received no child support since the father departed australia. she alleges she has a child support debt of $16,088, with proceedings before the aat regarding the past child support assessment. it would seem his ongoing financial support for the children is a contentious matter that may require judicial determination on a final basis. 87 while the father is highly critical of the mother, her conduct towards him and his efforts to obtain more time with the children, he gives no evidence about his new role and how this impacts on his care of the children. 88 the mother raised some genuine concerns about x and y, and the need to transition to new arrangements with care. there was no acknowledgement of these issues by the father. he made no proposal for lead-in time. indeed, the proposal was largely premised on it being in the children\u2019s best interests solely on the basis that it allows him to spend significant time with them when he is in sydney. he could point me to no evidence before the court that supported his assertion that it would be in the children\u2019s best interests. 89 the court was left to piece together what the fifo arrangements proposed by the father would look like in reality. this is a difficult task because there was no roster or timetable. on his counsel\u2019s suggestion, he was away for six weeks then back in sydney, but in quarantine for two weeks, then possibly available to spend the next four weeks with the children. there was no evidence about the how the children would adjust, how the parties would communicate about their activities and commitments, nor consideration for how this might impact on their routines. 90 in circumstances where the father is unable to address those matters, i cannot make a finding that the father\u2019s parenting proposal is in the children\u2019s best interests. on the other hand, the current arrangements have worked well and the children are familiar with them. 91 evaluating the above-discussed considerations, i have concluded that it would be in the best interests of the children to make the following orders. 92 the current arrangements for the children will continue whilst the father is in sydney. when he is not able to spend time with them physically, an order will be made to allow him to speak with them regularly on electronic mediums. 93 the parties advised the family consultant that they agreed that y can commence overnight time with the father when he is three years old. the mother changed her position on this when she filed her amended response. while i appreciate her stated concern about the father\u2019s capacity, she is familiar with his living arrangements when he is sydney. y will be supported by the presence of his sister, and, given the high conflict between the parties, overnight time will have the advantage of reducing the number of changeovers. this will mean that y is exposed to less conflict between the parties, and can settle into one arrangement each fortnight once he is three. i will make an order to reflect this so that from november he will stay overnight with the father at the same time as his sister. 94 there has been high conflict between the parties about changeovers. it seems that an issue has arisen because the father\u2019s residence is difficult to access and it requires the mother to park illegally or park down the street and walk around 15 minutes with the children. this is impractical, and is leading to further conflict between the parties. it cannot be a positive way for the children to start or finish their time with their father. 95 for the interim period, the father will only be spending time with the children during periods when he is at home and not working. the mother will have long periods of sole parenting during his absence. in the circumstances, and on an interim basis, i will make an order requiring the father to take responsibility for the changeovers. 96 the father seeks orders appointing a parenting coordinator. he has gone to some trouble to make inquiries of an appropriate service and make a recommendation of a suitably qualified person to fill the role. the mother opposes the order. the father provided no details of the qualifications of the person. his counsel was unable to direct me to where the source of the court\u2019s power lied. in those circumstances, and without information of the qualifications of the person proposed, i decline to make such an order. 97 at the conclusion of submissions, counsel for the mother indicated that her client consented to me making some orders sought by the father. these related mainly to communication and the conduct of the parties. i have accordingly incorporated the husband\u2019s proposed orders 15, 16, 18, 19, 20, 21, 24, 27, and order 17 with a small change as proposed by counsel for the mother. there was also general agreement about special days, and these have been incorporated into the orders with minor alteration so the finishing time accords with the current arrangements. property 98 i will now turn to the property matters. 99 the mother seeks an order that within 48 hours of the date of these orders the husband do all acts and things, and sign all documents necessary to transfer to her his unencumbered interest in vehicle 1, being registration[omitted]. 100 the parties each also seek an order to be made about a tax liability to the australian tax office. it has arisen from a company which the husband is the sole director of, company b, and from the husband\u2019s personal tax liability. 101 the tax liability of $285,187 is due and payable to the ato on 30 september 2021. it is comprised of: a personal tax liability of $262,030.75 and (b) company b, $26,322.17. 102 the husband relies on an affidavit of his accountant ms j sworn on 7 july 2021, which sets out how and why the tax liability arose. 103 the tax liability has arisen largely because the husband instructed his accountant that the full director\u2019s loan of $746,250 should be repaid and accounted for in the 2020 financial year. 104 the husband argued that the tax liability needs to be addressed otherwise, significant penalties will accrue. 105 the accountant argues that there were two benefits from the accounting method adopted: one is that it allowed the loan to be realised for the purposes of the financial settlement between the parties, and, secondly, the husband was not working throughout the financial year, so was on a marginal tax rate. 106 it should be noted at this point that there has been significant disclosure and communication on this issue, and great contention between the parties. the wife disputes the validity of the loan agreements. she alleges significant discrepancies in the tax returns and company accounts. 107 the parties sold the former matrimonial home in suburb e in 2021, and an amount of $2,221,776.21 is held in a controlled monies account in trust. the husband seeks that the tax liability be paid from this fund. evidence on the issue will need to be tested at final hearing and i can make no findings of fact. 108 the husband seeks the following orders: property 2020 tax debts 32. that the parties do all acts and things to instruct newnham\u2019s solicitors to pay directly to the australian taxation office from the parties controlled monies account the following income tax debts for the year ended 30 june 2020 on or before 30 september 2021: 32.1 an amount of $262,030.70 in full satisfaction of mr rademaker\u2019s personal tax assessment liability for the year ended 30 june 2020, and 32.2 an amount of $23,030.70 in full satisfaction of mr rademaker\u2019s company b, income tax liability for the year ended 30 june 2020. 33. unless otherwise agreed by the parties, for the purposes of determining the \u2018amount and classification\u2019 of the taxation debts provided in order 32 above, the parties will do all acts and things to jointly instruct an independent forensic accountant to prepare a report on the applicant\u2019s personal income and the financial accounts of his company and movement of funds between company and personal bank accounts giving rise to the 2020 tax debts as assessed. 33.1 for the purpose of order 33, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the parties, the wife will nominate 3 forensic accounting firms within 14 days of this order, and provide cv\u2019s and costs associated to the husband\u2019s solicitor and the husband will select one and that firm will be jointly instructed by the parties. 33.2 the cost of the forensic report will be equally shared between the parties. 34. that the respondent pay the applicant\u2019s costs of and incidental to this application in a case. notation it is noted that the wife does not accept the amount of the applicant\u2019s tax liabilities referred to in order 32 above or the classification of these liabilities, and should the court not be able to determine same at interim hearing these matters will be determined by the court at final hearing with the assistance of the joint forensic accounting report provided in order 33. (as per original) 109 the husband argues that the tax returns and affidavit of the accountant support the legitimacy of the tax liability, that the debt has been accrued during the relationship and it needs to be considered in a joint balance of the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities. 110 he acknowledges that the characterisation of the tax debt is an issue, and one that needs to be determined at final hearing. he proposes i make an order for a forensic accountant to provide a report for this purpose. meanwhile, there is in excess of $2 million in controlled monies to satisfy the debt without prejudicing the wife. 111 the wife sets out in her case outline document the orders that she seeks. 112 she argues she has been told different figures for the tax liability. she is prepared to consent to the sum of $133,000 being released, but only if it is treated as an interim property distribution. 113 the mother is most concerned that it will result in an overpayment which the husband will seek to benefit from. 114 she argues that he should look to other resources to repay the amount. for example, she says the husband has retained for his sole benefit and use the proceeds of sale of motor vehicle 2 in the sum of $42,500. 115 the husband asserts that he used $50,000 to loan a company in country v, company w, via the company director mr bb, the sum of $50,000 on 25 january 2021. the husband has advised the wife he has received $25,775 in part repayment of the loan. he also has cryptocurrency he has invested in. 116 the wife is concerned that the payment of this sum amounts to 10 per cent of the property pool, and says every bit that comes out of the property pool will impact on her. 117 this matter concerns an application for an interim property distribution, and it falls under sections 79 and 80 of the act. 118 the full court of the family court of australia in the case of strahan & strahan (interim property orders) [2011] famcafc 126, (2011) flc 93-466 at [115] set out the principles to be followed by a court in addressing applications for interim property orders. the full court held that there are two steps in considering an application for an order for partial property distribution prior to final hearing, the first step being a procedural step, the second step a substantive step. 119 with respect to the first step, the full court in strahan commented at [132] that \u201cthe \u2018overarching consideration\u2019 is the interests of justice. it is not necessary to establish compelling circumstances. all that is required is that in the circumstances it is appropriate to exercise the power.\u201d 120 it is also important to recognise that, while the usual section 79 considerations apply to the substantive step of the process, a detailed analysis of those considerations is not required at an interim hearing. 121 at an interim hearing, the court is not be in a position to make findings and evaluate evidence. for this reason, the court should take a conservative approach when determining whether there are likely to be sufficient resources available at final hearing to accommodate any adjustment issues.[3] 122 in medlow & medlow (2016) flc 93-692 at 81,088 the full court confirmed that where a party seeks interim property orders, the onus is on the applicant to establish that there were sufficient assets available for the interim distribution, and that the effect of any interim order was capable of being reversed as part of the final hearing, or at least would not defeat the respondent\u2019s property claim. 123 i am not required to analyse, nor be satisfied, that the released funds are being used for an appropriate or legitimate purpose. 124 that said, i am still required to be satisfied that it is just an equitable to make an order in the circumstances before the court.[4] the tax liability 125 the husband has established that a legitimate tax liability exists. he has also established that it is due and payable on 30 september 2021. 126 the notional distributions to the husband have reduced the tax liability of the parties, pending trial. however, it is a matter for the trial judge to determine whether the husband has derived any direct benefit from the distributions, or whether it should be treated as a joint liability and taken into account in determining the parties\u2019 assets and liabilities. 127 given the legitimacy of the debt and the date it falls due to the commonwealth of australia, in my view, it is a compelling circumstance that justifies the court making an interim property order. 128 the wife also argued that $100,000 already released was the subject of the preliminary property order, but has not been properly accounted for, or, alternatively, not properly utilised by the husband. however, as i have outlined, the position at law is that the husband may choose to spend the amount however he wishes. it does not mean that i have to disregard it, but, for the purposes of this application, i can only have regard to the assets and liabilities that the parties have deposed of, as supported by the evidence tendered. 129 the husband does have $36,985 standing to his credit in a bank account. in addition, he deposes $73,480 worth of cryptocurrency assets. the existence of these funds might be one reason why the wife is resisting the payment of the whole of the amount. however, no evidence was led of the husband\u2019s ability to liquidify these assets, or the appropriateness of him being required to do so. the proceeds of sale seem to be the most obvious source of funds. 130 is it just and equitable that i make such an order? some aspects of the wife\u2019s case seem to be that there has been inadequate financial disclosure by the husband, and his failure to properly maintain the children by way of child support. there was a concern expressed by the wife, although these words were not used, that a distribution of this nature might act to defeat her possible entitlements. 131 i cannot see how this is likely. from the proceeds of sale, $2,222,000 remain. the husband seeks a payment of $285,187 to the ato, leaving an amount of $1,937,345. 132 the husband deposes additional property in excess of $1,000,100 although this might consist of $100,000 already distributed to the husband at its best, there does remain a pool of assets in excess of $3 million on the financial statement. 133 after paying out the tax liability, there still remains an amount in trust which is the equivalent of 87 per cent of that amount. it would seem just and equitable that i order for the tax liability to be paid from this source. 134 given the live issues about the validity of the husband\u2019s transactions, i will not classify it at this stage, and whether it be treated as a joint liability or otherwise will remain an issue for the trial. 135 the husband proposed that the parties engage a forensic accountant to prepare a report on the calculation of the tax liability and the movement of funds between the husband and the company. i will not make orders on this issue at this stage. the transfer of the motor vehicle 136 the motor vehicle 1 has been in the wife\u2019s possession for some time, and the husband has required her to register, insure and maintain the vehicle from her own funds. she indicates she would like to sell it and purchase a car that has lower maintenance costs. 137 the father agrees that the car should be transferred but asks me to treat the transfer as a partial property settlement and attach a value to the motor vehicle. 138 i am not satisfied that there is sufficient independent evidence upon which to attach a value to the car. the property in the wife\u2019s possession at the final hearing will be taken into account and values determined upon hearing evidence. 139 i will, however, make an order for the vehicle to be transferred to her. dated: 18 october 2021 [1] baghti & baghti [2015]

(\u201cthe child\u201d). the parties are the parents of the child who has lived in the primary care of the mother, ms hocking (\u201cthe mother\u201d) since his birth. the father mr kalmus (\u201cthe father\u201d) has spent time with the child somewhat sporadically since his birth due to various reasons that will be apparent from the reasons that follow. 2 the application by the father seeks parenting orders to ensure that he has a meaningful role in the child\u2019s life and spends regular time with the child. the main issue in contention is whether the father should have unsupervised time with the child and if so, how frequently and for how long. the mother contends that the father should spend time with the child, but supervised indefinitely. the opposing cases and evidence before the court the father\u2019s case 3 the affidavits of the father of 6 july 2021 and 8 september 2021 were read in evidence unopposed. he was cross-examined at length and in detail as to his history of criminal offending and the assertions made about family violence in the mother\u2019s affidavit material. 4 the father admitted the convictions, but did not accept the details stated by the prosecution relating to various criminal offences in all instances. 5 under cross-examination, the father also admitted many abusive, threatening and demeaning statements to and about the mother, her husband and family. he expressed regret for what he had said. 6 the father made many concessions under cross-examination contrary to his interest. he also made statements suggesting that he had gained insight into past shortcomings. he commented at times that he had been \u201cyoung and silly\u201d and \u201cthat it had been a bad period in his life\u201d. 7 he also expressed remorse and regret for how he had spoken to and about the mother, her family and her new partner. 8 the father was asked about an incident referred to in the g report of 5 february 2021. it was put to the father that he had failed to comply with instructions of the supervisor when spending time with the child who was riding a bike. the father disagreed with the reporting of the incident. he said it had been a windy day and he was running alongside his son who was riding a bike and had not heard the instruction. he stated it was a simple misunderstanding. 9 the father called ms h, his current partner. her evidence was relatively brief and addressed the period since late last year when she formed a relationship of significance with the father. her affidavit affirmed 30 june 2021, was read into evidence and she was cross-examined, the direction of which was to credit. 10 in summary, ms h\u2019s evidence was that she had experienced the father to be a supportive partner, capable of assisting her in a safe and appropriate manner with the care of her own children. she also stated that, if necessary, she would be prepared to assist the father when he spends time with the child and facilitating changeovers. 11 it was put to ms h that she had misled the court about the length of the relationship with the father and that she was capable of untruths, given evidence that she had not disclosed to centrelink that she was living with the father. it was also suggested that she was not a responsible person based on a photo taken earlier this year of her sitting on a roof drinking alcohol.[1] 12 ms h admitted it was not safe to drink alcohol while on the roof and stated her children were not present at the time. she also frankly conceded that she had not permanently moved in to live at the father\u2019s residence until june/july 2021. ms h was straightforward in her evidence and she presented as truthful. i do not believe that she set out to mislead the court. the mother\u2019s case 13 there was detailed evidence before the court regarding the mother\u2019s concerns about the father's capacity to care for the child. in summary, the evidence was as follows: (a) the father will put the child at risk of physical harm by driving when influenced by alcohol or not licensed to drive, (b) the father does not ensure the child is toileted appropriately and is a poor role model, urinating in public, (c) the father is physically violent and associates with people who have assaulted him and he fears will again assault him, putting the child at risk of harm, (d) the father\u2019s residence is not safe, and (e) the father makes inappropriate statements and remarks to the child, which will confuse the child and inappropriately influence him against the mother. for example, stating that the mother stops the father from spending more time with the child, this being damaging to the child\u2019s relationship with his mother. the father will put the child at risk of physical harm by driving when influenced by alcohol or not licensed to drive, (b) the father does not ensure the child is toileted appropriately and is a poor role model, urinating in public, (c) the father is physically violent and associates with people who have assaulted him and he fears will again assault him, putting the child at risk of harm, (d) the father\u2019s residence is not safe, and (e) the father makes inappropriate statements and remarks to the child, which will confuse the child and inappropriately influence him against the mother. for example, stating that the mother stops the father from spending more time with the child, this being damaging to the child\u2019s relationship with his mother. 14 there was common and uncontroversial evidence that the father had been having regular supervised time through the g children\u2019s homes for about 12 months. the reports of the supervised time are before the court.[2] the mother agreed under cross-examination that they were largely positive reports, indicating the father and child had a meaningful and loving relationship, and mostly appropriate conduct and communication by the father. however, the mother emphasised in her evidence a number of times that the child had been settled and thriving, because of the supervised time, implying it would be otherwise if time was unsupervised. 15 under cross-examination the mother was not willing to acknowledge the possibility that the father's past criminal history and statements and behaviours would not continue in the future. she categorically rejected the proposition that the father may be able to maintain his positive approach and improved attitude to responsible parenting in an unsupervised setting. 16 i raised with the mother the possibility that rewarding good behaviour on the father\u2019s part may further promote positive behaviours and avoid or minimise future denigration, abuse and threats. the mother had an intractable view and did not acknowledge the possibility. 17 in giving her evidence, the mother commonly responded to questions from her own personal perspective and was unable to offer under cross-examination any suggestion about how she may improve relations between her and the father. 18 the mother\u2019s husband mr j gave evidence. he also presented in a straightforward and honest manner. he was prepared to take the father\u2019s apology and regret for past hurtful statements at face value and move forward. this was in contrast to the mother\u2019s fixed attitude. 19 three other affidavits were read into evidence unopposed, being the: affidavit of ms k sworn 21 june 2021. this witness is the maternal grandmother, affidavit of ms l (the mother\u2019s adult daughter) sworn 22 june 2021, and affidavit of ms m sworn 12 july 2021. ms m was a former partner of the father, who was the subject of family violence referred to in the father\u2019s criminal history. 20 the evidence referred to in [19] is relatively brief and corroboratory of the harmful effects of the father\u2019s past statements and behaviours on the mother and her family generally. in terms of specific evidence rather than generalisations, they address particular incidents around separation in 2015 when it is said the father broke through the door of the mother\u2019s home and a changeover in the park on or about 15 may 2020. 21 regarding the incident in 2015, the evidence of the mother was that when the father arrived at her property, he was inebriated and \u201ccould barely walk\u201d, and that he broke into the house through a back door held shut with a knife. her evidence was that she was fearful after this incident, and that her eldest child is still scared. 22 in cross-examination, the father denied that the mother and children were scared at the time of the incident in 2015. he said there was a practice of forcing the door open as it was held shut with a knife wedged in to the wall panelling. his evidence was that the mother had requested that he go to her house. when he arrived she did not answer when he knocked or when he telephoned her, and so he let himself in. 23 as to the incident in the park in may 2020, at changeover, the father\u2019s evidence was that the mother\u2019s children in the car had ignored his enquiry about the whereabouts of the mother and child. he seemed to concede that he was probably annoyed and abusive, but denied that the mother was frightened. he offered that his behaviour was poor and acceptable, indicative that he had reflected and gained insight. closing contentions for the mother 24 in closing submissions, counsel for the mother, submitted that the father's record of prior convictions demonstrates a long history of defiance of the law and a pattern of violence and denigration of women. i offered the observation that the record of prior convictions suggested that alcohol abuse was the common contributing or triggering factor to the offending. this was not conceded. 25 counsel made very forceful submissions that the father was persistently lawless, violent and non-compliant, and that \u201cat 47 years of age, the father has no capacity to change and he is what he is\u201d. this, he submitted, establishes on the balance of probabilities that the father has no capacity to alter his manner and behaviours towards the mother and her family. further, this means that the father will continue to cause the mother and her family emotional harm and/or put the child at risk. 26 when i commented that there may be some evidence of capacity to change, counsel submitted that the father\u2019s criminal history showed that there had not been much or lasting change in the father. he contended the court has only two levers for minimising the negative impact of the father's behaviour on the mother and her family and in turn the child. those levers are: (a) how much time the father should spend with the child, and (b) whether time should be supervised. how much time the father should spend with the child, and (b) whether time should be supervised. 27 counsel submitted that the court could not to be satisfied about the father's capacity to desist from the abusive and threatening behaviours based on the father\u2019s supervised time during the last 12 months and the limited positive experiences with the child. it was submitted that despite supervised time, the father had continued to behave in a manner that was destructive of any trust and a workable co-parenting relationship by denigrating the mother, her husband and the mother's family. 28 there was also reliance on the authority of re andrew [1996] famca 43, it being contended that the father\u2019s conduct had impacted on the mother\u2019s mental health and capacity to care for the children. the evidentiary basis for this reliance is in part set out in the mother\u2019s affidavit filed 25 june 2021.[3] 29 counsel stated that although the father had made many concessions about his conduct, what was missing was honesty and candour as was exampled by the incredulous evidence from the father about the source of the cash payment of $12,000 to the mother and the reason why the person named mr n had assaulted him. 30 all of the extensive submissions for the mother were made with a view towards persuading me that only one thing had worked in terms of a positive relationship between the father and the child, that one thing being supervised time, which should continue. despite this, it was acknowledged that supervision \u201ccould not be forever\u201d. 31 i enquired as to the length of time there should be supervision. no particular period was identified, instead it was stated that as the child got older he would be able to self-protect. for the father 32 counsel for the father emphasised that the mother's closing submissions heavily focused on the father\u2019s past crimes and his verbal abuse/threats and how they impacted the mother. further, that her case did not address the fundamental issue for the court, namely the best interests of the child. he submitted that there was a more positive slant to be taken from the evidence, being that the parties did have capacity to develop trust between themselves and that being the case, that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility had not been rebutted. 33 the father\u2019s counsel submitted that although the considerations in section 60cc(3) of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u201cthe act\u201d) were relevant, ultimately the case fell to be determined on the provisions of section 60cc(2)(a) and 2(b). there was brief oral elucidation given to the submissions contained in paragraphs 1 to 16 of the father\u2019s case outline dated 8 october 2021, which i do not repeat. 34 it was contended that indefinite supervised time between the father and child would bring an end to or curtail the meaningful relationship existing between father and child. this meaningful relationship, was said to be well documented in the contents of the two g reports in evidence, much of which was also admitted by the mother in cross-examination. 35 i was referred to moose & moose [2008] famcafc 108, at paragraph 119, which i set out below: 119. the undesirability of, and the practical difficulties associated with long term supervision in a children\u2019s contact centre are referred to in the guideline for family law courts and children\u2019s contact services january 2007, part c 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 (published by the attorney-general\u2019s department, the family court of australia and the federal magistrates court of australia). in fitzpatrick & fitzpatrick [2005] famca 394, (2005) flc 93-227, may j, having found that the evidence in the case \u201cobjectively viewed reveals the potential for an unacceptable risk to the children if contact with the father is not supervised...\u201d, then referred to the difficulty associated with long term supervised contact and said \u201cthe necessity for contact to be supervised apparently indefinitely leads to the need to finely balance what is in the children\u2019s best interests\u201d. her honour then explained \u201c[w]hilst supervised contact in this case will protect the children from any potential physical harm, the effect on their emotional well-being cannot be ignored\u201d. (see also w & w [abuse allegations: unacceptable risk] [2005] famca 892, (2005) flc 93-235, (2005) 34 fam lr 129 at paragraph 114). 36 in concluding that the appeal ought be allowed, the full court of the family court said at [120]: 120. his honour\u2019s reasons omit consideration of the family consultant\u2019s oral evidence, the recommendations of the icl, or discussion of the practical long term effects on the children of an indefinite order for supervised contact in a children\u2019s contact centre, nor do the orders reflect his honour\u2019s findings that the children should spend more and more time with the father as \u201cthey get older\u201d. thus, i am satisfied this complaint has merit. 37 the father\u2019s conduct was said to be low level compared to other cases that typically came before this court. however, when queried by me about this, he quite properly conceded that they did establish some distress to the mother, which impacted on the co-parenting relationship. he added that there was no consequent harm to the child, at least not which is demonstrated on the evidence before the court. 38 in addressing the re andrew submission by the mother\u2019s counsel, counsel for the father contended that the bar was a very high one and that the evidence in this case did not show the required impact on the mother's parenting capacity. instead, there were self-serving, subjective statements from the mother that did not rise to the required standard of proof. 39 counsel emphasised that it was the child's wish to spend more time with his father, that the past trajectory of the case had been unsupervised overnight time with consideration to this extending to two nights, until the mother unilaterally ceased the father's time with the child in october 2020. he referred to the mother\u2019s evidence during cross-examination, when she agreed she stopped facilitating time when informed that the father was driving with the child while he was unlicensed. 40 the inference in the submission referred to at [39] was that cessation of time was unreasonable. i suggested that it was legitimate to have some concern, as there was a risk of physical harm should there be an accident, and not having maib cover. this was conceded. 41 i made enquiry as to what preventative and protective measures may be appropriate should the court be satisfied that the father spend unsupervised time with the child. the following submissions were made as being appropriate: (a) that the father not drink 12 hours prior to his time with the child or while the child is in his care, (b) that the father be breathalysed prior to the commencement of any time with the child. (c) that changeover be at a police station where the parties, particularly the father, can be monitored regarding their conduct, (d) that the father undergo random cdt testing for alcohol and drug use, and (e) that the father's new partner may facilitate changeover rather than the father interacting with the mother to alleviate the mother\u2019s fears/stress. that the father not drink 12 hours prior to his time with the child or while the child is in his care, (b) that the father be breathalysed prior to the commencement of any time with the child. (c) that changeover be at a police station where the parties, particularly the father, can be monitored regarding their conduct, (d) that the father undergo random cdt testing for alcohol and drug use, and (e) that the father's new partner may facilitate changeover rather than the father interacting with the mother to alleviate the mother\u2019s fears/stress. 42 discussion occurred about a prior suggestion that changeover occur at a police. the mother stated that town b or town c police stations, which had been considered, were not permanently open with personnel present, but that the area was under cctv surveillance, so afforded some protection. 43 in submissions in reply, counsel for the mother re-engaged with my suggestion that alcohol abuse appeared to be a common denominator in the father's criminal offending. he submitted that the case was not all about alcohol and that it was about to the father's incapacity to comply with reasonable and necessary protections. mr foster emphasised the passages from the g report of 5 february 2021.[4] he referred to the reported attitude of the father and statements towards the supervisors in the family connections program report: on 5 february 2021 during a visit [the father] refused to take guidance or prompts from the worker to assist her in the ending the visit on time. [the father] ignored repeated prompts from both the worker and his partner ms h (surname unknown). it is concerning that [the father] does not seems to be able to follow simple instructions as agreed in our code of conduct in terms of being safe and respectful to g staff. ... [the father] has made statements in relation to the [the mother] that are blaming, hypercritical and negative in his conversation with staff. these comments are characterized by tone, pitch and pauses, in the way he delivers his negative thoughts and opinions about [the mother] and her parenting. observations made to two g staff have suggested that they believe [the father] would likely make negative comments to [the child], about his mother, if they were not supervised by a third party. ... ...[the father] is consistently disparaging in his commentary and opinions of [the mother\u2019s] motives and parenting style. evaluation and findings 44 the evidence contained in the father\u2019s criminal record and his concessions under cross examination establish the following: (a) the father\u2019s offending began when he was 17 years old and he was convicted of being under-aged in a bar in 1991, (b) by age 25 years, he had approximately 11 court appearances and 16 convictions. of these convictions 3 related to abuse of alcohol, 3 to violence, 1 for driving unlicensed and two for dishonesty, (c) between 25 and 30 years of age, there were no convictions, (d) between 30 and 40 years of age there are about 19 court appearances and over 35 convictions (not including re-sentences for breach of conditions of probation). approximately five of these convictions related to driving while over the prescribed alcohol limit and six relating to drive while disqualified or without a license. three related to breach of family violence orders. in addition, there were convictions for non-compliance with various statutory requirements of car use and assaults, (e) from age 40 to 45 years, there are convictions for two high reading breathalyser offences and drive while disqualified. the father was also re-sentenced in this period for breach of conditions of probation relation to prior breach of family violence convictions, (f) there is no evidence of further offending after march 2019. the father\u2019s offending began when he was 17 years old and he was convicted of being under-aged in a bar in 1991, (b) by age 25 years, he had approximately 11 court appearances and 16 convictions. of these convictions 3 related to abuse of alcohol, 3 to violence, 1 for driving unlicensed and two for dishonesty, (c) between 25 and 30 years of age, there were no convictions, (d)

while disqualified. the father was also re-sentenced in this period for breach of conditions of probation relation to prior breach of family violence convictions, (f) there is no evidence of further offending after march 2019. 45 as a result of the breathalyser-related convictions referred to at [44(e)] above, the father served imprisonment for 2 months in 2017 and 4 months in march 2019. he also received suspended sentences and home detention. 46 the last assault referred to in the criminal record relates to an incident in 2014. the re-sentences for breach of family violence in 2017 relate to breach of conditions of good behaviour connected to the earlier sentences handed down in october 2014. they do not relate to new episodes of assault or violence. 47 the last conviction relating to alcohol and driving while disqualified is in march 2019. 48 the findings above demonstrate a criminal record involving repeat high level breathalyser driving-related offences, driving while disqualified and some incidents of family violence and assaults. this may reflect deliberate flaunting of the law. 49 however, in my view there is a common theme in the record reflective of alcohol abuse and the offending is largely (although not solely) in connection with that. it is also significant in my view that there have not been convictions for assault or family violence since 2014. 50 there is no evidence of physical violence or assault of the mother during her relationship with the father or since separation. some of the admitted statements by the father about the mother and her family are capable of being characterised as repeated derogatory taunts, which is an example of behaviour that may amount to family violence, within the meaning of that term as provided in section 4ab of the act. 51 excess consumption of alcohol may explain much of the father\u2019s criminal offending and emotional dysregulation relating to assaults and violence. however, in my view it does not wholly explain the father\u2019s admitted conduct towards to the mother since 2020. 52 as suggested in the child dispute memorandum dated 24 february 2021,[5] having regard to the entirety of the father\u2019s evidence, he is likely to have less cautious attitudes to risky behaviours. further, the evidence suggests maladaptive coping mechanisms when things do not go his way. 53 as there have been no episodes of physical violence or assaults in the last six years, this suggests some capacity to improve conduct and his past record. there have been no alcohol-related crimes since march 2019 and the father has secured and maintained stable employment since his release from prison. he has also largely reliably adhered to quite restrictive requirements related to supervised time spent with the child for twelve months. 54 i do not accept that the father deliberately has ignored or flaunted instructions from the supervisors during his time with the child. the february report from g was early in the process of supervised time and it is easy to envisage how there may be a misunderstanding about the bike incident. 55 although in its infancy, the father has also formed a relationship with ms h. counsel for the mother criticised the bone fides of the relationship and suggested it was short and not likely to continue, but the undisturbed evidence is that the relationship is settled, mutually supportive and absent of family violence. 56 based on the father\u2019s evidence, it would appear that he has developed some insight into the shortcomings of his past conduct and i consider his evidence was honest and genuine. however, the relatively short time involved in improved conduct referred to at [53] and [54] together with his past history does raise some doubt about the father\u2019s capacity to engage permanently in the positive behaviours with the mother and the child. 57 the mother's case focused heavily on the father's history of offending and his record of prior convictions. it also relied on numerous admitted or corroborated statements or incidents in which the father adversely interacted with her and her family. 58 however, the mother gave evidence that she suffers from ptsd and anxiety that originates from prior to her relationship with the father and these parenting matters. it follows that she is likely to have pre-existing emotional vulnerability and despite this, she has been resilient and continued to live life to the full, raising a large family, parenting all her children and working. 59 in giving her evidence, the impression i gained was that she amplified the anxiety associated with the father\u2019s statements and conduct. this may be due to her personality or pre-existing mental health. she would not entertain the possibility that the father could improve how he communicated with her and his attitude of her. this is despite the fact that there have not been any family violence orders between the mother and the father or breach of them. there is no suggestion that there has been family violence involving the child. 60 the incident in 2015 was conveyed differently by the evidence relied upon by the parties. i accept that it may have been somewhat distressing to the mother and her children at the time, but no report was made to police. it seems probable that events since and commencement of these proceedings have led to emphasis of concern above what it objectively involved at the time. i note that the mother agreed under cross-examination that there was a practice of using force to open a door held shut with a knife at the time of this incident. 61 the parties have each described the incident at the park in 2020 differently. the mother's trial affidavit affirmed 22 june 2021, does not refer to this incident at all. her affidavit affirmed on 5 february 2021 does refer to the incident, but quite briefly and less graphically than conveyed in her oral evidence.[6] 62 regarding admitted verbal denigration, abuse and threats by the father, i conclude that this has centred upon the mother ceasing the father\u2019 time with the child and her perception of the risk the father poses to the welfare of the child. the verbal denigration, abuse and threats need to be viewed in the context of the conflict over the father\u2019s time with the child as it predominantly has occurred since the mother ceased the father\u2019s progression of time in october 2019. 63 i agree with the observation of the family consultant at [23] of the cdc memo: the parties both presented with limited flexibility in their proposals, both believing to have [the child\u2019s] best interests at heart. 64 the mother's fixed views were evident from the evidence she gave under cross-examination. her evidence was that she only knew of some of the father's criminal history when she entered into a relationship with him. later discovery of the extent of his criminal history has likely influenced her perception of interactions with the father and attitude to him spending time with the child. 65 the content of and manner of communication by the father has been inappropriate. it is not conducive to effective co-parenting. however, the evidence also demonstrates that the father is willing to improve his approach and i consider he genuinely wishes to change. whether this is only because of the spotlight of the proceedings is difficult to assess, but i am inclined to the view that the father has developed some insight as he has: an improved record since 2014, noting the findings at [46] and [47], expressed regret for his statements to about and to the mother and her family and accepts the mother is a good mother, acknowledged and accepted feedback under supervision, such that the later reports from g are positive ones, positively supported ms h in caring for her children, and indicated he will undertake any courses or education required to address his behaviours. 66 based on the views of the family consultant and the g reports, together with my assessment of the father\u2019s evidence, i am satisfied that he has a meaningful relationship with the child. relevant law and principles 67 in parenting proceedings, the paramountcy principle applies and the court is required to make orders that are in the best interests of the child/children.[7] express direction is provided in section 60b(1) of the act that this object is to be achieved by ensuring that the child has the benefit of both of their parents having meaningful involvement in their life, to the maximum extent consistent with the child\u2019s best interest. the court is to inform itself of the child\u2019s best interests by the considerations in section 60cc(2) and (3) of the act. 68 section 60cc(2) requires the court to make orders that are conducive to a child having a meaningful relationship with both parents, but not if this would detract from necessary protection of the child from physical or psychological harm or exposure to abuse, neglect or family violence. the assessment required also involves consideration of the many considerations in section 60cc(3) as relevant to the circumstances of any given case, but there is no ranking of importance or order of consideration of the relevant considerations.[9] 69 the evaluation of risk of harm required by subparagraphs (a) and (b) of section 60cc(2) is a challenging one to be undertaken on the basis of findings of fact about the nature and degree of risk of harm to the child and the likelihood of it eventuating.[10] 70 in addition to the foregoing, the court is also to apply a rebuttable presumption that it is in a child\u2019s best interests for the parents to have equal shared parental responsibility.[11] this presumption accords with the objective referred to in section 60b(1) of the act. the meaning of parental responsibility is expressly but not exhaustively provided for in the act.[12] 71 except in the case of consent orders, if the court is satisfied that the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility applies and is not rebutted it must first consider if the child spending equal time with each parent would be in their best interest and if practicable, make such an order.[13] 72 if not persuaded to make an equal spend time with order, the court must then consider whether the child spending substantial and significant time with each parent would be in the child\u2019s best interests and if so and it is reasonably practicable, an order for substantial and significant time should be made. the meaning of the phrase substantial and significant time is provided for in subsection 65daa(3). 73 in mrr & gr [2010] hca 4, the high court provided guidance in relation to how the provisions in section 65daa are to be applied and i have had regard to that authority.[14] i am also mindful of the required decision making pathway established in goode & goode [2006] famca1346. all the considerations in section 60cc are to inform what is in the best interests of a child, which is relevant to making an order for equal shared parental responsibility if the presumption in section 61da(1) does not apply by virtue of section 61da(2), or making orders about equal or significant time when the presumption has been rebutted. determination and proposed orders 74 the admissions by the father about his communications (including by text) constitute repeat derogatory taunts and establish family violence within the meaning of the act.[15] consequently, the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility does not apply, but i am not precluded from making such an order if satisfied it is otherwise in the child\u2019s best interest.[16] 75 in addressing the required factors in section 60cc(2)(a) and (b) of the act, the findings made above demonstrate the possibility of some degree risk of harm to the child. i largely accept the submissions made on behalf of the father in relation to all section 60cc(3) considerations as set out in his case outline, subject to the remarks and qualifications referred to elsewhere in these reasons. in some respects, the father\u2019s submissions overstate the demonstrated positive changes and insight and understate the limited involvement the father had with the child in the first few years of his life. there possibly has been too little time pass to be confident of enduring improved conduct and entrenchment of his meaningful relationship with the child, but the orders i intend to make will address this by imposing restraints and suspension of time should risk factors increase. 76 during the hearing, i questioned the father about his criminal record, suggesting it demonstrated lack of emotional and physical regulation. i asked him how he thought this may be addressed. he stated that he would avoid communications with the mother. this may not bode well for safe and effective co-parenting in the future. i enquired how he could moderate his interactions and if he would undertake courses and education designed to avoid conflict. the father stated that he would do whatever i asked him to do and that he was willing to undertake any course ordered. 77 the evidence referred to at [76] appeared genuine and i consider the father has capacity to interact differently and in a child-focussed way with the mother, her family and the child. 78 the father has shown a desire and reasonable success in avoiding and limiting the demonstrated past harmful effects of alcohol abuse and the risk this may pose to the child. there is no evidence of actual harm to the child from alcohol abuse or denigrating statements and i assess the likelihood of risk of harm to the child, either physical or emotional, to be low. 79 i have carefully considered the submissions made by counsel for the mother, including those set out under the heading relating to primary considerations in section 60cc(2). they emphasise the quality of the mother\u2019s relationship with the child and ignore the positive aspects of the father\u2019s relationship with the child. 80 the facts and circumstances of each of the authorities to which i was referred by counsel for the mother as justifying an order for sole parental responsibility are markedly different to those in this matter. in grant & grant (1994) flc 92-506, the court had expert evidence from a forensic psychiatrist, of the kind i suggested was necessary during the hearing to meet the standard of proof to follow re andrew ratio. in sedgeley & sedgley [1995] famca 154, there was evidence that the father\u2019s behaviour had \u201cdamaged every aspect of the wife\u2019s life\u201d, which i have found is not the case in this matter. even then the trial judge was found to have erred, because ceasing time between the child and father would not alleviate the mother\u2019s concerns about the father\u2019s behaviour towards her and ceasing time was not in the child\u2019s best interest. 81 the mother\u2019s case also relied on criticism of the father\u2019s parenting.[17] a number, but not all, of the criticisms are likely based on different standards of propriety, risk, cleanliness or manners. the evidence from the mother and her corroborative witnesses about the impacts on the child were in the nature of general assertion rather than persuasive facts. the differences in parenting style and standards will pose some challenges, but there is no objective evidence that the father\u2019s approach is likely to harm the child. 82 as suggested by the family consultant it will be beneficial for the parties to endeavour to align routines and expectations of the child to avoid further conflicts about the subjective criticisms the mother makes. this can be addressed by the parties undertaking courses relating to effective co-parenting after separation. given the father\u2019s evidence and conduct especially over the last 12 months, i accept he will participate in such courses as required by the court. 83 as to the extent that the mother was critical of the father\u2019s capacity to keep the child safe, there is no evidence that the father has subjected the child to unacceptable risks. the evidence relating to the interactions with the person named mr n does not permit me to be satisfied of the real basis for this person seeking out the father and assaulting him. the father recognised that the child may be exposed to harm during a time that this person was threating him and it is material to the issue of the child\u2019s welfare that the father acted protectively by notifying the mother and not having the child in his care. 84 there was some reference in the mother\u2019s case to the father\u2019s use and growth of marijuana, but there were only two references to this in the evidence. when cross-examined about the allegation that he gave the mother cash from sale of a crop he had grown and that the assault by mr n was related to drugs, the father denied this. i am not inclined to make any adverse findings about this topic as one would have expected the father\u2019s significant criminal record to feature offences relating to marijuana, if this was a material concern in the risk assessment required by section 60cc(2). whatever the fact is of the father\u2019s use of marijuana, there is no evidence that it is likely to impair capacity to care for the child. further, his demonstrated capacity to maintain stable employment in a responsible position, suggests no drug abuse or impairment. 85 the father has not had opportunity due to his periods of imprisonment and subsequent limitation of time with the child to exercise effective parental responsibility. the mother has effectively exercised parental responsibility alone to date. her fixed attitude of the father makes it unlikely that she will easily cooperate with him about decisions pertaining to parental responsibility. 86 it is not in the child\u2019s best interests for the parents to be in conflict about major and long term decisions such as health and education. the mother has been the primary carer, reliably and consistently exercising parental responsibility for the child. she should continue to be largely responsible for making final decisions of this nature. however, it is reasonable and appropriate that she consult with the father to endeavour to agree a position and keep him informed. 87 as the presumption of equal shared parental responsibility does not apply, the court need not first consider if the father should have equal time or alternatively significant time with the child. but what orders are made about the father spending time with the child should be determined by overriding considerations of what is in the child\u2019s best interests and practicable. 88 there is no evidence of logistical barriers that would make either equal time or significant time impracticable. however, the child\u2019s age and limited time to date between father and child (supervised time in the last 12 months), together with the fact that the mother has been the primary carer, dictates that time should slowly and progressively increase in my view. this progressive approach will ensure the child satisfactorily adjusts to the changes and the father consolidates his improved attitudes towards the mother and her family. 89 the father\u2019s time with the child should also transition to unsupervised time, as this is consistent with fully promoting the father\u2019s meaningful relationship with the child and i am not satisfied that there is unacceptable risk to the child. 90 i have arrived at this view because the child is unlikely to have a fully meaningful relationship with the father by spending limited and supervised time as the mother proposes indefinitely. without increased and unsupervised time, the child would never experience the father other than in an abstract environment for brief periods, far removed from daily parent/child relations. indefinite supervised time would likely be limited to recreational or play settings (based on the evidence before the court) and this will not permit the child to experience all beneficial facets of the child/parent relationship. 91 the court will hear the parties as to the precise terms of the final orders i propose in accordance with these reasons. as the court\u2019s proposed orders do not fully accord with those sought by either party, i will hear from the parties\u2019 counsel before making final orders. associate: dated: 11

if not whether i had no jurisdiction to make orders pursuant to part viii of the act to make orders for adjustment of property interests of parties to a marriage, and (2) if that was the case, whether the application could be brought pursuant to part viiiab of the act, particularly considering that the application was not issued within the standard application period. if that was the case, whether the application could be brought pursuant to part viiiab of the act, particularly considering that the application was not issued within the standard application period. his honour: [mr tarabi], the fact that you and [ms odawa] lived together although not legally married to one another but you cohabited within the meaning of the family law act section 4aa and that is that you were living in a de facto relationship as defined by the act. by reason of part viiab of the family law act which includes those sections 90sm and 90sf that was sent to you on monday night. that gives not identical but almost identical jurisdiction for me to deal with the property application whether you were married or not. so for practical purposes the fact of a de facto relationship is not identical to marriage. there are some small differences but it is, in substance, the same law that applies [with] the same principles of, firstly, that i have jurisdiction and, secondly, the manner in which i determine the case. and that is the preferred approach referred to in keskin, the full court authority to which i referred you. so i dismiss your application to stay the proceedings or have the proceedings dismissed without further hearing on the basis of a lack of jurisdiction because as a result ...the whole of part viiiab i do have jurisdiction, but your understanding of that is not unusual, [mr tarabi], so thank you for reminding me to rule on that. 44 institution of proceedings ... proceedings in relation to de facto relationships subject to subsection (6), a party to a de facto relationship may apply for an order under section 90se, 90sg or 90sm, or a declaration under section 90sl, only if: (a) the application is made within the period (the standard application period) of: (i) 2 years after the end of the de facto relationship, or (ii) 12 months after a financial agreement between the parties to the de facto relationship was set aside, or found to be invalid, as the case may be, or (b) both parties to the de facto relationship consent to the application. the application is made within the period (the standard application period) of: (i) 2 years after the end of the de facto relationship, or (ii) 12 months after a financial agreement between the parties to the de facto relationship was set aside, or found to be invalid, as the case may be, or (b) both parties to the de facto relationship consent to the application. 2 years after the end of the de facto relationship, or (ii) 12 months after a financial agreement between the parties to the de facto relationship was set aside, or found to be invalid, as the case may be, or ) 12 months after a financial agreement between the parties to the de facto relationship was set aside, or found to be invalid, as the case may be, or both parties to the de facto relationship consent to the application. ) however, if proceedings are instituted by an application made with the consent of both of the parties to the de facto relationship, the court may dismiss the proceedings if it is satisfied that, because the consent was obtained by fraud, duress or unconscionable conduct, allowing the proceedings to continue would amount to a miscarriage of justice. the court may grant the party leave to apply after the end of the standard application period if the court is satisfied that: (a) hardship would be caused to the party or a child if leave were not granted, or (b) in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party\u2014the party\u2019s circumstances were, at the end of the standard application period, such that he or she would have been unable to support himself or herself without an income tested pension, allowance or benefit. hardship would be caused to the party or a child if leave were not granted, or (b) in the case of an application for an order for the maintenance of the party\u2014the party\u2019s circumstances were, at the end of the

different state, and so was difficult to contact, that ms odawa unsuccessfully tried to contact mr tarabi several times, and ms odawa made the application at the earliest date possible. (b) in regards to hardship, ms odawa had been making payments to the mortgage over five years and so there would be the loss of her prospective entitlement to the property alteration orders, and (c) in regards to prejudice to mr tarabi, ms odawa's counsel pointed to mr tarabi being able to gather banking evidence from that time and no evidence of being unable to proceed or having any hardship due to ms odawa's repayment of the mortgage. in regards to hardship, ms odawa had been making payments to the mortgage over five years and so there would be the loss of her prospective entitlement to the property alteration orders, and (c) in regards to prejudice to mr tarabi, ms odawa's counsel pointed to mr tarabi being able to gather banking evidence from that time and no evidence of being unable to proceed or having any hardship due to ms odawa's repayment of the mortgage. in regards to prejudice to mr tarabi, ms odawa's counsel pointed to mr tarabi being able to gather banking evidence from that time and no evidence of being unable to proceed or having any hardship due to ms odawa's repayment of the mortgage. generally, ms odawa\u2019s solicitors knew or should have known that they applied outside of the timeline, ms odawa\u2019s solicitor is married to ms odawa\u2019s cousin and so has an interest in the matter, ms odawa\u2019s solicitor knows that mr tarabi is kind and more likely to agree or overlook little things like missed deadlines, mr tarabi is not a lawyer and does not have appropriate legal knowledge on these issues, (b) on the hardship point, the property was rented out in 2015 for around $840 per fortnight, which is more than ms odawa is paying in mortgage repayments ($700 per fortnight) and so is losing potential income which should not be taken as hardship, that ms odawa had been effectively renting the property from him for the past five years for less than the market rate, and that ms odawa has re-partnered and is not in financial difficulty shows that she has no general hardship. on the hardship point, the property was rented out in 2015 for around $840 per fortnight, which is more than ms odawa is paying in mortgage repayments ($700 per fortnight) and so is losing potential income which should not be taken as hardship, that ms odawa had been effectively renting the property from him for the past five years for less than the market rate, and that ms odawa has re-partnered and is not in financial difficulty shows that she has no general hardship. applicable law \u2013 general in a civil proceeding, the court must find the case of a party proved if it is satisfied that the case has been proved on the balance of probabilities. (2) without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: without limiting the matters that the court may take into account in deciding whether it is so satisfied, it is to take into account: the nature of the cause of action or defence, and (b) the nature of the subject-matter of the proceeding, and (c) the gravity of the matters alleged. reliability and credit of the parties ] ...in recent years, judges have become more aware of scientific research that has cast doubt on the ability of judges (or anyone else) to tell truth from falsehood accurately on the basis of such appearances. considerations such as these have encouraged judges, both at trial and on appeal, to limit their reliance on the appearances of witnesses and to reason to their conclusions, as far as possible, on the basis of contemporary materials, objectively established facts and the apparent logic of events...

[mr tarabi] raised concerns that [ms odawa] has encouraged the children to reject him, being purposefully obstructive to him re-establishing a relationship with them. ... [ms odawa] reported a history of depression including suicidal ideation during the parties\u2019 relationship. she advised that she took anti-depressant medication for a period of two years. [ms odawa] expressed that she is currently managing her mental health well, and having positive familial supports around her. she is not currently engaged in counselling, reporting in her view she does not require professional assistance. ... in addition to the psychological harm concerns, [ms odawa] reported that she worried the children would also be at risk of physical abuse if made to spend time with [mr tarabi]. she reported that although there was limited physical abuse historically perpetrated against the children, they witnessed [mr tarabi] \u201cbeating\u201d her regularly. she added that of the four children it was only [y] who had been chastised by [mr tarabi], reporting he had assaulted her with an object when disobedient. ... [mr tarabi] was on time, and presented neatly for the interview. he reported that he is residing in sydney, in shared accommodation and not currently employed. [mr tarabi] expressed a desire to re-establish a relationship with the children, which had broken down following the parties\u2019 separation. he advised that the reason he had not maintained these relationships was due to [ms odawa], who reportedly has been obstructive over the last six years. ... [mr tarabi] explained that he was born in [country d], and orphaned as a child. he then went to live in an orphanage in [country j], before moving when he was approximately 12 years old commencing soldier training and becoming a \u201cchild soldier\u201d. following this, [mr tarabi] lived in a refugee camp, before being sponsored by a friend to enter australia. although acknowledging the hardship of this experience, he advised that it is this that has made him into the person he is today, and he would not change it for any alternate upbringing. he advised that this has made him into an empathetic and resilient adult, leading him to his previous work within the community. ... the parties provided disparate, any contradictory accounts of family violence that occurred, and whom was the primary aggressor of this during their relationship. should [mr tarabi]\u2019s account be accepted, [ms odawa] has likely used various systems including legal avenues to discourage and obstruct the children\u2019s relationship with [mr tarabi]. [ms odawa] however provided a compelling account of her experience of family violence throughout the relationship, which closely aligns to collateral information, and the children\u2019s presentations during interview. considering all of this information, it is unlikely that [ms odawa]\u2019s allegations of significant and high risk family violence perpetrated by [mr tarabi] are completely unfounded or fabricated. the types of abuse described by [ms odawa] during the interview fits a profile of potential high risk and significant harm. at current [ms odawa] reported that she has come to terms with her experiences, and with some support has been able to move past this impacting her. [ms odawa]\u2019s presentation was calm when discussing this, and in some ways she was minimising of the overall impact it has had on her, and potentially the high level of risk she described to experience over an enduring period of time. supporting [ms odawa], and assisting her to process these experiences could best support her in the long term, and would act as a protective factor, likely stabilising her further and providing the children with a consistent and reliable primary care figure. it is possible that [ms odawa] would benefit from ongoing therapeutic support. the children\u2019s presentations were indicative of a current safe and stable family home, in which they have a trusting and secure attachment with their mother. it is unknown to what extent they have been historically exposed to family violence, however if there is any veracity to the report of family violence, these experiences were likely traumatic. in order for the children to thrive, and move through their developmental stages to reach their potential, it is imperative that that this foundation of safety and stability is maintained. the children have clearly reported not wanting to re-establish any form of relationship with [mr tarabi]. they currently enjoy a safe and harmonious family unit in which they are well supported and report a strong sense of belonging. this, along with the extended period of time in which [mr tarabi] has been absent, as well as [mr tarabi] presenting without insight into the children\u2019s experiences and therefore any awareness as what behaviours need to be modified it is unlikely that re-introducing [mr tarabi] to the children will be of benefit to them. recommendations based on the available information, and in absence of evidence to the contrary, it is respectfully recommended, 79. the children live with their mother, [ms odawa]. consideration be given to parental responsibility been granted to the primary parent with whom the children reside. no spend time or communication to occur between the children and their father [mr tarabi]. should any of the children seek re-establishing this relationship in the future, this should be done with careful consideration, and ideally with therapeutic input and direction.

made by one or both of the parties, the husband and wife are no longer living in a marital relationship. it will be just and equitable to make a property settlement order in such a case because there is not and will not thereafter be the common use of property by the husband and the wife. no less importantly, the express implicit assumptions that underpinned the existing property arrangements have been brought to an end by the voluntary severance of the mutuality of the marital relationship... and the assumption that any adjustment of those interests could be effected consensually as needed or desired is also brought to an end. hence it will be just and equitable that the court make a property settlement order. what order, if any, should then be made is determined by applying s 79(4) (and/or section 90sm(3)). the preferred approach ] the case law reveals that there is a preferred approach to the determination of an application pursuant to the provisions of section 79. that approach involves four interrelated steps. firstly, the court should make findings as to the identity and value of the property, liabilities and financial resources of the parties at the date of hearing. secondly the court should identify and assess the contributions of the parties within the meaning of section 79(4)(a), (b) & (c) and determine the contribution based entitlements of the parties expressed as a percentage of the net value of the property of the parties. thirdly the court should identify and assess the relevant matters referred to in section 79(4) (d), (e), (f) & (g) (\u201cthe other factors\u201d) including, because of section 79(4), the matters referred to in section 75(2) so far as they are relevant and determine the adjustment study (if any) that should be made to the contribution based entitlements of the parties established at step two. fourthly, the court should consider the effect of those findings and determination and resolve what order is just and equitable in all the circumstances of the case. (citations omitted and emphasis added) application of the preferred approach step one: identify the property and liabilities jointly owned property mr tarabi\u2019s ($) value ms odawa\u2019s ($) value 1 the property 600,000 2 mortgage debt on the property 5,000) 3 water rates (from ms odawa\u2019s outline of case) ,362) 4 equity in the property 307,639 mr tarabi\u2019s \u2018keep\u2019 (assets he retains) 5 real or personal assets negligible 6 debts to various persons not included 7 total mr tarabi\u2019s \u2018keep\u2019 ms odawa\u2019s \u2018keep\u2019 (other assets she retains) 8 motor vehicle 1 (ms odawa\u2019s assertion not disputed) 24,000 9 household contents 15,000 10 total ms odawa\u2019s keep: 39,000 11 total assets and liabilities 322,639 346,639 superannuation mr tarabi\u2019s super\u2019n (mr tarabi\u2019s value not disputed) 27,900 wife\u2019s super\u2019n (ms odawa\u2019s position not disputed) nil total superannuation mr tarabi \u2018keep\u2019 (assets he retains) property purchased in country d mr tarabi\u2019s \u2018keep\u2019 motor vehicle 1 (ms odawa\u2019s estimate not disputed) some modest value ms odawa\u2019s interest in the business with her new partner not valued or know but of some real value 12 13 331,639 14 mr tarabi\u2019s super\u2019n (mr tarabi\u2019s estimate not disputed) ms odawa\u2019s super\u2019n (ms odawa\u2019s position not disputed) step two: section 90sm(4)(a), (b) & (c) contributions ] if it is necessary to make the point again, and to highlight it for the purpose of this appeal, we add our endorsement to what has been made clear... that the words of s 79 (and/o section 90sm) do not provide endorsement for any category of contribution related to any class of property (for example, high wealth) being, by virtue of that category or class, more valuable or important that another. in each case the contributions made by the parties must be evaluated in the context of the facts particular to that case. ] ... all contributions must be weighed collectively and so it is an error to segment or compartmentalise the various contributions and weigh one again the remainder. [36] that principle has a counterpart in the application factors prescribed in section 75(2) or section 90sm(3) of the act. any adjustment to the parties contribution-based- entitlements should be determined inclusively after considering all relevant factors, not by aggregating incremental adjustment in respect of each relevant factor. [citations omitted] the length of the marriage can be seen to be of considerable importance in the assessment of contributions. in our view, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, it should be inferred in proceedings pursuant to the provisions of s 79 that moneys howsoever received by a party during the course of the parties' cohabitation, are used by that party for the benefit of the family unit. such moneys, in those circumstances, thus constitute a financial contribution by the party who received the moneys.[6] ms morris: [mr tarabi], in 2015 just prior to you purchasing the house, you had quite a significant amount of money coming through in your income, sometimes $16,000 a fortnight. did you consider paying back those debts when you were bringing in that amount of money? ]mr tarabi]: no. because i was planning to buy a house as soon as i could. ms morris: over a period of, perhaps, six months you were bringing in that significant amount of money. that would have been, let\u2019s say, 30,000 at least a month. but the deposit that was paid was only seemingly about $56,000. is that correct? [mr tarabi]: yes, that\u2019s correct. yes. ms morris: so, effectively, we\u2019ve got a significant amount of money left over that you could have put towards these outstanding debts. is that right? [mr tarabi]: yes. but i was \u2013 the money \u2013 i did not use the money. i was stupid at the time. i was using that money on my \u2013 you know, on my family and the \u2013 and my in-laws. i was not only using that money on me. i do shopping and i give them the money sometimes to pay for the movies and things like that. so, really, i thought i was part of the \u2013 part of the family because i don\u2019t have any family member in australia with me except my kids and my in-laws. so i put myself as the child that is successful, maybe, at the time \u2013 i was thinking that i was going to be successful. so, therefore, it would have to be their son and call them my parents. but i don\u2019t know where \u2013 i did not know, whatsoever, that things would go this way. but guess what? things happen, and we learn from them. so, yeah, i made a mistake for not using those money properly. that was stupid of me. ms morris: in your affidavit you\u2019d said that you\u2019d paid to the wife\u2019s family roughly 35,000 at the start of the relationship in 2008 and 45,000 at the time of marriage as a form of dowry, is that correct? [mr tarabi]: yes. but that\u2019s not relevant, because it\u2019s not part of the thing \u2013 you know, not part of the thing that, you know, we\u2019re claiming here. ms morris: okay. around the time of the wedding, which is in 2011, 2012, you claim that you had paid 45,000 as a dowry, but you\u2019d also taken in loans? [mr tarabi]: yes. ms morris: at the time? [mr tarabi]: yes. ms morris: okay? [mr tarabi]: and, beside that, i have to give \u2013 you know, the in-laws, during the wedding, have to give the in-laws, when we talk, the traditional ..... talk. all the in-laws have to watch their mouth. the brothers-in-law, sisters-in-law, aunties, uncles \u2013 and i paid 35,000 \u2013 i put the $35,000 into the envelopes then, boom, gone. ms morris: okay. i \u2013 with respect to your bank statements of 2020, i think you provided perhaps three different bank statements. actually, i withdraw that: sorry, your honour. sorry, can you confirm, [mr tarabi], when you became unemployed? [mr tarabi]: i became unemployed in \u2013 when was that? actually, as soon as i \u2013 you know, like, it was in 2016, something \u2013 something like 2016. or, you know, until, maybe, early, you know, like let\u2019s say the first half of 2017. ms morris: okay. and so after you finished with [q company] around mid-2016, what did you \u2013 so you were unemployed after that period of time? [mr tarabi]: until, maybe, early \u2013 you know, like, let\u2019s say the first half of 2017. ms morris: okay. and, so, after you finished with [q company] around mid-2016, what did you \u2013 so you were unemployed after that period of time? [mr tarabi]: i was working. ms morris: what were you doing? [mr tarabi]: i was working in a factory in [town r]. it\u2019s a place \u2013 i don\u2019t think you know \u2013 you\u2019ve ever heard of it. ms morris: okay. and how long were you working there? [mr tarabi]: possibly around six months or so. something like six months or more than six months, yes. ms morris: okay. so that brings us to, maybe, the end of 2016 start of 2017? [mr tarabi]: yes. ms morris: and what did you do after that? [mr tarabi]: after that, did nothing. ms morris: so you\u2019ve been unemployed since 2017? [mr tarabi]: yes. ... ms morris: [in march], there\u2019s a cash deposit for $130. [march]\u2013 sorry, $450. april, $700. april, there\u2019s quite a number of small deposits, so $50, $60, $100, $100 and $500. and that\u2019s \u2013 so that\u2019s it for the period of march and april. are you able to comment on these cash deposits and where they came from? [mr tarabi]: yes, there are a few things: (1) people \u2013 you know, like, people send \u2013 you know, like, we have this thing called [t]. people put money \u2013 you know, like, people bring the money in to me \u2013 you know, to me, they can put money into the account, then i will take the money to the \u2013 you know, to the person responsible for [t]. sometimes, people, you know, just support me. they say, \u201c[mr tarabi],\u201d you know, like, \u201cthings are hard for you.\u201d they give me some money, put money into their \u2013 into the account to support me. so there are many activities. some people, you know, put money to the account so that i will take them to the people that send money to [country d], in [country d], in [country f], because we have these small companies of people that transfer money overseas. so what they \u2013 what these \u2013 what people do is, \u201c[mr tarabi], i will put money into your account, and then this money go and send them \u2013 send \u2013 send them in for me.\u201d so i do that. we have \u2013 in the community, we have some old \u2013 old women and old men, people who don\u2019t know, you know, like, how things operate. they \u2013 they \u2013 they just send me. so i \u2013 and the fact that i was not working, i was free to move around, they just, you know, send me here and there and do activities for them. ms morris: okay. so some of the money, you say, was given to you by other people so that you could send it to [country d]? [mr tarabi]: send them on their behalf, yes. ms morris: okay? [mr tarabi]: and some people, they send \u2013 put the \u2013 put the money into account to just support me because they know that i\u2019m struggling. step three: section 90sf(3) factors ...in any event it is the real impact in money terms which is ultimately the critical issue. on our adjusted figure for the value of the parties net assets ($1,503,863), adjustment of 10% in the wife\u2019s favour results in an increase in her entitlement of $150,386, and a corresponding reduction in the husband\u2019s entitlement, producing a differential movement between them of $300,772 ... 7] it is also important to recall what was said in phipson & phipson [2009] famcafc 28 when the full court was dealing with another appeal from the trial judge in the present proceedings: ] it is always important to keep in mind that an adjustment of x% for s 75(2) factors leads to a disparity in the value of property received by the parties representing 2 x x%. it is that disparity, measured in \u201cmoney terms\u201d, that requires consideration in determining whether the result is just and equitable: see campbell v kuskey [1998] famca 10, (1998) flc 92-795 at 84,928. 8] the 10% adjustment his honour made on account of s 75(2) factors has led to a disparity in favour of the wife equivalent in value to 20% of the assets. in money terms this represents $187,733 out of a total asset pool of $938,665. apart from the issues associated with the care, accommodation and maintenance of the children, the s 75(2) factors largely balanced out (save that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife would have more capital than the husband). the husband was going to have whatever responsibility remained for the care, accommodation and maintenance of j. both parties would have significant responsibility for the two younger children. it is true the wife will have the children with her about 20% more of the time than the husband, but this amounts to only a little more than 70 additional days a year. [109] in our view an assessment leading to a disparity of $187,733 in the capital/superannuation to be received by each party was outside the reasonable ambit of the trial judge\u2019s broad discretion, even taking into account the matters found by his honour relating to the non-payment of child support in the period after the husband gave up his employment. our conclusion is sufficient to enliven appellate intervention (house v the king (1936) 55 clr 499 and norbis v norbis [1986] hca 17, (1986) 161 clr 513). the appeal will therefore be allowed. ... [112] in our view, given that the children will be with him around 40% of the time, the husband\u2019s accommodation needs for the children would not be significantly different to those of the wife. however, in light of the agreement in relation to child support, we accept that the wife will bear the greater proportion of the burden of maintaining the two younger children (at least for the time being). the husband, on the other hand, will have whatever responsibility remains for accommodating and maintaining j. the other s 75(2) factors, in our view, are evenly balanced, save for the fact that as a result of the assessment of contributions the wife will have 4% (or $37,546) more of the assets/superannuation than the husband. [113] taking these matters into account, and the failure of the husband to pay child support after giving up his employment, we consider there should be a 4% adjustment for s 75(2) factors, creating a disparity of 8% between the parties \u2013 or in money terms an amount of $75,093. 9] in our view, s 79(4)(e) requires those matters to be taken into account in arriving at orders that are just and equitable as between the parties. in arriving at an appropriate assessment for those factors, a dollar value of it should be uppermost in our minds [79] and, of course, the ultimate disparity in entitlements which it might produce. that dollar value is, in turn, dependent upon the value of the interests in property of the parties. age and state of health income, property, financial resources and capacity for employment care of children under 18 years commitment of each of the parties to support themselves or a child responsibilities of either party to support any other person pension or benefit reasonable standard of living would maintenance assist education or training effect on creditors effect of a party contributing to the earning capacity and property of the other duration of marriage and the extent any earning capacity has been affected protect parties\u2019 role as a parent whether party cohabiting with another person child support to be provided any fact or circumstance required to take into account conclusion as to section 90sf(3) factors step four: just and equitable and conclusion conclusion - property associate: dated: 3 november 2023 dated: 3 november 2023 [1] counsel for the icl specifically relied upon [18] and [19] in the final hearing.[2] see tp-107.[3] see tp-108.[4] tp 243 i june 2022.[5] in assessing section 90sm(4) contributions, i also acknowledge and apply dickons & dickons [2012] famcafc 154 (\u2018dickons\u2019) at [24], hurst & hurst [2018] famcafc 146; (2018) flc 93-851 (\u2018hurst\u2019) at [23], lovine & connor and anor (2012) flc 93-515, [2012] famcafc 168 (\u2018lovine & connor\u2019) at [40] to [42].[6] see parshen, 83665.

and january 2023, my previous solicitors and [the husband\u2019s] lawyers undertook negotiations regarding our property matter. as part of these negotiations we agreed to sell [suburb c] as soon as possible. around 9 november 2022, [the husband\u2019s] lawyers and my previous solicitors reached what was an in-principle agreement regarding our property settlement based on our without prejudice communication. around 9 november 2022, my previous solicitor drafted and provided to [the husband\u2019s] lawyers a draft minute of consent orders. around 23 november 2022, my previous solicitor received a response from [the husband\u2019s] lawyers regarding the draft proposed minute of consent orders. [...] in [late] 2022, after [the husband] and i had agreed to place [suburb c] on the market for sale and for the sale to occur as soon as possible. i relocated and moved into rental accommodation. i wanted to remain in the property, however, i was under the impression that i needed to relocate before it was placed on the market and once the intervention order expired. despite moving out of the property, i continued to pay for the outgoings and utilities of the property and continued to be responsible for the maintenance and upkeep. i prepared the house for the sale and maintained the gardens in preparing it for sale. the draft settlement documents prepared by [the husband\u2019s] lawyers and my previous solicitors were draft versions only. they were never signed by [the husband] or i nor filed with this honourable court. on 16 february 2023, i instructed my new lawyers [...] to write to [the husband\u2019s] lawyers to confirm that i withdrew all of the previous offers. i wanted to continue with negotiations after obtaining new legal advice. part performance of the agreement in pursuance of the agreement: the former home was formally placed on the market on or about [early] 2023 and subsequently sold. the agent was appointed by [the wife] and the sale was pretty much coordinated by her in conjunction with the agent. on the advice of the agent, and in order to maximise the sale price of the former home, i painted the interior of the home and. i spent 14 days undertaking that work. [...] the sale of the former home settled [in mid-] 2023 and the net proceeds of sale, now being $1,[300,000], after some jointly agreed withdrawals, are currently held in a controlled monies account... if it had not been for that agreement, i would not have expended as much time and energy preparing the property for sale or, indeed, agreed to it being then put up for sale. ... i disagree that there was part performance of any agreement. we both agreed neither could afford to buy the other out and retain the property. agreement was reached that the property be sold. i was living in the property at the time and paying the outgoings. i had to secure alternative rental accommodation as a consequence of selling the property. he acknowledged, as conveyed via his lawyers\u2019 correspondence of 7 march 2023, the wife\u2019s right to \u201cwalk away\u201d before the agreement was \u201censhrined in court orders\u201d, (b) he acknowledged via his counsel, only a financial agreement made under the act could be binding, and (c) his counsel confirmed the husband sought an alteration of property interests between the parties and was not seeking to rely on the asserted agreement to contend that it was not just and equitable for there to be an alteration of property interests pursuant to section 79(2). he acknowledged via his counsel, only a financial agreement made under the act could be binding, and (c) his counsel confirmed the husband sought an alteration of property interests between the parties and was not seeking to rely on the asserted agreement to contend that it was not just and equitable for there to be an alteration of property interests pursuant to section 79(2). his counsel confirmed the husband sought an alteration of property interests between the parties and was not seeking to rely on the asserted agreement to contend that it was not just and equitable for there to be an alteration of property interests pursuant to section 79(2). it is only possible to oust the jurisdiction of the court by final order or a qualifying financial agreement (and previously by approved maintenance agreement), an agreement other than a financial agreement will be relevant as evidence of what the parties intended and of the financial arrangements in place at the time and subsequently, in that sense any agreement is relevant but not in and of itself determinative. in determining s 79 applications in circumstances where there has been an earlier agreement, it will often be necessary to consider what was the value of the parties\u2019 assets at the time of the agreement, what their various contributions were to that time, and what might have been an appropriate s 75(2) adjustment. a consideration of these matters might well be necessary in order to provide a background to the parties\u2019 understanding of what was a just and equitable settlement at the time. however, and perhaps more significantly, it would generally be necessary for the court to acquaint itself with changes in the composition and value of the property pool, so that post-separation contributions can be assessed. legal principles exclusion of evidence of settlement negotiations (1) evidence is not to be adduced of: (a) a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute, or (b) a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute. a communication that is made between persons in dispute, or between one or more persons in dispute and a third party, in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of the dispute, or (b) a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute. a document (whether delivered or not) that has been prepared in connection with an attempt to negotiate a settlement of a dispute. the substance of the evidence has been partly disclosed with the express or implied consent of the persons in dispute, and full disclosure of the evidence is reasonably necessary to enable a proper understanding of the other evidence that has already been adduced, or ...

the husband\u2019s solicitors, an asserted summary of assets and liabilities as at august 2022. that summary included the assets identified by the parties in the joint balance sheet at the final hearing, albeit with different values. counsel for the husband did not make any submissions at the conclusion of the hearing as to how this evidence had any bearing on my determination of the issues in dispute, (b) paragraph 28(e) of the husband\u2019s trial affidavit deposed to procedural fairness being afforded to the trustee of the husband\u2019s superannuation fund. that paragraph referred to annexure e6 which consists of a letter dated 6 december 2022 sent to the trustee of the husband\u2019s superannuation fund and an enclosed minute of proposed orders which the letter advised had been agreed between the parties, (c) the minute of proposed orders annexed at e6 contemplated (among other things) the sale of suburb c, the terms and conditions of sale and for the net proceeds of sale to

contributions of all types made by each of the parties in the context of their particular relationship (dickons & dickons [2012] famcafc 154). as was also said by the full court in lovine & connor and anor [2012] famcafc 168, at paragraphs 40 and 41 such an evaluation \u201cinevitably involves value judgments and matters of impression\u201d, and accordingly it cannot be treated as \u201ca mathematical exercise\u201d. and by counsel for the wife referring to full court\u2019s decision in horrigan & horrigan:[13] it is well established that an assessment of contributions is not a mathematical exercise, but rather involves the identification and assessment of all of the parties\u2019 respective contributions, in a holistic way across the course of the relationship and in the

initial contributions by a party with all other relevant contributions of both the husband and the wife. in considering the weight to be attached to the initial contribution, in this case of the husband, regard must be had to the use made by the parties of that contribution. in our view, talk of \u201cerosion\u201d of the early capital contribution obscures the issue rather than illuminates it. however, it can be taken as well settled that the length of the relationship has a significant impact on how early significant capital contributions should be viewed in assessing the totality of the parties\u2019 contributions. for example, the full court has said: the longer the duration of the marriage, depending on the quality and extent of her contribution, the more the proportionality of the original contribution is reduced. and the longer the marriage the more likely it is that there will be later factors of significance, and in the ultimate the exercise is to weigh the original contribution with all other, later, factors and those later factors, whether equal or not, may in the circumstances of the individual case reduce the significance of the original contribution. ferences omitted] it will be clear from the passages that we have referred to that his honour rejected an argument that there was a particular type of contribution that related to \u201cspecial skills\u201d or \u201cspecial talents\u201d, with the result that such a finding \u201cis productive of a particular finding, or range of findings in respect of contribution\u201d. full court decisions have supported that view (see kane & kane [2013] famcafc 205, hoffman & hoffman [2014] famcafc 92) and the jurisprudence can be fairly said to be settled. section 79(4)(d) matters relevant

judgment judge myers: whilst we all know about no fault divorce our client is in possession of your client's phone and has accessed all the material which has been deleted and stored on the hard drive. the material consists of many explicit photographs, text messages and can only be described as highly disturbing in the setting of what our client considered to be a loving marriage based upon mutual trust and respect. literally hundreds of explicit text messages, emails and photographs passing between yourself and ([ms d]) over a protracted period of time. lurid obscene and pornographic material that [ms chatwin] has had to confront. in my opinion, there needs to be a significant display of contrition, remorse and repentance on your client's behalf if he is ever to win the trust of [ms chatwin] again. words will not suffice, only actions of the self-sacrificial nature outlined herein. in the event, that in the fullness of time, the relationship can be re-established and the parties reunite then of course the property settlement will be rendered null and void. if reconciliation does not eventuate the property settlement will stand and will not be conditional upon there being counselling or a reconciliation.....if your client is prepared to explore the remote possibility of making up for his misdeeds and to agree to the course outlined herein please advise and i shall encourage [ms chatwin] to participate under the guidance of her counsellor. there are numerous aspects of your letter which clearly breach your professional obligations. the letter certainly does nothing to assist the amicable and dignified resolution of the issues. in particular, your correspondence constitutes a breach of the following: the general principles of professional conduct and rule 13, 2 and 30 of the professional conduct and practice rules 2005, which require, inter alia, the avoidance of personal bias and/or opinion and the use of offensive and provocative language, section 12a of the family law act 1975 (cth), which requires practitioners to assist parties where a reconciliation may be possible, not create impediments, sections 2.1 and 2.2 of the best practice guidelines for lawyers doing family law work, which require the avoidance of inflammatory exchanges and the consideration of the effect of correspondence upon clients and other family members. your repeated further reference in your letter of 1 august 2013 and almost every prior item of correspondence to photographs and the like obtained by your client which are \"in your possession\" (and which on our instructions were circulated by your client to family members and our client's professional colleagues) also smacks of blackmail. our client offers your firm the opportunity to withdraw from acting for [ms chatwin]. if you refuse to do so, our client will give further consideration to a formal misconduct complaint. ...having transferred all the information contained thereon to her phone and thereby maintained a permanent record of the text message and photographs passing between your client and ([ms d]). if your client is precious regarding any allegation made against him he ought to be more discreet in his choice of holiday locations. 2. purpose and effect of the rules 2.1 the purpose of these rules is to assist solicitors to act ethically and in accordance with the principles of professional conduct established by the common law and these rules. 2.2 in considering whether a solicitor has engaged in unsatisfactory conduct or professional misconduct, the rules apply in addition to the common law. 4. other fundamental ethical duties 4.1 a solicitor must also: 4.1.1 act in the best interests of a client in any matter in which the solicitor represents the client, 4.1.2 be honest and courteous in all dealings in the course of legal practice, 4.1.3 deliver legal services competently, diligently and promptly as reasonably possible, 4.1.4 avoid any compromise to their integrity and professional independence, and 4.1.5 comply with these rules and the law. b] will be called to give evidence about a controversial matter, being the circumstances in which the financial agreement was negotiated and prepared. further, he may be questioned about the contents of the financial agreement and its drafting. 27. solicitor as material witness in client\u2019s case 27.1 in a case in which it is known, or becomes apparent, that a solicitor will be required to give evidence material to the determination of contested issues before the court, the solicitor may not appear as advocate for the client in the hearing. 27.2 in a case in which it is known, or becomes apparent, that a solicitor will be required to give evidence material to the determination of contested issues before the court the solicitor, an associate of the solicitor or a law practice of which the solicitor is a member must not continue to act for the client if doing so would prejudice the administration of justice. i do not accept that the mere circumstance that a solicitor will be a material witness, even on a controversial matter, of itself justifies restraining the solicitor from continuing to act....that line is crossed only when the solicitor has a personal stake in the outcome of the proceedings or in their conduct beyond the recovery of proper fees for acting, albeit that the relevant stake may not necessarily be financial, but involves the personal or reputational interest of the solicitor, as will be the case if his or her conduct and integrity come under attack and review in the proceedings. the presence of such circumstances will be a strong indication that the interests of justice \u2013 which in this field involve clients being represented by independent and objective lawyers unfettered by concerns about their own interests \u2013 require the lawyer to be restrained from continuing to act. ] the correct test that should have been applied by the primary judge, in determining whether a legal practitioner should be restrained from acting on behalf of a party, is that which is adumbrated by the full court of the federal court of australia (besanko, lee and abraham jj) in porter v dyer (2022) 402 alr 659 who applied, with approval, the following statement of principle by griffiths j in mumbin v northern territory of australia (no 1) [2020] fca 475: the relevant principles which guide the exercise of the court\u2019s separate discretion are broadly as follows: (a) the court has an inherent jurisdiction to ensure the due administration of justice, to protect the integrity of the judicial process and to restrain legal practitioners from acting in a particular case as part of its supervisory jurisdiction (see, for example, grimwade v meagher

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 13 december 2023 federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2) chabon & keefe (no 2) [2023] fedcfamc2f 1382 orders the court orders that: reasons for judgment judge murdoch introduction background the parties\u2019 proposals the evidence the child the parties this binary view of family violence is outmoded and has no place in modern family law. in our view her evidence that she sought to preserve the family unit and to protect z without the involvement of these agencies was neither incredible nor inconsistent with her evidence of her history of family violence. the lay witnesses the family report the legal principles the benefit to the child of having a meaningful relationship with both of the child\u2019s parents, and (b) the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. the need to protect the child from physical or psychological harm from being subjected to, or exposed to, abuse, neglect or family violence. ] ...whilst s 60cc(2a) demands that greater weight be given to the consideration in s 60cc(2)(b) \u2013 something entirely consistent with the approach of the courts since the commencement of the act \u2013 the particular facts and circumstances of each individual case nevertheless require a careful evaluation and balancing of considerations, and all the more so when what is at stake is the potential for a child to never know their parent. the primary considerations meaningful relationship ...should consider and weigh the evidence at the date of the hearing and determine how, if it is in a child\u2019s best interests, orders can be framed to ensure the particular child has a meaningful relationship with both parents... 2] ...no doubt in the majority of cases there will be a positive benefit to a child of having a significant relationship with both parents, but there will also be some cases where there will be no positive benefit to be derived by a child by a court attempting to craft orders to foster a relationship with one parent if this would not be in the child\u2019s best interests. family violence inconsistency having thus been established, the totality of the evidence as to family violence was then evaluated as unreliable. no attempt was made to identify a core consistency in what she said. amongst other things, this approach fails to recognise how hard it is for victims of violence inflicted by a family member, who is often someone they love or on whom they rely for sustenance, to speak about what has happened. the subject matter is distressing and giving voice to what has occurred can be traumatic in itself. we cannot say strongly enough that those involved in cases such as this must bear in mind that in this setting, disclosure is a process that often requires time before a complete picture emerges. he probative value of a particular piece of evidence should not be considered in isolation from the rest of the evidence, including the proposed evidence. this is particularly so where the court is asked to draw an inference from all of the evidence, that is to say, all of the circumstances of the matter. this is because one piece of evidence may affect the probative value of another and a number of pieces of evidence when considered together may have a probative value greater than if each is considered individually. the father\u2019s allegations the mother\u2019s allegations the incident of late 2017 i recall feeling very upset and frightened as i spoke to the police. i said to the police: \u2018i don\u2019t want you to take any action against [the father] i just want him to stop hitting me.\u2019[4] the incident of mid-2020 domestic violence [...] swelling and tenderness reason for contact: injury \u2013 face .... domestic violence husband hit her a few hours ago [swelling and tenderness] bruise noted pot is crying ... advised to inform police feeling hopeless [6] risk of abuse and/or neglect the additional considerations any views expressed by x immediately said that he did not want to see his father. he agreed to talk about his school and his mother, but repeated several times that he did not wish to discuss [the father]. [14] as in the cic, [the child] declined to talk about [the father], except to say that he did not want to see him. he declined to discuss his reasons for this when asked. when asked what [the mother] thought about him spending time with [the father], he said \u201cmum never said anything to me\u201d.[15] the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with the parties and other significant persons she said that he has expressed anxiety about leaving [ms keefe] alone in the house. she said that he becomes fearful if someone is shouting, or even if someone simply talks loudly, and she has to explain to him that sometimes people just raise their voices. she said that he gave away his [toy] when another child shouted at him, because he was afraid of consequences of this. so, generally, our priority is the wellbeing of children. in that interview, if it\u2019s \u2013 and it\u2019s their choice if they speak to us or not, if they offer a view or not. so, whilst we will encourage children to speak about things that they might be reluctant to speak about and, obviously, we have ways of trying to make children comfortable, ultimately we don\u2019t pressure them to speak about things that they wish not to speak about. the capacity of each parent to provide for x\u2019s needs and their demonstrated attitude to x and the responsibilities of parenthood. father: i know [x]. he doesn\u2019t hate me that much that he will have this bad behaviour, but i will try my best to resolve that and build that sort of relationship. her honour: how are you going to do that on a practical basis? father: i will initially try myself to improve that relationship because i know those things which makes him happy but if there are issues, he is really very fond of his grandfather and grandmother and if needed i will try to get them here so he can spend time as well. her honour: your parents are in [country b]? father: yes, but they have a valid visa until 2025. the extent to which the parents have taken the opportunity to participate in making decisions about major long-term issues or spend time or communicate with x financial support of x the likely effect of any changes in x\u2019s circumstances quite low and that his expectation that they might resume a relationship were quite unrealistic and likely to cause distress to [x] if he was placed in that situation. the practical difficulty and expense of a child spending time with a parent whether it would be preferable to make an order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings in relation to x discussion and disposition parental responsibility adjournment and family therapy time with orders ...suffer insecurity, fear, unhappiness, anxiety and hypervigilance from witnessing abusive behaviour of a parent. such effects present a threat to their emotional development. probably the worst danger to children is the role model that a violent parent provides which can lead to children themselves coming to suffer the serious social disability of using violence in their dealings with other people including those they love. such a disability can destroy the most intimate relationships and bring the person into conflict with other people, the police and the law... if [ms keefe\u2019s] account of family violence is found to have veracity, ongoing contact with [mr chabon] is likely to place [x] at risk of exposure to further aggression and violence perpetrated by [mr chabon] and of being subjected to harsh parenting practises, such as physical aggression and an intolerance of age appropriate behaviours. in this case it is recommended that [x] spend no time with [mr chabon].[24] this evidence was confirmed by the court child expert during the course of her oral evidence. it was not successfully challenged and i accept it. chabon\u2019s] suggestion that he was asked to do anger management and men\u2019s behaviour change courses due to [x\u2019s] views, rather than the allegations of family violence, may suggest an inability or unwillingness to reflect on his own behaviours and the impacts of such behaviours on [ms keefe] and [x].[25] having said that, if your client does not intend to participate in the \"taking responsibility\" course in accordance with the orders, i do not say that any non-compliance should hold up the listing of this matter for final hearing. in my view, ultimately it will form part of the evidence before the court and the parties may make submissions to the court as to what (if any) inferences should be drawn from the father's participation or non-participation. counsel: you\u2019re asking for there to be no contact at all between the father and [x], no face-to-face contact, no telephone contact, nothing? mother: yes. counsel: how long do you say that should be the case for? mother: like i can\u2019t say anything now because he is growing and i don\u2019t know for how long he will feel fear inside. maybe he needs some time to \u2013 i can\u2019t say anything now for how long. counsel: okay, but you\u2019re not asking for two or three years, you\u2019re asking for an order until he\u2019s 18, is that right? mother: like, i think that\u2019s the best time when he confident and he can do \u2013 counsel: correct me if i\u2019m wrong, but i got the impression from some of the answers you gave to mr fantin in his questions that if [x] was okay with seeing his father you\u2019d be okay with it as well? mother: yes if he feels okay then it\u2019s okay for me unless he is have [inaudible] and no stress and tension. ... counsel why are you asking the court to make orders for no contact? tell us in your own words please? mother: it\u2019s only because for [x\u2019s] safety and for [x]. ... counsel his safety from what? mother: like, he feel safe and he feel confident, he don\u2019t stress \u2013 counsel no, you said it\u2019s for [x\u2019s] safety, i want to ask you, his safety from what? mother: like as he feels scared from his father... so like if he feel safe, then he can. counsel are you saying that the only reason you want no contact is because he\u2019s saying he\u2019s scared of his father? mother: yeah he\u2019s not feeling safe and he\u2019s scared from him. so, there are advantages to a child having contact with a parent, obviously. it\u2019s important for a child to be aware of their \u2013 their identify and their heritage. if they can have a positive relationship with a parent that \u2013 that is a \u2013 a good and useful thing. in this particular case, what we know, that a relationship with a perpetrator of coercive and controlling violence can have a negative impact on a child\u2019s mental health. it can lead to them having \u2013 having distorted and concerning views of relationships as they grow up and it can have serious negative effects. also, the lack of insight that [mr chabon] showed during our interviews in regard to understanding how difficult that a reunion might be for [x] and being able to consider ways that he might need to repair that relationship suggested to me that it\u2019s unlikely that that would be a positive relationship for [x]. injunctive orders travel overseas orders costs of the independent children\u2019s lawyer conclusion associate: dated: 10 november 2023 dated: 10 november 2023 [1] family report dated 29 september 2021, paragraphs 36 and 38 (\u201cfamily report\u201d).

sensory/emotional responses if re-exposed to aggression, conflict and intense emotion, thus reinforcing their anxieties that their world is unsafe. they may also have poorer longer-term outcomes in respect to their emotional/mental health, cognitive and emotional development, learning, peer relationships, coping mechanisms, and overall capacity to thrive. [x] may also be sensitively attuned to and impacted by any residual and/or renewed anxieties and fears experienced by [ms slade] because she is his primary carer.[8] both parties alleged that the other has been the instigator/perpetrator of the violence between them and they have acted only in self-defence or when feeling emotionally pressured because of the other's behaviour.[9] pending the judgment delivery, commencing monday 4 september 2023, the father will spend time with the child each monday from 9.00am to 3.00pm with the first 3 hours to take place at [b venue] at [c street, suburb d] with the handover into the father\u2019s care to occur at [b venue] and the handover at the end of the father\u2019s time to occur at [suburb e] police station.[16] while [mr marshman] did not present as being as attuned to or prioritising of [x\u2019s] needs as did [ms slade], he conveyed that he dearly loves him, is committed to being significantly involved in his life, and has different strengths/gifts to offer. the pace at which time- spending is now increased is likely to challenge his expectations/wishes and cause him frustration, which he may require support in managing in a constructive manner. he conveyed a limited understanding of [x\u2019s] developmental needs, including the emotional/psychological demands associated with him separating from [ms slade] to spend increasing amounts of time with him in what will initially be an unfamiliar environment.[17] both parents identified that in moving forward, their main concerns relate to a generalised mistrust/unknowing of what the other may do to cause further trouble/drama, rather than concrete concerns regarding further physical violence and their own safety. family violence is not considered a risk factor while the current injunctions/restraints remain in place and the parents don\u2019t have substantial renewed contact.[18] marshman] would benefit greatly by receiving support to develop his broader parenting awareness/knowledge and skills-base in areas such as the care requirements of a three year old regarding routine/sleep/diet, and how to recognise the signs that a child is experiencing separation anxiety and support them.[20] the parties have each indicated a willingness to undertake such counselling and, in this context, the icl has designated a number of courses which she believes will assist mr marshman.[21] a realistic, optimal outcome for [x] at this point in time would be that through spending increasing time with his father at a pace he can manage, they (he and [mr marshman]) will forge a more trusting/involved relationship, that the parents will each separately engage with a psychologist/counsellor to address their issues and improve their co-parenting relations in order to communicate appropriately about child-related matters, and [mr marshman] will seek to further develop his parenting understandings/skills.[22] background in or around november 2021 i insisted that the father and i separate. he pleaded with me to give him another chance, and that he would sell the [business] so that he could return to work and contribute to the household expenses. we agreed that he could remain living in my house so that the child could have both parents under the same roof, and that he would pay half the household bills and do half of the housework. i also asked the father to sign paperwork with centrelink to ensure that my parenting payments would not be cut off once the father started working in the paid workforce. he refused to do so and kept insisting that i give him another chance in the relationship. i told the father that we could continue to live separated under the same roof, and that we could see how things worked out between us. the father claimed that it would be fraudulent if l claimed centrelink benefits whilst we were both living under the same roof.[23] .]2018 - domestic abuse offence - police were called in relation to a domestic disturbance. on arrival police established that [mr marshman] and [ms slade] had become involved in a heated verbal argument over their finances. during argument, [ms slade] reportedly tried to leave the house in an attempt to de-escalate, with [mr marshman] reportedly attempting to prevent her from doing so as he wanted to continue arguing. whilst [ms slade] was trying to leave the house she reportedly slapped [mr marshman]to the right side of his face, and then whilst trying to close front door has caused [damage to the door]. [ms slade] managed to leave house, and then called for police mediation from her car down the street. no visible injuries to [mr marshman] only soreness. police noted that [mr marshman] did not call police or want any intervention. in a follow up with [mr marshman], he stated that he and [ms slade] had discussed the issues and that he believed they had resolved them. [mr marshman] stated he knew he did the wrong thing by stopping [ms slade] from leaving, and that he knew that was what one of them should do. [mr marshman] advised that they had been to a counselling session [...] and that he thinks things had been better since then. i really cant take this anymore. dealing with you is exhausting whst ever. yea i explode and being a bitch again fine you want to talk and me listen even if you say what i am not agree with but when i start talk then you not agree what i am saying then you intrupe me i have to hang up 3 times i told you we better don\u2019t talk now but you keep going ok i will not come home and you can think or believe what you want over one thing i said about the dogs you need to fix your attitude. i cant take it anymore i hqve been doing most of the house work taking the dogs out everyday before we move here. you\u2019ve been only been doing it for 2 mo ths and you\u2019re already giving me attitude i really cant take it anymore [mr marshman] you want me to hit you again coz you keep defending yourself sorry i didn\u2019t meant this i am just exhausted emotionally and need help[33] .]2019 - domestic abuse non offence \u2013 [ms slade] attended a police station to seek some advice about domestic abuse. [ms slade] stated she had been in a relationship with [mr marshman] for about 3 years. she moved over from [country s] 17 years ago and met him in adelaide. she has no other friends or relatives here. they had no children together at time of reporting, they co-own a [business]. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] antagonizes her sometimes, which leads to her becoming very frustrated. [ms slade] advised that this might happen once every couple of weeks, however the behaviour had escalated in the last few months. [ms slade] stated that about a year ago, [mr marshman\u2019s] taunting became so bad that she hit him to the face. police were called, attending patrols advised the parties consider counselling. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] did not want to attend counselling and that they stopped trying to work through the relationship. [ms slade] stated that today at home a verbal altercation ensued over minor issues. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] was very rude and they were both saying they were 'on the edge'. [mr marshman] reportedly stormed off and grabbed the cash for the [business], at which point [ms slade] slapped him across the face. [ms slade] stated that she feels on-edge all the time, and is having other life problems. she stated that she didn't want to hit [mr marshman] but stated that she just loses control sometimes. [ms slade] advised that she sometimes hits herself instead, hits her head against the wall or wardrobe. [ms slade] stated that [mr marshman] had hit her once after she slapped him. [ms slade] stated that [ms marshman] subjected her to ongoing psychological abuse and taunting. [ms slade] stated that she was at a loss and didn't know what to do or where to turn. she had no support in sa and did not want to return to [country s]. police made a follow up call with [ms slade], in which she stated that a lot had happened since she reported, and that things were improving. [ms slade] advised that both her and her husband have endured family tragedy and business stresses, both at their [business] and through her own employment [...]. [ms slade] explained that she had left her job and planned to spend more time at their [business]. [ms slade] explained that she and [mr marshman] had talked a lot this week and examined what their stresses were. [ms slade] had been seeing her gp and is now on a mh plan and on prescribed anti-depressants. she indicated that her stress levels had already reduced now that she has finished her job as this was her primary cause of stress. she added that maybe financial worries would now arise but so far things were much better. police offered further supports/ links, however [ms slade] declined. contact details provided for further assistance/ advice. the evidence slade] conveyed that given her background as previously described wherein she assumed responsibility for her own survival/well-being and was independent from a very young age, she has a low tolerance for feeling disempowered or used by others, commenting, \u2018i\u2019m not a woman [...] in [country q], i\u2019m not the type of person to be controlled\u2019. she acknowledged there were times when she became extremely angry and retaliatory, commenting, \u2018i\u2019d get up and shove him back to show him you can\u2019t do that to me, another time i scratched the hell out of him\u2019. she asserted that in retrospect, she now believes there were times [mr marshman] manipulated her into reacting in order to create a narrative that she was abusing him. [ms slade] conveyed she is unembarrassed by her reactions, believing she was entitled to respond as she did even though this contributed to an escalating cycle of conflict and their current impasse. she said in the end, she was less invested in their relationship surviving and just wanted to \u2018get out\u2019.[38] shared care arrangement requires a higher level of cooperation and goodwill between parents to manage/coordinate the many practical aspects involved. as previously noted, the parties presented as having continued high levels of mistrust of each other and a reasonable risk of re-engaging in conflict should they come into regular contact again. [ms slade] conveyed a more realistic understanding that [x\u2019s] time with his father should be incrementally increased. ... she suggested that when unsupervised contact commences, it should initially occur at a public facility such as a dedicated play centre/caf\u00e9 which replicates the environment of the \u2018contact centre\u2019 where [x] has recently been used to seeing his father. [ms slade] is also likely to be more reassured if unsupervised contact commences in this way, which in turn will support [x] to feel confident and thereby to separate from her with greater ease. [ms slade\u2019s] proposal that a third party should be present at changeovers (such as at a police station or other public venue) is realistic given the parties\u2019 history of conflict, relative non-resolution of their relationship dynamics and respective, on-going concerns. as previously noted, further occurrences of overt conflict with [x] present will potentially negatively impact his

psychological harm from being subjected to or exposed to abuse, neglect or family violence. aving a meaningful relationship with both parents is but one part of a set of arrangements that makes up a care arrangement. all parts of the arrangement must be considered before deciding what outcome is in the child\u2019s best interests.[47] iolent, threatening or other behaviour by a person that coerces or controls a member of the person\u2019s family, or causes the family member to be fearful. they are terrified and simultaneously come to accept it as an expected part of life, they may learn that violence is acceptable behaviour and an integral part of intimate relationships, or that violence and fear can be used to exert control over family members, they may suffer significant emotional trauma from fear, anxiety, confusion, anger, helplessness and disruption in their lives, they may have higher levels of aggression than children who do not have that exposure, and they may suffer from higher anxiety, more behaviour problems and lower self-esteem than children not exposed to violence. clinical profiles for children who witness domestic violence include post-traumatic play, diminished ability to regulate affect in the forms of hyper-arousal, numbness, emotional constriction, a low frustration threshold, nightmares and other sleep disturbances, aggressive behaviours, intense and multiple fears, regression in developmental achievements, and disturbances in peer relations.[53] the nature of the risk is best expressed by the term \u2018unacceptable risk\u2019. it is an evaluation of the nature and degree of the risk and whether, with or without safeguards, it is acceptable.[57] ...it is not unreasonable for the court to take into account in assessing whether an unacceptable risk exists, the need of a custodial parent to be assured of the children\u2019s protection. as primary caregiver, anxiety about the children\u2019s exposure to potential harm is likely to impact adversely on that parent\u2019s ability to care for the children. whilst parental responsibility is vaguely defined, some insight into what is needed from a parent can be seen in s 65dac(3) which provides that if both parents have that responsibility, they are taken to be required to consult about parenting issues and make a genuine effort to come to a joint decision. it will again be remembered that the focus of the objects and principles in this act is on joint parenting.[73] s a broad concept as described in s 61b and that task covers many things. parents are expected jointly to endeavour to promote their children\u2019s development by ensuring they have the greatest potential in adulthood whilst at the same time enjoying the security of childhood they deserve.[74] determining the best interests of the child \u2013 section 60cc a) the primary considerations or very young children of [x\u2019s] age, while they are unlikely to remember the actual experience/s, the impact is often expressed through behaviours such as increased clinginess and separation anxiety, disturbed sleep patterns, regressive toileting/eating habits, generalised irritability, and a hypersensitivity to raised voices/conflict. this can impact their development/learning, emotional/psychological health and overall functioning which over time, can result in inappropriate coping responses such as emotional/physical dysregulation and/or withdrawal, anxiety and depression throughout childhood, adolescence and possibly into young adulthood.[76] it is also acknowledged that behavioural disturbances can arise for children (particularly when they are as young as [x]) when their parents are significantly estranged, as is the case for [mr marshman] and [ms slade]. this is because they (children) are exquisitely attuned to their parents\u2019 unresolved feelings of anger, distress and fear towards one another, and of resultant tensions within the co-parenting relationship. for a child of [x\u2019s] age, this is again typically expressed through regressive behaviours such as those noted above, especially when the child is regularly transitioning between the parents\u2019 households.[77] the additional considerations a) the child\u2019s views b) the nature of the child\u2019s relationship with each of his parents and significant others c) the extent to which each of the parents has taken or failed to take the opportunity to be involved in decision making and to spend time or communicate with the child ca) provision of financial support for the child d) the effect of change e) the practical difficulties and expense of the child spending time and communicating with each of his parents f) the capacity of each of the child\u2019s parents and other persons to provide for the emotional and intellectual needs of the childi) the attitude to the child and to the responsibilities of parenthood, demonstrated by each of the parties marshman] conveyed that because [x] is comfortable playing with him within a contained/structured environment for short periods, this reflects sufficient bonding for them to progress to an arrangement of shared care. in general, [mr marshman] demonstrated limited insight in respect to [x\u2019s] needs vis a vis his own in terms of [x\u2019s] age/stage of development and the limited nature of their recent contact.[79] she conveyed a level of self-reflection in respect of her own approach, such as wanting to balance when she steps in to help/protect [x] or allows him space and opportunity to problem-solve on his own. she said she is also learning how to play games with him, commenting she believes she will find this easier as he grows older and can engage in sporting activities together. [ms slade] conveyed she is a dedicated, conscientious parent who has high self-expectations in her parenting of [x]. she said she is pleased with his progress, commenting that he is happy, smart and playful, can think for himself and is appropriately cautious.[80] g) the child\u2019s maturity, sex, lifestyle and background h) aboriginal heritage j) family violencek) any family violence order l) whether it would be preferable to make the order that would be least likely to lead to the institution of further proceedings conclusions associate: dated: 10 november 2023 dated: 10 november 2023 [1] hereinafter referred to as \u201cthe act\u201d.[2] see orders dated 23 may 2022.

{"inputs": {"content": "last updated: 23 january 2024 federal circuit and family court of australia ision 2) renner & renner [2023] fedcfamc2f 1499 orders on a final basis, the court orders that: reasons for judgment judge w j neville introduction applicant\u2019s orders sought and it is noted that an amended schedule of costs is annexed, along with a calculation of costs on scale respondent\u2019s orders sought written submissions on behalf of the applicant background this is an application in a proceeding for costs, pursuant to rule 10.03 of the federal circuit and family court of australia (family law) rules 2021 (fcfcoa rules) and filed within 28 days of the father discontinuing his application for interim and final parenting orders. the father's initiating application filed on 3 november 2022 was discontinued on 22 may 2023, but that notice of discontinuance was not served, and as at the date of these submissions, has never been served. orders were made by [the] judicial registrar [...], in chambers, for the father's application to be dismissed on 24 may 2023 following his notice of discontinuance being filed, but without prior notice to the mother nor her solicitors. the orders sought by the applicant father in the discontinued proceedings sought to discharge final parenting orders made by consent on 25 june 2020 (the 2020 orders), and replace them with new orders which were substantially the same as the 2020 orders, with two key differences being: 2.1 that instead of the mother holding the children's passports, that the father hold the children's passports (see order 7 of initiating application filed 3 november 2022 \"initiating application\"), and 2.2 that the father have \"primary parental responsibility for the children\" whereas the 2020 orders provide for equal shared parental responsibility (see order 1 of initiating application). submissions in relation to costs whilst the general principle is that each party bears their own costs, this is a matter where the mother submits the court should deviate from that principle pursuant to section 117(2) of the family law act 1975 (cth). the factors in section 117 which are relevant to these proceedings are: section 117(2a)(c) and (d) \u2013 the conduct of the parties and failure to comply with previous orders of the court: the initiating application filed by the father was wholly unnecessary. the 2020 orders provide for the mother to hold the passports. the mother made it very clear that she was prepared to provide the father with the children's passports, which pursuant to order 26(a) of the 2020 orders, was \"the last changeover prior to international travel\". this would have been [late] 2022 (see paragraph 18 of the mother's affidavit). his demand the passports be provided to him earlier was contrary to the 2020 orders. prior to the hearing on 16 november 2022, the father was invited to collect the passports at an earlier time from the mother's solicitors' office, notwithstanding that it was earlier than was required by the 2020 orders (see paragraph 23 of mother's affidavit and affidavit of [ms j]). he elected not to do so. section 117(2a)(e) and (f) \u2013 whether any party has been wholly unsuccessful, and any offers made: orders were not made altering the 2020 orders as sought by the father. effectively the orders made on 16 november 2022 were in accordance with what was proposed by the mother by way of correspondence on 11 november 2022. the father was wholly unsuccessful in his interim application, which was for the mother to post the passports to him and that \"upon the father's receipt of the children's passports he will become the custodian\" (order 3 of interim orders sought in his initiating application). notably the father gives evidence that the 2020 orders had to be amended because his lawyers at [b lawyers] considered them problematic. the 2020 orders were drafted whilst he was represented by [b lawyers] and the mother by [c lawyers]. there is no evidence that those orders are improperly drafted nor defective. indeed the father discontinued the initiating application and the 2020 orders remain in full force and effect. no additional variations are now proposed save for that the court retain custody of the children's passports. this application is contrary to the rules and is dealt with below. section 117(2a)(a) \u2013 the financial circumstances of the parties: the mother submits that the father has the capacity to pay the costs ordered, and that her financial circumstances are far inferior to the father's. according to his financial statement, the father has assets, exclusive of superannuation, of over $1 million. the mother has assets, exclusive of superannuation of approximately $300,000. the father earns $4,720.30 per week gross. the mother earns $2,032 per week gross. the mother has borrowed $15,000 from her mother to pay legal costs in relation to these proceedings and family violence proceedings commenced by the father (see mother's financial statement). it is acknowledged that indemnity costs are only granted in exceptional circumstances. the principles in colgate-palmolive co v cussons pty ltd, as noted by neville j in manuel & pinner (no 3) [2022] fedcfamc2f 1235 at [228] is regularly cited authority for relevant principles regarding the awarding of indemnity costs. justice sheppard in colgate-palmolive co v cussons pty ltd [1993] fca 536 at [5], sets out examples where indemnity costs might be warranted: i instance the making of allegations of fraud knowing them to be false and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud (both referred to by woodward j in fountain and also by gummow j in thors v weekes, evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the court and to other parties (french j in tetijo), the fact that the proceedings were commenced or continued for some ulterior motive (davies j in ragata) or in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (woodward j in fountain and french j in j-corp), the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (davies j in ragata), an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg messiter v hutchinson, maitland hospital v fisher (no 2), crisp v kent) and an award of costs on an indemnity basis against a contemnor (eg megarry v-c in emi records). [citations of cases listed omitted, underlines added] these proceedings were commenced as a consequence of the father's refusal to comply with existing final orders. he refused to accept the children's passports from the mother at the last changeover before his international travel, and from the mother's solicitors at an earlier time when invited to do so. the court might infer from his final orders sought that his motive was his wish to control the children's passports and agitate for sole parental responsibility, notwithstanding these issues having been dealt with in the 2020 orders. even now, after discontinuing his proceedings to vary the final orders, he reagitates and prolongs this matter by seeking orders in relation to the passports. this is a matter which falls squarely within several examples of where there is an exceptional circumstance which would warrant an order for indemnity costs, both in relation to the substantive proceedings and this application in a proceeding for costs. submissions in relation to order 2of the father\u2019s response to an application in a proceeding the father seeks as order 2 of his response in an application in a proceeding dated 25 august 2023 (response), that \"the children's passports are to remain with the court registrar [...] and be made available to either party upon written notice to the other.\" the mother seeks that order of the response be dismissed and that the father pay the mother's costs to respond to that order on an indemnity basis. the passports are no longer held with the court, and the court has indicated to the mother via the passport register that the passports are \"not be returned as per orders 25/6/20 on cac 2318/2018 (order 25)\". the father is on notice of this fact, as the court's passport register was served upon him on 29 august 2023. notwithstanding that, he presses his application. there is no substantive initiating application on foot in relation to parenting orders, as the father's previous initiating application has been dismissed. orders in relation to passports cannot be sought by way of a response to an application in a proceeding, where the only application in foot is in relation to costs. the fcfcoa rules deals with specific restraints on interlocutory applications: rule 5.02(2) states: \"a person may apply for an interlocutory order only if the order sought relates to a current proceeding, unless the person is seeking: (a) permission to start a proceeding or extend a time limit to start a proceeding, or (b) to be appointed as a litigation guardian for a person under rule 3.15, or (c) an order for costs.\" rule 2.01 states: \"(3) a person must not file an application for an interlocutory order unless: (a) an application for final orders is current in the proceeding, or (b) the application includes an application for final orders.\" table 2.1 at item 1(h) includes that an application seeking final orders, for example an \"order relating to a passport\", is to be filed by way of an initiating application (family law). if the father wishes to relitigate the issue of who holds the children's passports, the process for doing so is by filing a fresh initiating application and satisfy the court as to the test in rice and asplund. however, prior to that occurring, he will need to comply with the pre-action procedures. on the basis that there is no jurisdiction to hear order 2 of the response without substantive parenting proceedings on foot, the mother seeks that the following paragraphs of the father's affidavit filed on 25 august 2023 (uploaded to comcourts on 28 august 2023) be struck out or not read, as those paragraphs appear to relate to order 2 of his response, or are not relevant to these costs proceedings: paragraphs 24-29, the second sentence in paragraph 48, paragraphs 49\u201167 of the affidavit of [mr renner] filed on 25 august 2023. if the above paragraphs are read, or the court determines that it will hear the father's application regarding the children's passports, as a matter of procedural fairness to the mother, she will need the opportunity to file an affidavit in reply prior to any determination being made. the mother contends that the allegations contained in the above paragraphs are irrelevant, misleading and/or inadmissible. given the father's non-compliance with the rules and attempt to reopen proceedings he has just discontinued, the mother seeks that this application in a proceeding regarding costs also be paid on an indemnity basis. her application in a proceeding has been amended accordingly and filed at the same time as these submissions. the writer who has temporary carriage of this file, has identified overlaps with costs claimed in the fvo proceedings, and has corrected the amount sought accordingly. if the court is not minded to order costs on an indemnity basis in a fixed amount, rather than the extra time and expense of taxing the mother's costs, the mother proposes in the alternative that costs be fixed at two-thirds of the total costs, or in the alternative in accordance to the scale. the father was put on notice via letter on 29 august 2023 (see tender bundle) that if he persisted in further orders regarding passports, further costs would be added to the mother's application. a ledger and schedule of costs calculated at two-thirds of indemnity costs and on scale is annexed to the mother's amended application in a proceeding. written submissions on behalf of the respondent outline of principle ) in considering what order (if any)

such offer, and (g) such other matters as the court considers relevant. such other matters as the court considers relevant. ] section 117(1) of the act provides: \u201c[s]ubject to subsection (2), subsection 70nfb(1) and sections 117aa, 117ab, 117ac and 118, each party to proceedings under this act shall bear his or her own costs.\u201d [63] section 117(2) of the act provides that if, in proceedings under the act, the court is of opinion that there are circumstances that justify it in doing so, it may, subject to sub-ss (2a), (4) and (5), and the applicable rules, make such order as to costs, whether by way of interlocutory order or otherwise, as it considers just. [64] section 117(2a) of the act provides that in considering what order (if any) should be made under s 117(2), the court shall have regard to the matters set out in paragraphs (a) to (g). in fitzgerald (as child representative for a (legal aid commission of tasmania)) v fish and another [2005] famca 158, (2005) 33 fam lr 123 the full court (kay, warnick and boland jj), referring to s 117(2a), said at 130 [41]: a number of factors are then listed in the subparagraphs. the financial circumstances of each of the parties to the proceedings is the first mentioned factor. nowhere in subs (2a) or elsewhere in s 117, is there any prescription that more than one factor must be present before an order for costs is made nor of comparative weight of the factors set out in subs (2a). as a consequence, there is nothing to prevent any factor being the sole foundation for an order for costs. ] as to the relationship between s 117(1) and s 117(2) of the act in penfold v penfold (1980) 144 clr 311, in joint reasons, stephen, mason, aickin and wilson jj said at 315: it is an accurate description of s. 117 (1) to say that it expresses a general rule, provided that it is firmly understood that the sub-section is not paramount to s. 117 (2). as sub-s. (1) is expressed to be subject to sub-s. (2) the former must yield whenever a judge finds in a particular case that there are circumstances justifying the making of an order for costs. sub-section (2) requires a finding of justifying circumstances as an essential preliminary to the making of an order. beyond this there is nothing in the subject matter or in the interrelationship of the two provisions which imposes any additional or special onus on an applicant for an order for costs. consequently, with respect to their honours in the family court, we do not agree with the suggestion made in the judgment under appeal that an order can only be made under s. 117 (2) in \u201ca clear case\u201d. (emphasis added) ] as to the nature of the hearing of an application pursuant to s 117 of the act in penfold their honours said at 315-16: sub-section (2) does not in our view as a matter of law require the judge to specify the circumstances which justify the making of an order. it does not expressly say so, and in the context of the making of an order for costs there is no sufficient basis for making an implication. judges very frequently make orders for costs without giving reasons or making findings, even when costs are in issue. the absence of reasons or findings does not in itself indicate that a judge has erroneously exercised his discretion to award costs, though it will place an appellate court in the position of examining the circumstances and of determining for itself whether the circumstances show that the discretion was erroneously exercised (kent v. kent [(1970) 92 w.n. (nsw) 503, at p. 505]). accordingly, in the absence of some positive legislative indication we should not attribute to parliament the requirement that a judge must make particular findings in relation to an order for costs. ] we also observe that in re jjt, ex parte victoria legal aid (1998) 195 clr 184 the majority of the high court (gaudron, gummow, hayne and callinan jj, kirby j dissenting) held that s 117(2) of the act referred to costs in the conventional sense and thus to the payment by one party to litigation of money by way of a partial indemnity for professional legal fees and expenses actually incurred by another party in the course of the litigation: see hayne j at 219. an order for costs is made to compensate a party against expense incurred in litigation and is not punitive in nature. costs are not a penalty or damages: latoudis v casey [1990] hca 59, (1990) 170 clr 534 per mason cj at 543 and mchugh j at 567, ruddock and ors v vadarlis and ors (2001) 188 alr 143 per full court of the federal court at [12] and brott and joachim [2006] famca 256, (2006) flc 93-259 per full court (holden, warnick and boland jj) at 80,403-404. an order for costs may be made on an indemnity basis, subject to a judicial determination capable of being made that there ought to be a departure from the usual basis that costs be payable on the party and party basis. for a discussion of the jurisdiction to order indemnity costs and its exercise see colgate palmolive co and another v cussons pty ltd (1993) 118 alr 248 per sheppard j at 256-257 and nmfm property pty ltd and others v citibank ltd (no 2) (court\u2019s \u201cnmfm\u201d judgment no 11) [2011] fca 480, (2001) 109 fcr 77 per lindgren j at [53] to [90]. it seems to me that the following principles or guidelines can be distilled out of the authorities to which i have referred:- 1. the problem arises in adversary litigation, i.e. litigation as between parties at arm's length. different considerations apply where parties may be found to be entitled to the payment of their costs out of a fund or assets being administered by or under the control of a trustee, liquidator, receiver or person in a like position, eg. a government agency or statutory authority. 2. the ordinary rule is that, where the court orders the costs of one party to litigation to be paid by another party, the order is for payment of those costs on the party and party basis. in this court the provisions of order 62, rules 12 and 19, and the second schedule to the rules will apply to the taxation. in many cases the result will be that the amount recovered by the successful party under the order will fall short of (in many cases well short of) a complete indemnity. 3. this has been the settled practice for centuries in england. it is a practice which is entrenched in australia. either legislation (perhaps in the form of an amendment to rules of court) or a decision of an intermediate court of appeal or of the high court would be required to alter it. no doubt any consideration of whether there should be any change in the practice would require the resolution of the competing considerations mentioned by devlin lj in berry v. british transport commission and handley ja in cachia v. hanes on the one hand and by rogers j in qantas on the other. the relevant passages from the respective judgments have been earlier referred to. 4. in consequence of the settled practice which exists, the court ought not usually make an order for the payment of costs on some basis other than the party and party basis. the circumstances of the case must be such as to warrant the court in departing from the usual course. that has been the view of all judges dealing with applications for payment of costs on the indemnity or some other basis whether here or in england. the tests have been variously put. the court of appeal in andrews v. barnes (39 ch d at 141) said the court had a general and discretionary power to award costs as between solicitor and client \"as and when the justice of the case might so require.\" woodward j in fountain selected meats appears to have adopted what was said by brandon lj (as he was) in preston v. preston ((1982) 1 all er at 58) namely, there should be some special or unusual feature in the case to justify the court in departing from the ordinary practice. most judges dealing with the problem have resolved the particular case before them by dealing with the circumstances of that case and finding in it the presence or absence of factors which would be capable, if they existed, of warranting a departure from the usual rule. but as french j said (at 8) in tetijo, \"the categories in which the discretion may be exercised are not closed\". davies j expressed (at 6) similar views in ragata. 5. notwithstanding the fact that that is so, it is useful to note some of the circumstances which have been thought to warrant the exercise of the discretion. i instance the making of allegations of fraud knowing them to be false and the making of irrelevant allegations of fraud (both referred to by woodward j in fountain and also by gummow j in thors v. weekes (1989) 92 alr 131 at 152, evidence of particular misconduct that causes loss of time to the court and to other parties (french j in tetijo), the fact that the proceedings were commenced or continued for some ulterior motive (davies j in ragata) or in wilful disregard of known facts or clearly established law (woodward j in fountain and french j in j-corp), the making of allegations which ought never to have been made or the undue prolongation of a case by groundless contentions (davies j in ragata), an imprudent refusal of an offer to compromise (eg messiter v. hutchinson (1987) 10 nswlr 525, maitland hospital v. fisher (no. 2) (1992) 27 nswlr 721at 724 (court of appeal), crisp v. keng (supreme court of new south wales, 27 september 1993, unreported, court of appeal)and an award of costs on an indemnity basis against a contemnor (eg megarry v-c in emi records). other categories of cases are to be found in the reports. yet others to arise in the future will have different features about them which may justify an order for costs on the indemnity basis. the question must always be whether the particular facts and circumstances of the case in question warrant the making of an order for payment of costs other than on a party and party basis. 6. it remains to say that the existence of particular facts and circumstances capable of warranting the making of an order for payment of costs, for instance, on the indemnity basis, does not mean that judges are necessarily obliged to exercise their discretion to make such an order. the costs are always in the discretion of the trial judge. provided that discretion is exercised having regard to the applicable principles and the particular circumstances of the instant case its exercise will not be found to have miscarried unless it appears that the order which has been made involves a manifest error or injustice. consideration & disposition associate: dated: 14 november 2023 dated: 14 november 2023 [1] the reasons that follow

reasons pursuant to section 69zl of the family law act 1975 (cth) (\u2018the act\u2019). these proceedings concern the best interests of x and y. x is 12, and y is eight (collectively known as \u2018the children\u2019). the applicant father, mr manjula (\u2018the father\u2019), is 44, and the respondent mother, ms bahri, (\u2018the mother\u2019) is 34. the parties migrated to australia after the children were born. the parties married in 2007, and separated in december of 2020. 2 there was a safety notice issued on or about 10 march 2021 for the protection of the mother and the children. the father issued proceedings in this court on 12 april 2021. on 17 may 2021 the father was charged with criminal charges of assault against the mother. those matters first returned to court on 10 october 2021 when the father was unrepresented, and will be listed for directions or mention on 9 february 2021. the father told me he intends to plead not guilty to those charges. 3 the matter returned to this court (as it then was) on the first occasion of 16 june 2021. on that occasion, orders were made by consent, including an order that the parents have equal shared parental responsibility, and orders were made for supervised time. i mention that because it is the father's case that the children's now demonstrated attitude to him, as reported to various professionals, is as a result of what is loosely described as alienation, or what could be put more neutrally as the children's exposure to the mother's attitude to the father. the father posits that the mother may be jealous in regard to him having a relationship with another woman during their marriage. a relationship, i might add, he has deposed to deeply regretting. 4 the other aspect is on 16 june 2021 the matter was adjourned for interim hearing, effectively for review before me. following those orders a number of events occurred. as is recited in exhibit c1 (the section 67z response from the department of families, fairness and housing), on 15 july 2021 the children were interviewed at school by child protection, and on that day the older child described to child protection an abusive relationship between herself and her father and also observing abuse of her mother, an incident of assault upon her and a strong statement that she did not wish to see her father. at that time, or it appears from that time, the younger child told the child protection that he loved his father but was angry with him, and it was observed that he was confused as to what he had observed and what he has been told. 5 it was recommended in that section 67z response, dated 29 july 2021, that the children engage in therapeutic services. the mother had commenced to consult a psychologist for her own support, one ms e (\u2018ms e\u2019), a well-qualified psychologist, and the mother had commenced consulting ms e from about 3 april 2021. i infer unknown to the father, x commenced to consult that same psychologist in or about late may 2021. y has not yet been able to see or engage in therapy with a psychologist or ms e. 6 that the child, x, was consulting with the same psychologist who had previously, and continued, to consult the mother, was not known to the father until this day, when it was properly and candidly advised to me by the mother's counsel. i am grateful to him and to the mother for providing me with that information. it had been, up until that revelation, common ground that the children would continue with the counselling under way. 7 in addition to the section 67z response, the court has the further information contained in the section 11f child inclusive conference memorandum (\u2018the memorandum\u2019). that memorandum arises from very recent interviews. paragraphs 20-26 of the child inclusive memorandum are recited below: x aged 12 ... 20. throughout the interview x presented as fearful of her father, recalling memories of times she has been exposed to incidents of significant physical and verbal violence perpetrated by mr manjula towards ms bahri. she further advised there were times this abuse had been directed towards her, confirming that he has previously \u201cpinned her down and choked her\u201d. x advised that she had never felt safe in the family home, prior to her parents\u2019 separation. 21. x advised that she does not want any form of communication or spend time to occur with mr manjula, clearly reporting that even if this was supervised it would cause her significant anxiety. considering x\u2019s presentation was consistent with someone who was suffering with significantly low mood, or possibly depression the writer asked x some more in-depth questions about her emotions. x reported that she is currently working with a psychologist, acknowledging that she regularly feels sad, and feels unable to change this. she reported no thoughts of self-harm or suicidal ideation, however expressed trouble getting to sleep, not wanting to eat and enduring low motivation. y aged 8 22. y is an 8 year old boy who initially presented as hesitant, reporting that he was scared to speak with the writer. considering this, ms bahri remained present whilst the writer introduced herself, and left when y was feeling more comfortable. y was a softly spoken child, and provided only short, and mostly non-descript answers. 23. when asked about his father, y attempted to answer, however started crying and was unable to speak. when he was able to compose himself, he described mr manjula as a scary man, reporting high levels of fear should he have to spend time with him. y further disclosed that he has nightmares about his father killing his mother and sister, leaving him without a family. y was highly resistant to the idea of engaging with a therapist, reporting that he did not want to speak about these topics and thought his feelings would get better with time. issues for the children 24. ms bahri gave a compelling account of the parties\u2019 relationship, presenting as genuinely fearful, and relocating to an undisclosed location, even though this has move highly disruptive due to safety fears that mr manjula potentially poses. 25. the history outlined, in addition to the children\u2019s presentation is indicative that x and y have likely been exposed to family violence. it is possible that this has had a significant impact on their emotional development trajectory, including their current capacity to feel safe and settled. considering this, the children require a period of time to heal and repair, which will allow them to begin processing their experiences. 26. the children are highly resistant to spending time with mr manjula, and this is potentially a direct result of their experiences. implementing spend time between mr manjula without the children firstly being emotionally receptive to this, could be more damaging for this relationship, and its potential to be re-established in the future. at this time, x and y would likely benefit from being freed of the expectation on them to see mr manjula, and instead focus on therapeutic intervention. 8 the father recently filed material responding to the mother's june affidavit, and that material demonstrates that between about the time of separation and up until either the 21 or 25 february 2021 (and nothing turns on it) a very frequent and, on its face, very affectionate communication between x and the father, and not just on an occasion, but over and over. 9 the communication between the father and the then 11 year old child can only be described as affectionate and close. the father points to the circumstance that that communication by text messages was followed, he says, by telephone communication of a similar nature up until about the time of the safety notice, and he points to, and asks me to infer, that the involvement of the safety notice process has interfered with his relationship with, firstly his daughter, and secondly his son. 10 this is an interim hearing, and i am endeavouring to follow section 82 of the decision of goode & goode [2006] flc 93-286. i cannot make determinations of fact in regard to contested hearings and contested facts. 11 the mother's affidavit sets out in compelling detail many incidents of serious family violence. those allegations are similar to what the child, x, has told child protection in july 2021, and what both children have told the court child expert on 1 november 2021. further, consistent with that, or sufficiently consistent for my purposes today, is the affidavit of ms e filed on 18 august 2021, which sets out ms e's view of the therapy as treating psychologist for x. the third and fourth paragraphs of ms e\u2019s statement annexed to her affidavit state as follows: x has strongly asserted that she does not want a relationship with her father. she expressed high anxieties about seeing or even speaking to her father over the phone.she stated that her father has a tendency to raise his voice and start conflict unnecessarily, and she does not feel safe around her father. she stated that if her father does attempt to call her that she would reject the call or hang up on him. she has stated that she does not feel like her anxieties about her father would be comforted even if her father were to engage in counselling, anger management programs or men\u2019s behavioural change programs because she feels like any change from her father would be \u201can act\u201d and not genuine change. she stated that neither she nor her brother have ever had a positive relationship with their father. she reported that their father did not spend any time with them, and on the rare occasion he did the experience would be negative. 12 the father's affidavit that he filed annexing the text messages has been filed after the section 11f child inclusive conference memorandum, after the child protection interview, and after ms e has prepared her document. there is no evidence that any expert or professional has had the opportunity to turn their mind to what are the otherwise affectionate communications between x and the father, demonstrated by the text messages. further, the father's affidavit recites, or includes photographs that, on the face of those photographs, demonstrate a close and affectionate relationship. 13 the timing of these events, that is, the cessation of the father's communication with x following the safety notice and the involvement of police and child protection authorities, cannot, on this interim hearing, persuade me one way or the other, and were i to press either ms pham or mr foo, each would be able to argue how those events are consistent with their client's case, and i make no such finding. but it is a fact that there is no evidence of that communication being considered by any expert. it is also unclear to me whether ms e was ever aware of such communication. 14 further information is available from the report of ms f (\u2018ms f\u2019). what is clear is that at the expense of the father, there was an attempt at professionally supervised time by a service that is widely regarded as competent and able to safely support children in a supervised setting. what the report of ms f sets out is that the service was unable to make the supervised time happen, and the supervisor was told by x that bad incidents had occurred with her father, and also with her father and mother, and that she did not want any contact with her father. the second and third paragraphs of page 7 of 8 of the report form ms f is set out below: she told me she is in grade 6 and wants to be a psychologist. she had something in her hands (i couldn\u2019t make out what it was, it was fairly long and looked rubbery) and she was twisting it nervously throughout our conversation. i explained my role, to supervise meetings, make sure the children involved were safe and enjoying their time. i advised i could terminate a meeting if i saw the need, the idea of the visit being for the children to be happy and enjoy themselves. rain said bad incidents had occurred in the past that involved her father and her, and also her father and mother. she said she didn\u2019t want any contact with her father. we chatted a bit more and then ms bahri called her son over. he looked tense too, and said he didn\u2019t want to see his father at all either. 15 the father concedes there are serious problems, and as such, seeks that the previous supervised time now proceed by way of family therapy. mr foo, on behalf of the mother, says that the strength of the children's wishes, and the nature of the abuse that he says they have suffered, indicates that that time should not proceed at this stage. i simply cannot make all the necessary findings today, nor do i simply follow someone else's opinion (who is not before the court) as to what has occurred. 16 it is clear enough that the child protection authority from the section 67z response proceeds on the basis that the events as described by the mother have, in fact, occurred. i do not proceed on that basis, and the law prohibits me from doing so, however, there is an unacceptable risk that the events as described by the mother may well have occurred, and there is an unacceptable risk that to continue with the children spending time with the father, even in the context of therapy, which is itself a very supervised regime, is contrary to the children's best interests. so i will not order the family therapy at this time. 17 i agree that there should be a review, which would include whether there should be supervised time, whether there should be therapy, whether there should be unsupervised time, should be in or about april of 2022. 18 the other significant issue that was in dispute, and that only came about when the father learned this morning that the counselling for the children that he was asked to consent to, and had agreed to, was with the mother's counsellor. mr foo has very properly raised with me the serious nature of interfering with the therapeutic relationship between the child, x, and her therapist, ms e. mr foo seeks that the therapy for x and y continue with ms e, and following discussion with me where i raised with him whether that was appropriate, quite generously in my view, the mother has changed her position to say that she would change therapists, but that because of the difficulty in establishing a therapist for x, that x should continue with ms e. 19 i am alert to, and concerned about, the serious impact upon x's welfare of interfering with that therapeutic relationship that she now has with ms e. i assume, and proceed on the basis, that ms e is a competent professional. having said that, i do not understand how ms e could prepare a report dated 21 june 2021, attached to an affidavit sworn/affirmed on 3 august 2021 and filed on 18 august 2021, whereby she provides to the father and the court a report in regard to x's therapy and x's position, and does not refer to or acknowledge that prior to x being her patient, the mother had been her patient. in my view, and it is my finding, in the particular circumstances of this case and the matters that are in issue, it is not in x's best interests that she continue to receive therapy from the therapist who is providing therapy to her mother, or to continue therapy with the therapist that has previously provided ongoing therapy to her mother. 20 this is because of the risk of a therapist conflating the mother\u2019s experience with the child\u2019s experience causing the utility of the therapy to be eroded. the risk is readily apparent were the prospect of the child attending the father\u2019s therapist to be contemplated.[1] 21 so my ruling is that i will grant the application, or effectively the determination, that the ongoing therapist for x should be a different therapist, and in the event of a dispute between the parents, should be a therapist as nominated by the independent children's lawyer. 22 the further conduct of this case is such that i am going to refer the case to the national assessment team of the now combined courts and transfer the matter to division 1 of this court, and that is because of the likely complexity and duration of the case. it may resolve, it may only proceed on limited issues, but certainly, if it proceeds on all of the issues that have been alive before me today, it appears to me to be well nigh impossible for the matter to proceed over microsoft teams and be contained to three or four days, which is the outer limit of cases to proceed before me. 23 i note that neither party sought to transfer the matter to the other division, and there can be no suggestion that either party is seeking some form of jurisdiction shopping or tactical advantage. it was because of my concern at the potential length of the final hearing that i raised this issue. witnesses could include the writer of the section 11f report, the child protection worker or workers who spoke to the children in july, ms e as the mother's therapist and as the therapist for x up until this time, the mother and the father, and a family report writer, and/or dr c (\u2018dr c\u2019). in addition, the mother or the father may, not necessarily will, call other witnesses. when both parties require the assistance of an interpreter, experience tells me, whether on microsoft teams or in person, that that is stretching the bounds of possibility to keep the case within three days, or even four. 24 for all of those reasons, and because of the complexity of the issues in the case, i have determined that i will transfer the matter for referral to division 1, with a notation, or request, that the matter be listed for further interim hearing following the release of dr c's report in or about april or may of 2022. i also note that were the matter to be fixed for final hearing before me, i would not be fixing it before february of 2023, given the number and nature of the other 320-odd cases in my docket, and i personally want to say to the parties i regret that circumstance, and regret that i cannot keep the matter before me and have a hearing well before way out then. 25 another dispute was the nature of the documents that should be provided to the children's counsellor and/or dr c, and the father objects to the section 67z response dated 29 july 2021 going to either of those persons, because of what appears to be the difficulty of determining whether matters are reported as allegations or as findings of fact by the child protection practitioner. in particular the paragraph on page 2 of 3 which states: on 27 july 2021 a family violence portal check was conducted and confirmed there have been 8 l17 reports with mr manjula the respondent in all incidents. 3 of the reports are due to breaches of the intervention order due to his use of social media in attempting to contact ms bahri. mr manjula was frequently attending the family home following the parents separation, causing the family to be fearful. an intervention order was made however mr manjula continued to attend the home, attempt to contact ms bahri and made threats to kill her should she leave him. 26 the father strongly asserts he has not breached any intervention order, and he has not been charged with any breach of any intervention order. he denies all of the allegations against him. i will note in this order that the father asserts that the section 67z response contains statements that are controversial or disputed, and that he asserts he has not breached any intervention order or been so charged. however, in my view, it is important that those professionals involved in the case have all of the relevant information in the raw. 27 rather than set out twice the documents to go to the children's counsellor, (which will now not be ms e) and to go to dr c, i would ask counsel and solicitor to redraft the orders to give effect to these reasons with a statement somewhere at the start saying, \u201cfor the purpose of these orders the following documents are referred to as 'the relevant documents',\u201d and then each of the orders referring to dr c or the child's counsellor will simply refer to the relevant documents. 28 my ruling is that whilst paragraph 7 of your order, ms pham, should be that only the father should attend those courses, the minutes of orders should note that there is no finding that either parent's parenting is deficient and requires a course. i will not compel the mother to do it at this stage because she has enough on her plate with sole parenting, school, her own counselling, and x and y's counselling, but such education may well assist her in the future, and she may well choose to do it, if for no other reason only to know about the type of information that the father has been provided. i will ask that you both note that is the context in which i am not compelling the mother to do that. the independent children\u2019s lawyer may take a different view, in which case the issue would be alive on another occasion. associate: dated: 16 november 2021 [1] this paragraph has been added when settling the ex tempore reasons.", "metadata": {"filename": "121.txt", "size": 27571, "chunk_index": 0,

banking corporation. legal principles 25 in whitford & whitford [1979] famca 3, (1979) flc 90-612 at 78,145, the full court said: in ordinary parlance, hardship means something more burdensome than \u201cany appreciable detriment\u201d. we consider that in subsec. 44(4) the word should have its usual, though not necessarily its most stringent, connotations. it is impossible to lay down in advance what particular facts may or may not amount to hardship in the relevant sense. we observe that in family law (2022, 7th ed) at [36.120], riethmuller and smith note that what constitutes appreciable detriment necessarily depends upon the circumstances of each case, stating that: in many cases the substantial detriment is the inability of a spouse to pursue a claim for maintenance or an alteration or property interests where the resulting loss is significant in the light of his or her financial circumstances. the applicant for relief\u2019s prospects of success in the proceedings, if leave is granted, is relevant to both the question of hardship and the second task undertaken by the court, which is to consider matters going to the exercise of discretion generally. this is because \u201c[if] the probable result of the hearing on the merits is that hardship is not likely to be alleviated, then the court cannot be satisfied that the applicant would suffer hardship if leave were not granted\u201d: v and s [2006] fcwa 2 (\u201cv and s\u201d), per thackray j at [6]. as recently noted by austin j in skelton and lindop [2022] fedcfamc1a 47, (2022) 64 fam lr 617 (\u201cskelton and lindop\u201d) at [16]\u2013[21], there is differing authority as to the test to be applied in determining the prospects of success. those tests range from the need to establish \u201cprima facie claim\u201d to the need to establish \u201ca real probability of success.\u201d we respectfully acknowledge and adopt the reasoning of austin j that the appropriate test to apply is whether the applicant for relief had \u201csufficient likelihood of success\u201d to prove hardship. in the event of the trial judge finding that the applicant for relief would suffer hardship if an extension of time was not granted, it is then necessary for the trial judge to consider those matters going to the exercise of discretion. in v and s, thackray j noted at [7] that, in addition to prospects of success, other potentially relevant considerations to the exercise of discretion may include the following: the extent of the delay and the reasons (or absence of reasons) for the delay: althaus & althaus (1982) flc 91-233, the extent of the hardship the applicant would experience if leave were not granted: carlon & carlon [1982] famca 60, (1982) flc 91-272, and the extent of the prejudice that would be caused to the respondent if leave were granted. in frost & nicholson [1981] famca 45, (1981) flc 91-051 (\u201cfrost & nicholson\u201d) at 76,425, nygh j said that prejudice, in this context, \u201cmeans that a party is faced with an action which he or she had no reason to expect or had been led to believe would not be brought\u201d. however, in atwill & atwill [1981] famca 72, (1981) flc 91-107 (\u201catwill & atwill\u201d) at 76,794, nygh j stated that the relevant prejudice would need to be \u201cdistinctly observable hardship, such as financial commitments made on the basis that no liability existed\u201d. it appears to us that the extent of any prejudice is simply one of the relevant factors to consider and that nygh j\u2019s comments in these two cases should be read as descriptive of circumstances where prejudice is likely to be a weighty factor, not a test for the relevance of evidence of prejudice. additionally, in atwill & atwill, his honour also pointed out that the fact that the respondent will suffer prejudice does not necessarily mean that the discretion will be exercised in their favour. ... applications seeking an interlocutory order under s 44(3) of the act are generally dealt with on the basis that the applicant\u2019s evidence is presumed to be correct \u201cunless it is inherently unbelievable or contradictory\u201d (jacenko & jacenko [1986] famca 25, (1986) flc 91-776 at [14], skelton & lindop at [36]). it is important to appreciate that it is only in the event of leave being granted that the court, at final hearing, will make a determination in respect to the accuracy or otherwise of the parties\u2019 competing factual contentions. ... it is true the appellant did not lead evidence to explain why she omitted to bring her claim with the two-year limitation period, which is of course usually an influential factor, but it is not of itself necessarily fatal (emerald & emerald [2018] famcafc 217, (2018) flc 93-870 at [128], carlon & carlon [1982] famca 60, (1982) flc 91-272 at 77,533). significantly, the appellant sent a letter to the respondent in march 2018 (just before the limitation period expired) foreshadowing her intention to bring a claim, so he was on notice. the primary judge was satisfied the further eight months which then elapsed before the claim was actually filed in november 2018 was \u201cnot substantial\u201d (at [94]). moreover, the primary judge found the only prejudice the respondent would suffer if the appellant\u2019s claim was allowed to proceed out of time would be the legal costs he would bear in defending her claim \u2013 but he would have been put to that expense anyway if the appellant\u2019s claim was brought within time. discussion deputy associate:

(3) the court may make an order under subparagraph (1)(c)(iv): the examining party must not cross-examine the witness party personally, (b) the cross-examination must be conducted by a legal practitioner acting on behalf of the examining party. the cross-examination must be conducted by a legal practitioner acting on behalf of the examining party. on its own initiative, or (b) on the application of: the witness party, or (ii) the examining party, or (iii) if an independent children's lawyer has been appointed for a child in relation to the proceedings--that lawyer. i) if an independent children's lawyer has been appointed for a child in relation to the proceedings--that lawyer. ... it must be acknowledged that section 102na is a draconian and drastic restriction upon the time honoured right of a party to cross-examine another party or witness giving evidence contrary to him. the section 102na scheme is, as discussed in the decisions cited, for the protection of victims of alleged family violence, and to prevent the re-traumatisation of the alleged victim by the cross-examination process when it is being carried out personally by the other party. hand in hand with that draconian restriction is the generous scheme when a party is prevented from cross-examining. parliament has set aside a separate bucket of money to be administered by state legal aid bodies for the purpose of ensuring the representation of the restricted party. in this way, the other party can be cross-examined, but not by the litigant in person but by a lawyer. this has the collateral benefit that, inevitably, the otherwise unrepresented party obtains the benefit of the legal advice of the lawyer that would be undertaking the cross-examination. further, certainly in victoria, the scheme being administered by victoria legal aid has imposed conditions upon that grant of aid such that the lawyer appointed under the scheme effectively has the responsibility of the conduct of the entire case, not just the cross-examination of the other party. that comes with real advantaged and disadvantages. a litigant in person has at first been excited about the prospect of having a lawyer appointed for them at public expense, only to be profoundly disappointed when the lawyer has provided legal advice that runs contrary to what the person wanted or expected to hear. ... if section 102na mandatorily applies there is no discretion: the parties cannot cross examine each other and the resources of the section 102na cross examination scheme are made available and not means tested... associate: dated: 5 december 2023 dated: 5 december 2023", "metadata": {"filename": "1214.txt", "size": 5291, "chunk_index": 0, "total_chunks": 1, "original_size": 5321, "document_id": "1214"}}, "outputs": {"document_id": "1214_chunk_0"}}
